How would you handle this?", "selftext": "A lady I went to elementary school with, unexpectedly messaged me going crazy (IMO) with allegations that Trump is a rapist. I asked her to provide evidence of this, and she really couldn't come up with anything specific, other than the fact that if some women said it, then of course it must be true.  \n\n\nShe told me that she had suffered from date rape once, therefore Trump must be a rapist, apparently. I told her I was sorry that happened to her, but it had no bearing on Trump, and I politely suggested that her past experiences may have clouded her objectivity.  \n\n\nShe then unfriended me, so I provided a block in return.  \n\n\nNot quite sure where that one came from. Oh well, she's not a bad person, and she's mostly been pleasant in the past, so best of luck to her. She previously reached out to me often, and while I knew that she tilted left, this was the first time that she went off like this.  \n\n\nI tried to ask her if she has seen the Brian Banks story, but she did the defriending before she apparently read it. For those unfamiliar, Banks was a college football star with a bright future ahead, likely in the NFL.   \n\n\nA women he had dated accused him of rape and Banks was convicted, and sentenced to decades in prison. Project Innocence eventually stepped in and helped Banks to get this woman to admit that she lied and made up the entire story. He was freed from prison and his conviction overturned, but of course, he was incarcerated for years and never realized his dream of becoming an NFL star. I've provided a link to this story.  \n\n\nI'm not minimizing actual rape or sexual assault, obviously. Hell, I've personally arrested people for rape and sexual assault. I've interviewed the victims of rape and sexual assault, and I've taken them to the hospital and sat with them while we waited for the medical exam.   \n\n\nSo quite obviously, rape & sexual assault are beyond reprehensible, but I do think it's fair to say that there are also many men who are accused of doing something that they did not do.  \n\n\nBut here's the question, given my long history with this person, would you...  \n\n\nA. Lift the block (my presumption was that she would try to reach out and apologize.)  \n\n\nB. Leave it in place. You've known her for a very long time, but who needs drama like that?\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qhWJttp_T6c?si=bFdbNObulBn_0uQr", "url": "/r/Conservative/comments/1mnj03m/a_lady_i_went_to_elementary_school_with_suddenly/", "score": 28, "num_comments": 178, "domain": "self.Conservative", "post_url": "https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1mnj03m/a_lady_i_went_to_elementary_school_with_suddenly/", "author": "Stockjock1"}
