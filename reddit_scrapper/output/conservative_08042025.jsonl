That sounds say more like we the people than a Republic could ever be regardless of how constitutional it is.  the founders where great people but I feel they screwed up there.  id much rather have a \"tyranny of the majority\".  Than a tyranny of rogue politicians\n\n\nfor me a constitutional democracy is the best of both worlds.  No Representatives to lie to get elected and you have a constitution to restrict voting to some degree so you cant just vote for someone to be mugged or something.  it's much of the restrictions that people like about a constitutional republic without the rogue politicians to F everything up.\n\n\nNo more crying about politicians lying constantly and not caring about us would certainly be a wonderful thing I think.
