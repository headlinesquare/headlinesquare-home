Hundreds of American soldiers deaths can be attributed to Iran. Hundreds of thousands of civilians in Syria are dead because of Iran. Iran regime officials regularly kidnap, rape and kill their own young women who dare to leave their hair uncovered. Iran is currently the largest backer of jihadist terror groups. During the election, Iran literally tried to assassinate Donald Trump.\n\n\nIsrael has now done our dirty work for us and has destroyed almost all of Irans air defenses. We are taking it for granted because they made it look easy, but they sacrificed their lives to do it. No one wants American boots on the ground. A little targeted bombing of their nuclear reactors however, is well called for.\n\n\nWe will never have an opportunity like this again. I promise you this is our once in a generation chance to end the Iranian threat once and for all. If we walk away from this it will be a generational fuck up. What happens in this region affects us. What happens if Iran gets nuclear weapons? Some assessments point to the high probability of Iran distributing nuclear weapons to their terror proxies like the Houthis and Hezbollah. \n\n\nSome assessments point to Iran using them on American cities, as they have literally been threatening to destroy us for decades. I take them at their word. \n\n\nBe advised, the conservative movement and this subreddit are being manipulated by loud RINOS being paid by Qatar, and Iranian internet farms/pro palestinian activists masquerading as conservatives. \n\n\nI'll end with this.
