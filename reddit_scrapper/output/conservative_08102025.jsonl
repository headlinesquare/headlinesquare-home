I was very worried she was talking to another guy and/or having an affair. \n\n\nYesterday she was using her phone and put it down, went into the bathroom and started to shower. I realized she forgot her phone as lately she would basically hide it when showering. \n\n\nI went through her messages, contacts, calls, etc, and found nothing. No unusual pics, calls or emails.

Another post claimed we were \"on the right track\" regarding tariffs when we are certainly heading towards a great depression. This has caused me so much anxiety and mental anguish. She said it wasn't ok to attack federal law enforcement who we all know are terrorist agents of the orange man who is sending people to death camps!!!\n\n\nI packed up my stuff, took our kids and am staying at my mom's. I can't be in the same house as a nazi and my neodivergent, gender fluid 2 year old twins have been very sad about mommy being a racist pedo supporter and Russian agent. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?
