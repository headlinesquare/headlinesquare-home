The last few weeks, we have seen China hold a very strong outward appearance. However, when you search YouTube for \"China manufacturing US tariffs,\" you find videos deeply buried on how much the Chinese people are shutting down small manufacturing plants. Specifically to small companies, small supply chains that eventually lead to the US. Yes, we only make up 15% of their GDP with US trade. However, this whole situation has exposed how much they cheat the system with other countries not just the U.S. \n\n\nI am specifically posting this to show that these tariffs are severely affecting China. More than what they admit to. Even though China is not admitting it, and they are trying to suppress any information that would tell us otherwise from the country or on social media.", "url": "/r/Conservative/comments/1k1q01x/trump_tariffs_us_orders_from_chinese_small/", "score": 0, "num_comments": 3, "domain": "self.Conservative", "post_url": "https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1k1q01x/trump_tariffs_us_orders_from_chinese_small/", "author": "Iamstillhere44"}
