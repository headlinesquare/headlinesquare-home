{"created": "2025-05-15T13:10:21-04:00", "title": "Small business decline", "selftext": "While posting on a different thread, I was looking at Small Business numbers. The scary thing I found is that there are 30% less small business startups than there were 50 years ago. The percentage of people employed now by small businesses is barely 50%. It was higher back in the 70's.\n\n\nWhat this means is fewer people are taking the chance at running their own businesses. That means 30% fewer are taking a chance at Freedom from the status quo. That also means that both the cost and the Regulations that a small business owner has to get past are more onerous. From building owners who charge way too much for their property to government regulations that make it impossible to even get going, even out of a garage.\n\n\nMy own experience back in the 90's when I started working out of my house for my computer business. I eventually around 2005 I opened my own storefront and worked for 15 years running it. I saw the regulations, the restrictions and other issues escalate cost wise. I was even forbidden by city code to put a sign on the corner of the road and the main road pointing down to my business because it would be too ugly. UNDER the existing signs for other businesses. I was happy to semi-retire and move to a better state. Now I work part time through word of mouth and make a few bucks all under the radar of government and am happier. \n\n\nI have watched how millions and even billions are funneled to huge corporations that have the money but still get business grants from the State. You own a Football franchise, no problem, even though you are worth millions and millions and the NFL is worth billions, here we will give you a billion to help pay for the stadium you are going to build. BUT those of you small business people who need say $100,000 to open a little pizza shop or some other small business that will do well next to that stadium. Sorry no money for you. I have no problem giving tax breaks to those corporations but how about a freaking tax break to a Small Business. The best you get is 5 years that you can if you want use creative accounting to appear to lose money then you better show a profit or else you get audited. \n\n\nThe death of small business is the death of real Capitalism/Free Market.", "url": "/r/Conservative/comments/1kndlnt/small_business_decline/", "score": 93, "num_comments": 44, "domain": "self.Conservative", "post_url": "https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1kndlnt/small_business_decline/", "author": "ComputerRedneck"}
