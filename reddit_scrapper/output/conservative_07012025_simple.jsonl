They are, once again, being intentionally misleading in order to make a headline. Elon Musk is complicit in propagating this misinformation. \n\n\nHow is the 3.3T number calculated?\n\n\nThe BB reduces government spending by approximately 1.2T. The TCJA of 2017 added 4.5T in tax cuts. The difference between these numbers is 3.3T.
