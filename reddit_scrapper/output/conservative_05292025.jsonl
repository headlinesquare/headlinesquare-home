Denying any good thing he does and twisting it around to be a net negative. Mainstream media plays a HUGE role in this. For example, the dog-piling on President Trump when he called out Ramaphosa for his country's violence towards white farmers and White South African refugees.\n\n\nAnger:\n The most prominent stage. WAY too many examples to list here, but ones that stand out to me are:\n\n\n\n\nending friendships and disowning family members for voting for Trump or not voting for Kamala\n\n\nreacting violently to people wearing MAGA hats\n\n\nrioting (or, in their words, \"peacefully protesting\")\n\n\nthreats of violence or worse towards people that don't wholeheartedly agree with their views\n\n\n\n\nBargaining:\n Some leftists bargain with other TDSers to ruin President Trump's second term. \nDon't know how detailed or Real I can get here without risking a site-wide ban\n. Aside from that, no other form of reasoning exists.\n\n\nDepression:\n You may have seen posts on platforms like Reddit, TikTok, and Twitter. Leftists freaking out, sobbing and screeching like banshees the nanosecond it was formally announced that Trump had won back in November. Some colleges and professors actually cancelled classes for days or even weeks so students could \"take time to process their grief\". To this day, leftists whine in despair about how they're constantly being attacked by Trump and his supporters just for \"existing\".\n\n\nAcceptance:\n Non-existent.\n\n\nTL:DR: Leftists are incapable of expressing their disapproval of President Trump in a normal and healthy way.", "url": "/r/Conservative/comments/1ky844b/the_five_stages_of_tds/", "score": 9, "num_comments": 53, "domain": "self.Conservative", "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/1ky844b/the_five_stages_of_tds/", "author": "v1nesauce", "fullname": "t3_1ky844b", "thumbnail": null}
