I’ve also written about the number of times the Trump administration has been blocked by lawsuits, including with Medicaid \nfunds\n for Planned Parenthood, Trump’s birthright citizenship \norder\n and \nfree speech\n on campus.\n\n\nFrom Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs (\nproof\n):\n I’m an investigative reporter for the Times’s national desk, and I’m on the ground in D.C.\n\n\nI’ve spent much of the last two weeks \ntracking down\n what the federal agents here are doing, whether it’s recovering guns during traffic stops or trying to evict \nhomeless people\n. I’ve also looked into what the \nnumbers show\n about children committing crimes in the District, and written about the man charged with assaulting a Border Patrol agent \nwith a sandwich\n.   \n\n\nAll of these links are available for free, even without an NYT subscription.\n\n\nAsk us anything about what we’re seeing on the ground, the lawsuits that have ensued, and the national implications. \n\n\nWe’ll answer questions from 3 to 4 p.m. on Friday, Aug. 22.\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your questions and your interest in the atmosphere in the capital.
