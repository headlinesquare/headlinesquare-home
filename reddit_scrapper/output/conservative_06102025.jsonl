I just gotta vent to someone who cares about politics.\n\n\nI am so incredibly tired of hearing about the “peaceful LA protests”. Obviously I support ICE taking illegal immigrants back, they are simply enforcing the laws mind you, a law that almost every other country has. However, even if I were on the left, it would not be correct to say looting, throwing tear gas at cops, vandalizing cop cars, and stopping highway traffic are peaceful protests. Those are all punishable by law. I have never, in my life, seen a more blatant display of incompetence. It’s like the CNN interview all over again where the city was quite literally burning down and interviewer says the protests are mostly peaceful. \n\n\nDon’t get me wrong, if they were peacefully protesting, I wouldn’t support the cause, but I believe everyone deserves free speech. But they’re saying Trump is deploying arms of the military to “insight fear”?! Give me a freaking break. They are literally burning down the city and don’t understand why the military would need to step in? The same group that wanted the military to step in (and did in Portland and Minneapolis) to enforce curfews and mask protocols during COVID? Which granted, was a crime technically, but wasn’t even a violent one. How are they so blind as to not see any issue with what they are doing? And to have the gall to wave the Mexican flag and say we can enjoy their food anymore. Like I’m sorry, but we’re not the ones bunching together ALL immigrants to be Mexican, YOU ARE, though the majority happen to be due to obvious geographical advantages. We want all illegal immigrants deported, not just Mexicans. And don’t even get me started on the stolen land crap. If they wanna pull that card (which isn’t even accurate), Mexico is “stolen” land too, so do they not get to stay there either?\n\n\nSorry this is a long rant, but I’ve been holding it in for days now and just needed to get it off my chest.
