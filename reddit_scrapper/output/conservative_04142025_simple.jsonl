Some nutjob started pointing the finger, saying “Well, if Trump hadn’t fired all those air traffic controllers…” blah blah blah.  I pointed out that not a single ATC had been fired.  They linked an article to try to prove me wrong, and I used that exact same article to defend the fact I presented. Blocked from the group almost immediately thereafter.\n\n\nIsn’t it funny how you NEVER see comments turned off on posts by conservatives?
