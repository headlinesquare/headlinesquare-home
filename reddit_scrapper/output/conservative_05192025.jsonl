We need to nip this sort of attitude in the bud and have our reasonable takes be louder than the crazies and acknowledge and denounce the crazies on our side. We can't capitulate to them or treat them with kid-gloves like the left does for theirs.\n\n\nEdit: yes the left is x100 worse, I agree, but I don't think we should wait until we get as bad before trying to make sure we're not controlled and represented by the most radical of our side. Let them speak like they always have, of course, but let them stay at the fringes and not get a foothold into our mainstream movements and rhetoric.\n\n\nAll I know is I don't want us to get anywhere near as bad as the left is now and the only way to make sure of that is to be vigilant and call this stuff out when we see it.
