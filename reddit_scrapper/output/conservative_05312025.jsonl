Whatever you think the reality was of Biden’s decline, it was much worse. Some highlights and direct quotes I don’t think we’ve heard about on the news/social media:\n\n\n\n\nAny pre-recorded video address would be filmed with multiple cameras and they would jump to different cameras/audio feeds during his stutters to make it look less bad\n\n\nWhen they White House released video of Biden walking around the lawn, they would release it in slow motion so you couldn’t tell how fast he was actually walking in real life\n\n\nIn 2021, multiple leaders of foreign countries described talking to Biden as “talking to your grandpa” as he veered so far off topic and went on an on about unrelated stories that aids had to constantly jump in to remind him of talking points\n\n\nSince Biden took so long to make quick decisions, briefings would present be presented as binary yes/no options in hope he wouldn’t notice and just sign off, rather than requiring nuanced conversations\n\n\nPrivate cabinet conversations required teleprompters and notes. His staff would call up cabinet members the morning of a meeting and demand they provide a transcript of what would be talked about and asked. They would write responses for Biden in advance, load them into a teleprompter, and have him read from it when cabinet members brought up their topics.\n\n\nMeetings and appearances were only allowed to be scheduled between 10AM and 4PM, whenever possible\n\n\nBy 2023, they would write down answers on notecards for mundane answers, such as what Biden was thankful for during thanksgiving. He would then read these verbatim when talking to press and interviewers.\n\n\nHosts were given questions to ask beforehand for all radio interviews Biden did during his presidency \n\n\nBiden would go up to his room at 5:15PM every day, very rarely ever coming back down unless absolutely necessary\n\n\nA cabinet secretary admitted, in 2021, that 5 people were running the country with Biden being a “senior board member, at best.”\n\n\nEvent hosts would often ask for a 5 minute video from the president, but were told he can only do 2 minute videos\n\n\nAids would plan out beforehand out every step Biden would take for public appearances. They rebuilt stages to have handrails and shorter walking distances to the mic, and began pushing speechwriters to shorten his remarks to the shortest possible.\n\n\nThe White House paid influencers, journalists, and other “operatives” to smear anybody who publicly questions Biden’s aid and were told specifically to paint them as “right-wing extremists”\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, with all the (sometimes rightful) criticism that Trump gets for lying and hyperbole, the Biden administration wasn’t really any better He said “on foreign policy, i am the most effective person ever. On national security, nobody has ever been a better president than I have been” which sounds like a very Trumpian thing to say. He constantly made up lies about his accomplishments, his family history, his contributions to America, and about Trump (whether intentionally, or just because he didn’t know what he was saying). Apparently, he and Kamala did not like each other at all. \n\n\nI think everybody here already knew this, but it’s interesting to see people in power admit that some of these issues started all the way back in 2017. Safe to say that by 2020, he was by no means fit to be president and in fact his doctor never once did cognitive tests during yearly check ups in office. \n\n\nAnyway, there’s my notes so you don’t have to get another cent to the man who was as involved as anybody in covering up one of the biggest lies in American politics.", "url": "/r/Conservative/comments/1l05feu/i_read_original_sin_by_jake_tapper_some_thoughts/", "score": 59, "num_comments": 21, "domain": "self.Conservative", "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/1l05feu/i_read_original_sin_by_jake_tapper_some_thoughts/", "author": "amenandgostillers", "fullname": "t3_1l05feu", "thumbnail": null}
