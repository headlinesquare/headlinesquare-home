{"created_utc": 1750628541.0, "title": "Trump’s attack on Iran - Why it matters beyond Iran", "selftext": "A lot has been discussed about the attack and I will start this post by acknowledging that a lot of conservatives didn’t like this action by the President.\n\n\nTheir criticism and scepticism is valid and we, conservatives that support this action, should listen to them and try to explain to them why this was the best decision. This post is primarily aimed at them but I hope it sparks a good discussion.\n\n\nIran is a theocracy. A regime that oppresses civil rights, that oppresses women, that oppresses his own people. The regime is built upon a view of the world where two famous sentences come to mind: “Death to Israel” and “Death to America”. We are talking about a country that sponsors terrorism, that supports terrorist organisations that have a stated aim to wipe out Israel and, when possible, inflict damages and hurt against American people whenever they have a chance. In summary, they are bad actors and need to be dealt accordingly. This means not trusting their words, but trusting their actions. This also means that even if Iran has a moderate President who actual calls the shots is Al Khamenei and the IRGC.\n\n\nA big mistake was made with North Korea. That mistake cannot happen a second time and especially in a more volatile area such as the Middle East. Time and time again Iran uses diplomatic negotiations to deceit America and the Europeans using the negotiations for a diplomatic deal, or even the previous deal, as a smokescreen for their actual aims - to have the capacity to build a nuclear weapon and be a second North Korea.\n\n\nThis attack matters not only because it is directed towards Iran but it also matters more widely. Although they will not say it in public, Saudi Arabia will be delighted by this. And this also removes the incentive for them to have a nuclear weapon, therefore less one country with reasons to have one in the Middle East. There’s a domino effect in the region with, if not the end, a definitive delay to Iran’s ambitions which means less troubles, less need for future involvement. As always these domino effects are not immediate, but they will happen.\n\n\nThis also matters, and even more, for China and their policy towards Taiwan. The sequence of events matter here. Trump was very clear that Iran couldn’t have access to nuclear bombs. He drew red lines, he gave deadlines and then he acted. This matters hugely because this shows to China that there will be heavy consequences for them if they try and take Taiwan. Well at least while Trump is in office.\n\n\nIn summary, this attack matters because it cripples Iran, removes the incentive for Saudi Arabia to have the ability to have nukes, avoids a race in the region towards nuclear, and it sends a strong signal to China.\n\n\nFinally, yes it is possible to have peace by strength. It is about defining clear red lines, stating the consequences of violating those red lines and following up on those consequences. And this is key because regimes like Iran, Russia and China only understand one thing: actions, not words…\n\n\nI know it is not an easy time to be conservative in this kind of situations. There’s no perfect solution, only the possibility to choose the least bad option of the list. This is what Trump did. No action is free of consequences but for Iran and its leadership the survival of the regime is key. And with this attack they understand if they retaliate then the regime will not survive… yes, they are fanatics, but their survival is even more important… \n\n\nI hope I managed to add something useful to this discussion.", "url": "/r/Conservative/comments/1lhzhvl/trumps_attack_on_iran_why_it_matters_beyond_iran/", "score": 0, "num_comments": 11, "domain": "self.Conservative", "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/1lhzhvl/trumps_attack_on_iran_why_it_matters_beyond_iran/", "author": "Head_Championship917", "fullname": "t3_1lhzhvl", "thumbnail": null}

Her order demands “restoration of pre-strike conditions to the greatest extent possible, including material restitution where feasible.”\n\n\nThe decision marks the latest in a string of judicial interventions against Trump’s foreign and domestic actions. Similar federal rulings previously halted Trump’s travel bans, border wall funding, and asylum restrictions. However, legal scholars note this ruling ventures into uncharted territory by attempting to retroactively nullify military action.\n\n\nThe White House called the decision “absurd and unenforceable,” and is expected to appeal.
