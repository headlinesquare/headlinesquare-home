Couldn't find something in the search tab for the \nr/Conservative\n thread, so I figured I'd ask!\n\n\nSO, as the title goes - im a dem. Most if not all of my friends are the same, and I wanted to get the perspective from republicans on the whole shipping / tarrifs on shipping situation. A bunch of countries have suspended shipping products to the US according to the news generally, and that's got me concerned.  From my democrat friends, I just hear the usual \"it's the republicans\" yadda yadda, without actually providing info about how it would be solved, what the goals are, etc etc etc.\n\n\nThe reason I reach out here is because, from what I can find, the news from both republican and democrat sides seem to be the whole \"fear mongering/gotcha\" style, and don't really provide perspectives on solutions? If that makes sense? What I'm trying to find is how would this fix anything, specifically.\n\n\nFrom what I've found so far, generally the conssensus is that if we impose tarrifs on other countries, that the US will produce it's goods in house - not an inherently a bad thing! The difficulty here from what I can find is that while we could produce said goods, we lack the actual resources for goods being that they are not always locally grown/mined/ found, and import them as a result. \n\n\nCan anyone weigh in on this? I'm getting tired of echo chambers and the news not really giving solutions  to problems, regardless of political affiliation. Genuinely not looking to blame, be rude, call people out, etc. I, like others of all affiliations, just want the consumer to be happy and healthy and not financially burdened, however that comes to fruition. \n\n\nHope this is okay to ask here! Thank you for being chill about having the dicussion too.
