These smart investments are essential to lowering electricity costs, and strengthening the job market and economy, and American energy independence. \n\n\n[Several of your Republican colleagues in the Senate and House signed on to letters in support of energy tax credits. I hope that you will add your name to this important letter and by doing so, stand up for an affordable energy future for all Americans.]\n\n\nSpecifically, I urge you to protect\n\n\n\n\nthe 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for residential and commercial rooftop solar systems; \n\n\nITC eligibility for schools, faith institutions, local governments, and other non-profits; \n\n\nthe Solar For All program to make solar more accessible to lower income families; and\n\n\nthe Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) which awards grants and loans for rural small businesses to invest in solar and other clean energy technologies.\n\n\n\n\nGoing solar helps families and local businesses save money by taking control of where their energy comes from. More local solar energy benefits everyone by generating energy where and when it’s needed the most.\n\n\nFederal investment in energy sources like solar have created more than 330,000 jobs across the country.\n\n\nThis is why in these divided times, solar is something that everyone can get behind. Majorities of Republicans, Democrats, and independents support federal investments in solar energy.\n\n\nThank you for reading my letter. I urge you to support keeping energy tax credits for everyday Americans. I look forward to reading your response[ - including if you will sign-on to the letter - as well as how you intend to vote should a repeal be brought to a vote].\"", "url": "/r/Conservative/comments/1k6f41x/scripted_letter_via_solar_united_neighbors_action/", "score": 7, "num_comments": 3, "domain": "self.Conservative", "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/1k6f41x/scripted_letter_via_solar_united_neighbors_action/", "author": "AutomatedTexan", "fullname": "t3_1k6f41x", "thumbnail": null}
