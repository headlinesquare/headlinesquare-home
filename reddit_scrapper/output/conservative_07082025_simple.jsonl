And I get where that comes from. There’s plenty of distrust in our institutions and the Epstein case is shady from every angle.\n\n\nBut I think it’s worth at least entertaining another possibility: maybe Epstein really \nwasn’t\n part of some vast elite child trafficking conspiracy. Maybe it was mostly just him and Maxwell doing horrifying stuff, and the rest of it, particularly the idea that there’s a massive network of politicians and celebrities involved, has been blown out of proportion.\n\n\nI’m not saying that to let anyone off the hook. I think a lot in Trump's orbit were pushing this stuff because it was politically expedient and now deserve the blowback they are getting. But before writing off Trump or this administration as “compromised” because they haven’t “released all the list,” it’s worth asking: what if there just isn’t as much there as people think?\n\n\nMichael Tracey has been pretty consistent on this and raise some good points if you're interested in more than just the surface-level outrage:\n\n\nhttps://x.com/mtracey/status/1942306599269433456\n\n\nCurious what others think.", "url": "/r/Conservative/comments/1luxsgl/before_blaming_trump_for_not_exposing_the_epstein/", "score": 0, "num_comments": 54, "domain": "self.Conservative", "post_url": "https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1luxsgl/before_blaming_trump_for_not_exposing_the_epstein/", "author": "matty25"}
