When they returned four days later, on July 11, they were no longer there.\n\n\nTwo guards fall asleep at their desk and two cameras in front of Epstein's cell malfunctioned the night he died, with a third camera with unusual footage.\n\n\nNow, we have the DOJ and the FBI showing an 11 hour long camera footage with them going \"LOOK, NOBODY CAME TO HIS CELL THE ENTIRE NIGHT!\"\n\n\nExcept there's a missing minute of footage between 11:59-12:00 AM, and now Bondi is saying \"Oh, that's because the video resets every night.
