It is not an appropriations bill, or a general budget bill. It provides no funding or authorization for 99%+ of the operations of government. It was written not by appropriators but some of the most conservative members of the House. It has not a single Democrat provision or vote.\n\n\nThe bill has three principal sections: tax cuts, welfare reform, immigration and border security.

I won't post it just because then they have to review it and it might not come through. But it can easily be found. \n\n\nSo FEMA, remember them, the ones who wouldn't provide aid to hurricane victims because they had Donald Trump signs in their yard, and no one got in trouble?\n\n\nWell this year looks to be one of the worst hurricane seasons yet. There's a new head of FEMA, and I guess was working on this year's hurricane plan. And was almost complete, but has completely scrapped it and decided to use last years hurricane plan, saying \" I guess theres an annual hurricane season here who knew?\". Remember how stranded and fuc*ed over people got from last year's plan. \n\n\nThe reason cited is because of cuts due to Donald Trump. Then why would they need last year's bloated budget? This is very very obviously done by people who dislike Trump and don't care about anybody else. Playing games. This isnt ok. \n\n\nThings like this are going to get people killed are going to cause people to die when they could be saved, have nowhere to go, also they can just look at Trump when this happens and say \"see this is your fault.\" They want people to suffer so they can point the finger at Trump. \n\n\nI don't know what to do but I feel like this is kind of a big deal and nobody's talking about it this way. So at the very least if you guys could keep this in the back your head so when it does happen we all know why.\n\n\nEDIT: cause people bring it up NOAA has a 60% chance it'll be a higher than normal season. A 30% chance it'll be similar season as last year, 10% chance it'll be less than.  CSU predicts this year will be 125% the avg of 1990-2020. I don't know why this was the center of focus but here you go.\n\n\nEdit: I know their predictions. I'm just saying why can't these people pull their bootstraps up and with the 66 billion dollar budget they have now. Maybe try and make it work. Instead of just saying well we're going to use the $190 billion budget from last year and let's hope that works... \n\n\nI hope none of it comes true!!!!", "url": "/r/Conservative/comments/1l34a59/please_keep_take_a_read_and_keep_in_the_back_of/", "score": 0, "num_comments": 23, "domain": "self.Conservative", "post_url": "https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1l34a59/please_keep_take_a_read_and_keep_in_the_back_of/", "author": "Jumpy-Program9957"}
