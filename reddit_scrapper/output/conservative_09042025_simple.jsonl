And it’s commanded.\n\n\nHijrah is not just a word for “migration.”\n\n\nIn Islam, it is a religious obligation to migrate to non-Muslim lands with the purpose of spreading Islam and establishing it as the dominant system.\n\n\nThis idea goes straight back to Muhammad himself, who fled Mecca to Medina in 622 AD, not to escape war, but to strategically build power. \n\n\nThat migration, known as the original Hijrah, marks the official beginning of the Islamic calendar, that’s how central and celebrated it is in Islam.\n\n\nFrom that moment on, Hijrah became a model for Islamic conquest:\n\n\n•Move into non-Muslim lands\n•Form insular Muslim communities\n•Build mosques and religious institutions\n•Gain legal and political footholds\n•Slowly implement Islamic norms and law (Sharia)\n•Ultimately, replace host culture with Islamic supremacy\n\n\nDon’t take my word for it. Take Muhammad’s:\n\n\n“I have been commanded to fight the people until they say ‘There is no god but Allah.’” — Sahih al-Bukhari 385\n\n\nThis isn’t just religious language. It’s a battle plan.\n\n\nThe Quran itself praises those who leave their homes for the cause of Allah:\n\n\n“Those who migrated for the cause of Allah after being wronged, We will surely settle them in this world in a good place.” - Quran 16:41\n\n\n“And whoever emigrates for the cause of Allah will find many locations and abundance.” — Quran 4:100\n\n\nMuslim Brotherhood ideologue Yusuf al-Qaradawi was blunt about it:\n\n\n“We will conquer Europe, we will conquer America, not through the sword, but through Da’wah (proselytizing) and Hijrah.”\n\n\nThis isn’t about bombs falling. It’s about a command to spread Islam. Always. Everywhere. No matter the conditions.\n\n\nAnd until America understands Hijrah as a weapon of conquest, we will keep losing ground - politically, legally, demographically, and culturally.\nCopied and shared.", "url": "/r/Conservative/comments/1n8brea/the_concept_of_hijrah_in_islam/", "score": 269, "num_comments": 68, "domain": "self.Conservative", "post_url": "https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1n8brea/the_concept_of_hijrah_in_islam/", "author": "Bananaseverywh4r"}
