Kennedy Jr. was confirmed as Secretary of Health and Human Services in February, we wanted to understand how the most famous family in Democratic politics was dealing with the fact that one of them was suddenly serving the Trump administration as it went after many of the institutions the family had helped build over decades. Our \nlatest cover story\n tries to understand that dynamic, as well as who the Kennedy family even is in 2025. (My colleagues made this \nhandy family tree and infographics\n to help.)\n\n\nI spent much of the past six months talking to some of the more than 100 Kennedys living today, as well as people who have known and worked with them over the decades. Many members of the family didn’t want to talk to me—or would only do so off the record—but all of the conversations helped me understand the complications that come with being part of a famous family suddenly made infamous in a new and unexpected way, and how they are all thinking about their place in modern American politics and society. As it often has, the story of the Kennedy family has plenty to tell us about America today. \n\n\nAsk me anything about how I reported this story and how a magazine cover comes together; the makeup of the modern Kennedy family and the Kennedys’ place in American politics today; and how they’re reacting to RFK Jr. I’ll be on around 12 p.m. ET to answer your questions. \n\n\nProof: \nhttps://imgur.com/a/PTFoX5w\n\n\n\n\nThe AMA is now over; that’s all for me!
