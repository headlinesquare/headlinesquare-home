Is there any solid, irrefutable historical evidence that either supports or disproves this narrative?\n\n\nAdditionally, she dismisses any sources she disagrees with (like calling Snopes biased toward Republicans) and refuses to watch the full context of the \"very fine people\" Trump speech. She often says her political science degree and 25 years in politics mean she knows better, even though she won’t engage with direct evidence.\n\n\nHow can I respond effectively to someone like this?
