The problem is not that they're dim (probably) but rather they've been victims of the most advanced and sinister psy op of all time by professionals who have perfected these techniques around the world to instigate regime change.\n\n\nYou can tell it's brainwashing because if you try to reason with them they resort to name calling, word salad and changing the topic. They really can't fathom that January 6th protests were about preserving democracy not overthrowing it. They can't imagine the motivation behind Obama spying on Trump's campaign or colluding with intelligence agencies to create hoax after hoax to delegitimize the rightfully elected president. It's almost too big of a scandal to wrap your mind around.\n\n\nI'm empathetic. They are not stupid or bad people, they are just caught inside the web of lies and can't find their way out. These are Americans. Many of them want to save America.\n\n\nHow can we undo the brainwashing and save these people?
