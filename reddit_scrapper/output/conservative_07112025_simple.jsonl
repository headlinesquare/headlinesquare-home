I truly believe that as high as 20% of the people in this country are here illegally, or anchor babies. (I also believe if you count the illegals, our population is much higher than 360m)\n\n\nThis source states most mexicans are here illegally\n\n\nWe can then use that to extrapolate from \nthis source that states there are 37.2m mexicans alone in america\n\n\nIf we figure only 60% of those are here illegally (and also likely severely undercounted due to illegals not participating in polls), Mexicans alone account for about 22 million illegals, fair bit higher than any other total number of illegals from all countries.\n\n\nThis also does not account for those who are here fraudulently through lying about asylum.\n\n\nThe extent of the damage done by people coming here and undercutting our labor, as well as abusing FES, EMTALA, and other social safety net systems will never be truly known, but it is far higher than any media source has ever claimed.\n\n\nTo make things simple to understand: people drive from Mexico to american hospitals, receive \"life saving\" \"emergency\" surgeries, then go back to mexico without paying a dime. And that is only one example of the abuse of our system. Multiply these scenarios times 30-100 million, and youll understand why America doesn't look like it did when you were a kid.\n\n\nI have a lot of insight into immigration, both legal and illegal, and will be posting more discussions regarding such.\n\n\nAmerica's full.", "url": "/r/Conservative/comments/1lxconp/the_amount_and_impact_of_illegals_on_our_country/", "score": 8, "num_comments": 8, "domain": "self.Conservative", "post_url": "https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1lxconp/the_amount_and_impact_of_illegals_on_our_country/", "author": "Material_Candle_5922"}

Is this wise statecraft?", "selftext": "I'm a supporter of the President, but unlike some here, I don't automatically agree with everything he does. I've been cautiously supportive of his tariff policy, but his recent threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports if Brazil's government goes ahead with its prosecution of former President Bolsonaro seems to me to be blatant interference in the internal affairs of another country.\n\n\nI don't even necessarily oppose tariffs over political matters (e.g., his threats of massive tariffs against Colombia when that country's President refused to accept Colombian deportees from America was IMHO entirely appropriate). But in this case, it is purely an internal matter that has nothing to do with the USA. We in America would never tolerate such blatant interference in our internal affairs.\n\n\nTrump seems poised to destroy our trade relationship with a major country simply because he's pals with the former President and therefore doesn't want to see him prosecuted. This is no way to run foreign policy nor trade policy.\n\n\nThoughts?\n\n\nEDIT: As a result of the spirited opposition I've encountered here, I went back and read for the first time the actual posting of the President regarding Brazil. The statement started off with a defense of Bolsonaro, but when it came to the actual threat of 50% sanctions, Trump related them to Brazilian laws targeting Americans and other Brazilian trade policies. Just another example of media corruption twisting a story to fit a narrative. \n\n\nI should have done my due diligence.
