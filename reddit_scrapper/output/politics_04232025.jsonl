As a staff writer for \nThe Atlantic\n and an author of the \nAtlantic\n Daily newsletter (which you can sign up for \nhere\n), I’ve been covering all aspects of the Trump administration. I’ve also just published my new book, \nThe Project\n, which details Project 2025 and what the plan could mean for everyday Americans for years to come. As \nI wrote earlier this year in The Atlantic\n, “The now-famous white paper has proved to be a good road map for what the administration has done so far, and what may yet be on the way.”\n\n\nToday, I’m here to answer your questions about how the second Trump administration is implementing Project 2025—and the changes that Americans across the political spectrum could expect to see. \n\n\nI’m happy to discuss what exactly Project 2025 is, who wrote it, how it could affect the lives of Americans, and anything else that might interest you.\n\n\nProof photo here: \nhttps://x.com/TheAtlantic/status/1914818876669337727\n\n\n------\n\n\nThank you all so much for talking with me today! It was a pleasure to answer your questions. Sign up for The Atlantic Daily to hear from me about the Trump administration and more:\n \nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/atlantic-daily/\n \n— David A.
