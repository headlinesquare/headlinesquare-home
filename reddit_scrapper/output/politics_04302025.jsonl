Ask me anything.", "selftext": "Edit: Thank you so much for the questions! I appreciate the mods for allowing us to host this AMA and hope to do another one soon.\n \n\n\nHi, I’m Alex Woodward, a senior U.S. reporter at the Independent. My work has covered everything from Trump’s immigration policies and legal battles to voting rights, anti-abortion laws, discrimination, and the rise of far-right movements and media. Recently, my reporting has highlighted Trump’s deportation agenda within his first 100 days in office: approximately 137 men have been transferred to a notorious prison in El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. Meanwhile, at least 1,500 student visas have been revoked across more than 250 universities, targeting international students — many of them pro-Palestinian advocates critical of Israel’s war in Gaza. Trump’s crackdown isn’t limited to immigrants; he’s openly stated he would be “very happy” to send “homegrowns” to El Salvador’s prisons too. \nAsk me anything. I will begin answering questions at 1:30 pm ET.\n\n\nHere are some links to stories that may be useful:\n\n\nOver 200 lawsuits, 142 executive orders, and 24 days golfing: Trump’s first 100 days by the numbers\n\n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-100-days-executive-order-numbers-b2739113.html\n\n\nTrump would be ‘very happy’ to send ‘homegrowns’ to El Salvador’s prisons.
