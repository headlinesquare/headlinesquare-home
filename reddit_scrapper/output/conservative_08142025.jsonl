To be clear, I am not here to promote it, as I've effectively shut it down.  I am the only remaining authorized user.\n\n\nAnyway, the goal was to see if republicans and democrats could find a way to get along.  Could they treat each other civilly?  Could they engage in respectful and intelligent discussions about politics?\n\n\nSo how did it go?\n\n\nI strived for some balance between conservatives and liberals.  However, in the end, it was likely at least 90% liberal/democrat.\n\n\nSome of our members were quite fair/reasonable, but in my opinion, most were not.  It became a S-show of members posting the same things over and over (Hitler/pedophile and all of that).\n\n\nBeing one of the few republicans on the sub, as moderator, I was attacked daily, mostly for my views, and to a lesser extent, but still persistently, for my moderation style, despite the fact that there were only 10-15 moderation actions by me (many were from Reddit) over a span of months.  The last 2 were 3-day bans, which I thought was quite fair, but others didn't think so.\n\n\nIn the end, it became quite a stressful situation and a real mess.  I did a poll asking if I should keep the sub running or not, and got a 100% \"yes\" response, but the next day, the same nonsense resumed, and thus, I made the decision to bring the experiment to a close.\n\n\nKind of a shame, but in the end I answered my own question as to whether those of different political persuasions could get along and have intelligent and respectful conversations about political matters, perhaps even finding some common ground and better understanding the other side's views.  Unfortunately, the answer was \"no\", or certainly not here and not now.\n\n\nIt's unfortunate, but the country remains quite divided, too divided in my view.  There is such a gulf between the views of the right and the left, it seems as there is little middle ground.\n\n\nMaybe someday this will change, but we're not going to fix it on Reddit.", "url": "/r/Conservative/comments/1mq68e7/termination_of_my_experiment_to_see_if/", "score": 60, "num_comments": 71, "domain": "self.Conservative", "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/1mq68e7/termination_of_my_experiment_to_see_if/", "author": "Stockjock1", "fullname": "t3_1mq68e7", "thumbnail": null}
