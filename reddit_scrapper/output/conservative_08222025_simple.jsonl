According to ICE, he was alone in his vehicle, about 2 blocks from a school, and his wife drove to him and got involved.\n\n\nLocal residents *DEMANDED*, in the middle of an arrest, that ICE show them their warrant.  Folks, that's not how this works.  The public can report wrongdoing, such as excessive force, but it's not their role to inspect or demand that any warrant or removal order be produced, as they are not involved.  To my knowledge, even the person arrested cannot resist and demand to see a removal order on the spot, although that information will be provided once the arrestee/detainee is secured, and presumably away from the public.\n\n\nI was in Mexico a few weeks ago.  As a tourist, I have limitations on how long I can visit the country.  I also have restrictions that state that I cannot work there and cannot overstay the legal limit on my visit.
