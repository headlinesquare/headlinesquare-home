AMA!", "selftext": "PROOF\n\n\nFriends,\n\n\nI know that this is an “Ask ME Anything” forum, but today, it is all of YOU that I am especially interested in.\n\n\nDay after horrible day, the Trump regime continues to bombard America and the world with decisions that are undermining democracy and harming millions of people. It’s not just a national stress test for democracy and decency. It’s also a personal stress test for all of us, including you.\n\n\nI’d like to know what you’re curious about, what you’re worried about, and what still gives you hope for the future. In turn, I’ll do my best to answer your questions about how we got here, what we might do about it, and what a more positive vision of the future might look like.\n\n\nTo kick us off, I want to share with you what gives me hope.\n\n\nAs many of you know, I taught at UC Berkeley for almost 20 years and witnessed its power as one of the most successful engines of upward mobility in America. \n\n\nI have been and continue to be fortunate enough to meet with and be inspired by younger generations of students and activists determined to keep up the fight against inequality and demagoguery. My hope is that they (and future generations) will be able to learn from the lessons I’ve witnessed firsthand — and correct the many ways my generation came up short. \n\n\nI love America and am proud of much that this nation has accomplished over my lifetime. I remain doggedly hopeful about the long-term future. But, undeniably, we and much of the world now face a brutal set of crises, headed by the decline of democracy and deterioration of the rule of law.\n\n\nI’m here from 1-2pm PT/4-5pm ET to answer your questions, so please ask me anything!\n\n\nPS: I have a new book out August 5th, called “\nComing Up Short: A Memoir of My America\n” – part autobiography, part history focused on why America elected Trump in 2016 and then again in 2024, and part a story of the failure of my generation – that may hold answers to some of the questions I don’t get to today. There is also a new documentary called “\nThe Last Class\n” (in theaters presently) about my aforementioned final semester of teaching my “Wealth and Poverty” class at UC Berkeley, which expounds on the importance of education to democracy, and deep appreciation for all of the students I’ve had the privilege of teaching over the years.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your many thoughtful questions. I'm afraid I must be off, but I look forward to coming back again, though hopefully sooner than last time!", "url": "/r/politics/comments/1m7hzgi/im_robert_reich_former_secretary_of_labor_uc/", "score": 204, "num_comments": 256, "domain": "self.politics", "post_url": "https://reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1m7hzgi/im_robert_reich_former_secretary_of_labor_uc/", "author": "RB_Reich"}
