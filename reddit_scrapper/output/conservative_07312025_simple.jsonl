District Court Chief Judge James E. Boasberg. Two nights ago, we released our 32-page report (pdf file here: \nbit.ly/3U1nGFR\n) anonymously on Twitter (see \nhttps://x.com/WhoaFrankie323/status/1950331460918870035). But\n our anonymity, while helpful in certain aspects, hinders us from gaining wide dissemination of the report and its findings. \n\n\nThe report sets forth a litany of under-reported or never-publicized facts raising serious questions about whether Judge Boasberg breached his ethical obligations by failing to disclose facts (or affirmatively recusing himself) about his immediate family's significant and conflicting financial/professional ties to various Trump 2.0 case plaintiffs and deep biases/subjective motivations hostile to the Trump administration. Every statement of fact is faithfully and scrupulously cited to (usually quoted verbatim from) public records or other reporting sources. The facts stand on their own and our anonymity should not present a reporting/diligence issue as they're all independently verifiable, most of them in multiple ways from multiple sources. \n\n\nWe hope you'll take a look at it and assist us in getting it publicized. We are trying our best to get the report into the hands of the DOJ, because they are presently proceeding with a judicial misconduct complaint (that they filed with the D.C. Circuit Court just this past Monday, 7/28) against Boasberg based on relatively innocuous (relative to the findings in our report, anyway) complaint and factual foundation. \n\n\nDM us if you are interested in helping us get this report publicized, and particularly if you can assist us in getting it into the hands of the litigators at the DOJ. \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hctk9jd748gf1.png?width=1277&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c1658ba41161c350314a0be2460007525ad06db", "url": "/r/Conservative/comments/1me3tj5/dc_judge_james_boasberg_justreleased/", "score": 12, "num_comments": 0, "domain": "self.Conservative", "post_url": "https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1me3tj5/dc_judge_james_boasberg_justreleased/", "author": "Adept-Tax-9691"}
