I have always been able to read off her phone but lately she has been hiding it. I was very worried she was talking to another guy and/or having an affair. \n\n\nYesterday she was using her phone and put it down, went into the bathroom and started to shower. I realized she forgot her phone as lately she would basically hide it when showering. \n\n\nI went through her messages, contacts, calls, etc, and found nothing. No unusual pics, calls or emails. Then I started looking through her apps and saw reddit. She has never mentioned it before. I was terrified she was having an affair but what I found was so much worse.\n\n\nHer reddit account has hundreds of posts and they are all on \nr/Conservative\n! She defends Trump and Republicans! How could she! I can't believe I am married to a nazi. I was heart broken. I was literally shaking! She knows our neighbors and uncles who voted Trumpf all regret it now! I cut off all contact with them but I am sure they regret it!\n\n\nThere was not a single hate post or pedo accusation against Trump. Not one. Not a single post exposing Stephen Miller for being Satan. In fact she was defending them! She didn't even call out Fallon for having Gutfeld on! All her posts were like, \"Trump is doing a good job here but could be better if...\"\n\n\nWTF! How can she humanize Drumpf??!! Orange man is actually worse than Hitler, how could she!! I feel victimized by this betrayal. One post said the Sidney Sweeney ad \"wasn't even a big deal\"! Another post claimed we were \"on the right track\" regarding tariffs when we are certainly heading towards a great depression. This has caused me so much anxiety and mental anguish. She said it wasn't ok to attack federal law enforcement who we all know are terrorist agents of the orange man who is sending people to death camps!!!\n\n\nI packed up my stuff, took our kids and am staying at my mom's. I can't be in the same house as a nazi and my neodivergent, gender fluid 2 year old twins have been very sad about mommy being a racist pedo supporter and Russian agent. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?
