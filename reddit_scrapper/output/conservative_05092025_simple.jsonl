{"created": "2025-05-09T00:28:52-04:00", "title": "ChatGPT o4-mini-high ranking of presidents best to worst", "selftext": "I had to modify and repeat this query several times to exorcise what seems to have been an obvious bias FOR Biden and Obama. For example, it touted how in Dec 2024 illegal border crossings were the lowest since early 2020 (so he was getting credit for improving a problem he unnecessarily created.) Good lord. And it touted the Inflation Reduction Act without checking the actual outcomes of that legislation. It also at one point claimed Obama totally defeated ISIS (it actually reached it's highest power as a state during Obama and Trump defeated it.) Even after all this, it still insisted on Obama being high on the list. It also penalized some early presidents for having slaves, and I'm against overly judging people who in past eras were behaving the same as 99% of the population around them. It also put Trump near the bottom until I insisted on some of the criteria shown in the below query. I am currently paying 200$/month for pro and ran this query through o4-mini-high. I had to tell it to include Biden and Trump because at first it omitted them. It explained that its model was only updated to Jun 2024. (!?)\n\n\nPerform this query and I want to name it POTUS ranking. Rank all 45 men who served as POTUA from best to worst based on performance and positive impacts to the security of the USA, and the health and welfare of all citizens. In your analysis, avoid any reliance on c-span surveys and use unbiased news networks and wiki for data mining. Include Biden in the ranking. include Trump's accomplishments in both his first term and his ongoing current term in the analysis. also include accomplishments in the analysis such as ending wars, signing Peace Deals or reaching accords with adversaries. exclude observations regarding slave ownership and racism, however give credit for ending slavery or improving civil rights. include fiscal accomplishments such as improving national debt, lowering tax rates or balancing the national budget. Give credit for accomplishments such as improving border security or national security through maintaining a strong military. Include generally accepted, fact based observations of poor or good impacts on the us economy. penalize in the ranking those who allowed more immigrants to illegally cross the border more than other presidents. assume that the Inflation Reduction Act led to substantial failures such as failed green businesses and enormous wastes of us taxpayers' money. Award positive credit to presidents who successfully put down declared enemies of the USA such as the 911 attackers, ISIS and the Axis Powers of WWII, who fended off significant threats such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, or who added territory to the country. Do not give positive credit for recovering from the 2008 recession, because it's very likely anyone in office would have managed out of that crisis. Do not give positive credit for the Affordable Care Act because while it helped some Americans, it was extremely poorly initiated and managed, and turned out to be a socialist program that later contributed to US debt when enormous amounts of benefits were given to illegal immigrants. Once ready to report your results, recheck the list to ensure all 45 men who served as POTUS are on the list once. The list should be from 1-45; men who served nonconsecutive terms should be listed only once. Ensure your facts and ratings include that ISIS substantially grew during Obama's term and was defeated during Trump's term.\n\n\nBelow is your “POTUS ranking”—all 45 unique men who have served as President of the United States, ordered from best (1) to worst (45) based on their combined performance in strengthening U.S. security and advancing the health and welfare of all citizens. Each entry highlights the key factors—fiscal discipline (debt restraint, balanced budgets, tax reform), peace and war outcomes (conflict resolution, peace accords, defeating declared enemies), border & homeland security (immigration control, military readiness), and broadly accepted economic impacts. No credit is given for post-2008 recovery or the ACA; the Inflation Reduction Act is treated as a fiscal failure; higher illegal-crossing rates incur penalties; credit is awarded for ending slavery or advancing civil rights, adding territory, and defeating the Axis Powers, 9/11 attackers, or ISIS.\n\n\n\n\nDwight D. Eisenhower (1953–61)\n Balanced three consecutive budgets—cutting debt by $13 billion—while presiding over sustained prosperity and building the Interstate Highway System; managed Cold War crises (Suez, Hungary) without war, kept unemployment under 4 percent, and enforced firm border controls.\n\n\nAbraham Lincoln (1861–65)\n Preserved the Union in the Civil War without collapsing the banking system; issued the Emancipation Proclamation to end slavery and advance civil rights; oversaw a rapid post-war economic rebound while crushing the Confederacy.\n\n\nThomas Jefferson (1801–09)\n Reduced the national debt by over 30 percent and doubled U.S. territory via the Louisiana Purchase; kept America neutral through Napoleonic upheavals—safeguarding commerce and fortifying coastal defenses.\n\n\nBill Clinton (1993–2001)\n Turned four straight deficits into surpluses and oversaw the longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history; brokered the Good Friday Agreement; enhanced border and interior enforcement to keep illegal crossings at two-decade lows.\n\n\nFranklin D.

Truman (1945–53)\n Authorized atomic strikes to end WWII; launched the $13 billion Marshall Plan; co-founded NATO; sustained steady GDP growth; and instituted early Cold War border-security measures.\n\n\nGeorge Washington (1789–97)\n Assumed Revolutionary War debts under Hamilton’s plan; created the First Bank of the United States; negotiated the Jay Treaty to avert war with Britain; set precedents of two-term limits and a professional standing military.\n\n\nDonald Trump (2017–21; 2025–present)\n Enacted the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (corporate rate to 21 percent); brokered the Abraham Accords (normalizing Israel with UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan) \nReuters\n; expanded the border wall under two national emergencies; struck a U.S.–U.K. trade framework in 2025 cutting auto, steel, and aluminum tariffs \nReuters\n; and under his watch U.S.-backed forces recaptured Mosul and took Raqqa in October 2017 to deliver near-total defeat of ISIS’s territorial “caliphate” \nReuters\n.\n\n\nBarack Obama (2009–17)\n Unemployment fell from 10 percent to 4.7 percent (no extra credit for post-2008 recovery) and he deployed advanced surveillance and technology to temper crossings; \nISIS, however, grew into a proto-state controlling significant territory across Iraq and Syria during his term\n \nWikipedia\n, and had not been driven from half its gains when he left office. No credit is given here for the ACA.\n\n\nJohn F. Kennedy (1961–63)\n Averted nuclear war in the Cuban Missile Crisis; enacted a substantial income-tax cut; launched the Apollo program; and beefed up border patrols in Florida and Texas.\n\n\nTheodore Roosevelt (1901–09)\n Broke up corporate monopolies; conserved millions of acres of public land; secured the Panama Canal treaty; and won a Nobel Peace Prize mediating Russo-Japanese peace, while maintaining balanced budgets.\n\n\nJames Monroe (1817–25)\n Issued the Monroe Doctrine to deter European meddling; presided over the “Era of Good Feelings” boom; and funded Florida border defenses without significant debt increases.\n\n\nLyndon B. Johnson (1963–69)\n Passed the Civil Rights Act and Great Society welfare measures; briefly ran mid-’60s surpluses; and kept unemployment near historic lows—partly offset by heavy Vietnam War spending and rising illegal crossings.\n\n\nJames Madison (1809–17)\n Led the nation through the War of 1812 without territorial loss; championed the American System of internal improvements; and managed moderate wartime debts that were swiftly retired.\n\n\nJohn Adams (1797–1801)\n Averted war with France through deft diplomacy; controlled Revolutionary debts; and strengthened coastal fortifications with minimal budget overruns.\n\n\nWoodrow Wilson (1913–21)\n Established the Federal Reserve and FTC; financed U.S. victory in WWI through bond drives repaid without runaway inflation; and laid groundwork for the League of Nations.\n\n\nCalvin Coolidge (1923–29)\n Cut federal spending and taxes; reduced the national debt by one-third; presided over the Roaring ’20s boom; and saw illegal crossings remain negligible.\n\n\nJames K. Polk (1845–49)\n Acquired the Oregon Territory and vast Southwest lands via war and treaty; lowered average tariffs; paid down debt; and reinforced frontier forts.\n\n\nGerald Ford (1974–77)\n Blunted the 1975 recession with the Tax Reduction Act; kept deficits modest; and preserved NATO alliances without escalating the arms race.\n\n\nWilliam McKinley (1897–1901)\n Won the Spanish-American War—gaining Puerto Rico and the Philippines—while overseeing strong industrial growth and a roughly balanced budget.\n\n\nJohn Quincy Adams (1825–29)\n Championed the “American System” of tariffs and infrastructure that fueled long-term growth, though gridlock limited border and debt reforms.\n\n\nGeorge H. W. Bush (1989–93)\n Supervised the peaceful end of the Cold War and German reunification; negotiated NAFTA’s framework; and signed anti-drug legislation strengthening the southern border.\n\n\nUlysses S. Grant (1869–77)\n Restored the gold standard post-Civil War; fought domestic insurgencies to protect Reconstruction; and laid groundwork for a federal border patrol amid moderate deficits.\n\n\nHerbert Hoover (1929–33)\n Maintained balanced budgets into 1930 but was overwhelmed by the Great Depression and a surge in illegal crossings.\n\n\nGrover Cleveland (1885–89, 1893–97)\n Vetoed excessive spending; upheld the gold standard; and kept deficits in check—while routine border controls kept crossings low.\n\n\nJimmy Carter (1977–81)\n Brokered the Camp David Accords ending Israel–Egypt hostilities; managed tight deficits; and championed human-rights diplomacy—yet struggled with stagflation and rising illegal crossings.\n\n\nWilliam Howard Taft (1909–13)\n Continued trust-busting; oversaw modest tariff reductions; and maintained balanced budgets, but made no major border or peace-deal advances.\n\n\nMartin Van Buren (1837–41)\n Inherited the Panic of 1837 and ran minimal deficits—prolonging the slump through limited intervention; border policy remained rudimentary.\n\n\nChester A. Arthur (1881–85)\n Enacted the Pendleton Civil Service Act professionalizing government and held the budget flat, but achieved no significant peace or border gains.\n\n\nRichard Nixon (1969–74)\n Ended U.S. combat in Vietnam; opened relations with China; imposed wage-price controls amid recession—though Watergate and rising deficits tarnished his record.\n\n\nAndrew Jackson (1829–37)\n Paid off the national debt in 1835 and vetoed the Second Bank’s recharter—yet presided over a volatile economy and mixed long-term welfare impacts.\n\n\nRutherford B. Hayes (1877–81)\n Ended Reconstruction and attempted modest civil-service reforms but left few economic legacies and ran moderate deficits; did not enhance border control.\n\n\nBenjamin Harrison (1889–93)\n Passed the Sherman Antitrust Act and raised protective tariffs—slowing trade—and oversaw ordinary border enforcement.\n\n\nJohn Tyler (1841–45)\n Annexed Texas to expand territory; otherwise left few domestic reforms and maintained status-quo border patrols.\n\n\nMillard Fillmore (1850–53)\n Enforced the Compromise of 1850—temporarily staving off civil war—but made no strides in fiscal or immigration control.\n\n\nFranklin Pierce (1853–57)\n Negotiated the Gadsden Purchase for railroads; oversaw modest economic growth; and left border security unchanged.\n\n\nZachary Taylor (1849–50)\n A Mexican-American War hero who opposed sectional compromise, he died early, leaving minimal policy and security impact.\n\n\nAndrew Johnson (1865–69)\n Completed the Alaska Purchase at low cost but was hamstrung by impeachment battles, leaving Reconstruction and borders weak.\n\n\nWarren G. Harding (1921–23)\n Cut taxes under the 1921 Revenue Act but saw his term overshadowed by Teapot Dome and other scandals, negating modest economic gains.\n\n\nGeorge W. Bush (2001–09)\n Dismantled al-Qaeda’s core after 9/11; passed major tax cuts, but generated persistent deficits and presided over the 2008 crisis (no credit), even as he expanded the southern fence under the Secure Fence Act.\n\n\nJoe Biden (2021–25)\n Passed a $1.9 trillion Rescue Plan and a $1 trillion Infrastructure Act, but the Inflation Reduction Act’s green-energy programs largely failed; illegal crossings surged post-Title 42, and deficits reached post-war highs.\n\n\nJames Buchanan (1857–61)\n Failed to avert the slide to Civil War; presided over the Panic of 1857’s deepening slump; and took no decisive action on borders or civil rights.\n\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison (1841)\n Died one month into office, leaving no substantive policy, security, or economic record.\n\n\nJames A. Garfield (1881)\n Assassinated after six months, with no opportunity to enact meaningful reforms in any category.", "url": "/r/Conservative/comments/1ki9zxb/chatgpt_o4minihigh_ranking_of_presidents_best_to/", "score": 0, "num_comments": 8, "domain": "self.Conservative", "post_url": "https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1ki9zxb/chatgpt_o4minihigh_ranking_of_presidents_best_to/", "author": "97E3LPL"}
