They were completely duped just like they said…\n\n\nThey \nstill\n should lose their jobs and their reputations. Fox, OAN, Newsmax, and others were on the Biden cognitive issues from day one, and anyone reporting it was mocked. Anyone who agreed with it was entrenched in “right-wing conspiracy theories.”\n\n\nLook, if the leftist media was genuinely duped, they should be calling conservative media night and day asking them for advice on journalism. They should be asking them for their sources, asking them for the clips they had once called “Cheapfakes.”\n\n\nInstead your average democrat voter says “Oh, well they didn’t know. You can’t blame Jake Tapper and the others because Biden’s staff hid it.”\n\n\nNo, dems, you’re literally missing the point. Your source of information “missed” the biggest coverup in American history. Jump ship and start considering that maybe your conservative friends have a more reliable source of information. \n\n\nThank you for coming to my soapbox.", "url": "/r/Conservative/comments/1kt90qw/with_all_the_talk_about_the_biden_coverup_theres/", "score": 186, "num_comments": 97, "domain": "self.Conservative", "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/1kt90qw/with_all_the_talk_about_the_biden_coverup_theres/", "author": "JaedLDee", "fullname": "t3_1kt90qw", "thumbnail": null}
