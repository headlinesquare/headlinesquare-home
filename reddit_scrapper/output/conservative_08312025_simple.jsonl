I'll never forget working at a consulting firm in DC with a boss who was South-asian ( you all know who I am talking about) who was routinely hiring h1b visa from that country.  Remember this is DC there are a ton of educated people here and great schools and she felt that she couldn't find talent in the area and went out of her way to hire foreigners.  \n\n\nI can even recall here in FL with certain cruise companies doing the same in tech.  I hope that what comes of this is tangible action and reform to the H1B visa hiring practices.  This and ai is absolutely killing the American tech worker industry \n\n\nPersonally speaking,\n1.  Employers should pay h1bs the exact same as an American \n2. Employers should prove that they couldn't find an American to do this exact job. \n3.   They should be capped at how many h1bs they can have.\n4. H1bs should be treated as a contract worker. 1 year max. And that worker should apply somewhere else, this will allow Americans to actually work at these companies.\n\n\nThoughts?  And will any of you report?
