Not a lot of Americans are able or willing to take on this kind of debt, and even if they do, they are being ignored in order for candidates from other countries to instead take their place. The worst part of this, is that people from other countries go to school in their country, often for free, and are able to become doctors here without retaking any classes. \n\n\nThis is not limited to doctors either. The phillipines specifically has American curriculum nursing programs that cost almost nothing, that contracts them to hospitals in America. While American citizens are often taking on 50k+ of debt for the same degree here.\n\n\nImmigration, both legal and illegal, are destroying many fields of advanced study in this country for Americans. No person should be able to come here already one step ahead of a born and raised American citizen.\n\n\nThe influx of these different cultures into these fields is changing the culture of them as a whole, and we are starting to see almost no new doctors that are American born where I live.\n\n\nWhats even worse, is the nepotism. You see this in canada a lot as well, where entire stores have nothing but people from india working in them. My source that told me all of this said her local hospital has almost a dozen people from a small country in the middle east working on one single unit, who all knew each other back home. We are being kicked out of our own country at this point.\n\n\nDEI obviously plays a large part of this, but its only one piece of the puzzle. \n\n\nThe playing field should be equal, and they should have to go to American schools to work American jobs. Their foreign degrees they receive for pennies shouldnt allow them to come here and rake in six figures. Americans do not have the opportunity to attend these same schools.\n\n\nI think more research and discussion needs to be done in regards to the economic impact of allowing foreigners to outcompete Americans on our own soil.", "url": "/r/Conservative/comments/1ly84ol/unfair_advantages_for_immigrants_in_advanced/", "score": 61, "num_comments": 39, "domain": "self.Conservative", "post_url": "https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1ly84ol/unfair_advantages_for_immigrants_in_advanced/", "author": "Material_Candle_5922"}
