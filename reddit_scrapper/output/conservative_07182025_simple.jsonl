It’s about perception. Even if they outnumber conservatives 10 to 1, the appearance of dissent, strength, or momentum on the right is a threat to their dominance. They know ideas spread fast online. If one well-argued conservative post starts gaining traction, they rush to stomp it before it can reach critical mass.\n\n\nGatekeep \"Acceptable\" Opposition\n\nFake “fellow conservatlves” or “former Republicans” help them control what kind of right-wing thought gets visibility. They allow some pushback, but only if it's watered down, critical of the right, or indirectly reinforces left-wing framing. That way, they can claim they're allowing \"debate\" while keeping it confined to their terms.\n\n\nInsecurity in Their Own Positions\n\nYes, even with dominance, there's real ideological insecurity underneath. If they genuinely believed their ideas were sound, there wouldn’t need to suppress or sab0tage dissent. The fact that they do shows a lack of confidence in their ability to win a fair argument.\n\n\nPreemptive Demoralization\n\nThey want you to feel alone, outnumbered, and defeated before you even start typing. If every thread is flooded with negative responses, downv0tes, or fake allies casting doubt, it creates the illusion that your views are fringe. In reality, they’re not. It's a form of psychological manipulation, gaslighting.\n\n\nInstitutionalized Tactics\n\nFor many of them, this isn’t even strategic anymore, It’s cultural. Astr0turfing, brlgadlng, and narrative-sculpting have become normalized behaviors. On Reddlt especially, it’s built into how many activist networks operate. They don’t think they’re being dishonest. They think they’re \"defending democracy\".\n\n\nBeing aware of these tactics will better help with identifying them as they happen and challenging them when possible.", "url": "/r/Conservative/comments/1m3b2o1/why_conservatives_are_targeted_online_a_breakdown/", "score": 11, "num_comments": 30, "domain": "self.Conservative", "post_url": "https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1m3b2o1/why_conservatives_are_targeted_online_a_breakdown/", "author": "According-Activity87"}
