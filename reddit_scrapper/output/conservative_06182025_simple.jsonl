I’ve been stopped by Japanese police \nthree times\n and asked to show my ID. Two of those times, I was in a full suit near the US Embassy, clearly not looking for trouble. The third time, I was just walking with my (Japanese) ex.\n\n\nEach time, I had to hand over my residence card on the spot. Why? Because \nJapanese law requires all foreigners to carry their ID at all times\n (Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act, Article 23). If I didn’t have it, I could be detained, fined, or worse. There’s no debate. No protest. No “that’s discrimination.” It’s the law, and you \nrespect it\n if you want to stay.\n\n\nWhat’s more, Japan doesn’t mess around when it comes to protest. As a noncitizen, if I were to join a public demonstration or speak out against the government too loudly, my \nvisa or permanent residency could be revoked\n. You’re here by permission, not entitlement. That’s how it works.\n\n\nSo when I see people in American cities like LA waving massive Mexican flags during protests, often while demanding changes to US immigration policy, I get pissed off. Not because they’re proud of their heritage. But because I know that \nin most of the world,\n especially places like Japan, foreigners don’t get to do that. Not without serious consequences.\n\n\nAmerica is the only country I’ve lived in where people show up illegally, then demand rights and wave the flag of the country they supposedly left behind. Try that in Japan, China, South Korea, or even most of Europe and see how long you last.\n\n\nIt’s not racist to enforce your border or expect assimilation. It’s \nnormal.\n And if more Americans saw how other countries handle immigration, they’d stop apologizing for having basic standards.", "url": "/r/Conservative/comments/1le8mft/as_an_american_living_in_japan_heres_what_real/", "score": 3955, "num_comments": 467, "domain": "self.Conservative", "post_url": "https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1le8mft/as_an_american_living_in_japan_heres_what_real/", "author": "Stackhouse13"}

One argument I’ve heard and honestly, I understand where it comes from is that a war could actually benefit our military by giving troops real combat experience against a state actor, not just the counterinsurgency stuff we’ve been doing for the past two decades.\n\n\nFor context:\n\n\nI’m retired after over 20 years in the Army. I still have extremely close friends in Special Forces; guys I trust with my life who constantly tell me they’re bored out of their minds and that it’s hard to bring new blood into the SF pipeline because there’s no real war to train for or get tested in. That’s coming straight from the horse’s mouth, not media spin.\n\n\nAnd look, there’s a valid point here:\n\n\n• Combat is the ultimate teacher—no training simulates it perfectly.\n• Facing a capable adversary could harden our military in ways we haven’t seen since early OIF/OEF.\n• It could send a clear message to China, Russia, and every other rival: America hasn’t gone soft.\n\n\n\nHonestly, there’s a point there:\n\n\n• Real war is the ultimate test of our weapons, tactics, and leadership.\n• It would give younger soldiers firsthand combat experience.\n• It could send a strong message to adversaries like China and Russia: we’re not soft, and we’re still top dog.\n\n\n\nBut at the same time, let’s not kid ourselves:\n\n\nWar isn’t a training exercise.\n\n\n“A conflict with Iran could result in the deaths of thousands of American troops and allies within the first week.”\n\n\nSource: CSIS War Game Simulation, 2023\n\n\nhttps://www.csis.org/analysis/us-and-iran-escalation-paths-conflict\n\n\nIran is more than one country\n\n\n“Iran has invested billions into proxy militias across the Middle East, giving it the ability to strike U.S. interests indirectly from Lebanon to Yemen.”\n\n\nSource: RAND Corporation Report on Iranian Influence, 2021\n\n\nhttps://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR4236.html\n\n\nWar could accelerate Iran’s nuclear program\n\n\n“Following the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018, Iran rapidly expanded its enrichment capacity, bringing it closer to weapons-grade levels.”\n\n\nSource: IAEA Quarterly Reports, via Reuters\n\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-enriches-uranium-near-weapons-grade-iaea-says-2023-06-02/\n\n\nWe have smarter options:\n\n\n“Cyber tools like the Stuxnet worm, developed with Israeli cooperation, delayed Iran’s nuclear program without a single shot fired.”\n\n\nSource: Wall Street Journal – How Stuxnet Worked\n\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/how-a-cyberweapon-derailed-irans-nuclear-program-11580439076\n\n\n“Military drills with Israel and Gulf states simulate precision strikes on nuclear sites without committing to full-scale war.”\n\n\nSource: Axios, 2024: U.S. and Israel Conduct Joint Exercises\n\n\nhttps://www.axios.com/2024/01/08/us-israel-military-drill-iran-nuclear\n\n\nAt the end of the day, I’m not saying we never go to war. If Iran crosses a red line, we have to act. But starting a war just to keep our troops sharp? That feels more like neocon cosplay than real conservative policy.\n\n\nEdit: Fixed some formatting.
