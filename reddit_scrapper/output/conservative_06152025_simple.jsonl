I know Trump does something to liberals that makes them more adamant and militant. Has anyone else thought about this? When Biden was doing questionable things in the Executive we did not hit the streets. \n\n\nEdit: based on some the responses and some DM’s I received I think I’d like to clarify that I’m more talking about the liberal vs conservative temperament when it comes to wanting to go out and protest. I know that conservatives have protested - J6 is an example of that - but that was nowhere near the scale of the 2020 protests or yesterdays.
