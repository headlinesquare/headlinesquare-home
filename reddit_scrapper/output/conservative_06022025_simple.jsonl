{"created": "2025-06-02T14:04:56-04:00", "title": "Remember the Archipelago: What Marxism Becomes When It Touches Power", "selftext": "“To each according to his ability, to each according to his need”\n\n\nThis is a statement that exposes the underlying truth of the Marxist-Leninist doctrine.\n \nTo each according to his ability and each according to his need.\n This is one of the foundational pieces for the eventual, inevitable solution. When you enact this “utopian” doctrine into a political system, it becomes coercive by nature.\n\n\nWhat happened in the Soviet Union was not a Stalinist aberration. It was the logical outcome of a doctrine that reduces humans into a means to an end, rather than an end in themselves.\n\n\nIt seems that this subreddit, and the world, needs to be reminded of the Archipelago. We forget all too quickly. And when we forget, anything becomes possible.\n\n\nAfter all, man’s purpose on earth, and in life, is labor, correct? Well, Engels thought so. And hence the justification for the Archipelago.\n\n\nAllow me to share something from the late Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn:\n\n\n“To do evil a human being must first of all believe that what he’s doing is good, or else that it’s a well-considered act in conformity with natural law. Fortunately, it is in the nature of the human being to seek a justification for his actions...\n\n\nIdeology—that is what gives evildoing its long-sought justification and gives the evildoer the necessary steadfastness and determination. That is the social theory which helps to make his acts seem good instead of bad in his own and others’ eyes, so that he won’t hear reproaches and curses but will receive praise and honors.\n\n\nThat was how the agents of the Inquisition fortified their wills: by invoking Christianity; the conquerors of foreign lands, by extolling the grandeur of their Motherland; the colonizers, by civilization; the Nazis, by race; and the Jacobins (early and late), by equality, brotherhood, and the happiness of future generations.\n\n\nThanks to ideology, the twentieth century was fated to experience evildoing on a scale calculated in the millions.”\n\n\nBetween 1918 and 1956, internal repression in the Soviet Union killed between 20 and 66 million people. This was not a malfunction. It was the system functioning as designed—where group identity was prioritized over the individual, and the unimaginable suffering of millions was justified in the name of utopia. Human suffering—reduced to a means to an end.\n\n\nThis is the ideology of Marxism.\n\n\nAnd those who ask—what would motivate a man to work, if there is no reward for his effort?—you are exactly right.\n\n\nHe won’t.\n\n\nAnd here lies the second justification for the Archipelago: the necessary labor for the economic system.\n\n\nAnd so, the prison system—the network of labor camps—was systematized. People were arrested constantly, and this was necessary to fuel the economic engine of the Soviet Union.\n\n\nThe Gulag Archipelago: the system of work camps where these so-called “traitors to the motherland” were meant to be reformed through labor.\n\n\nAfter all, wasn’t labor what reforms man? Isn’t that man’s purpose in the world? \nIsn’t it, Engels? Marx?\n\n\nThese “traitors to the motherland” were no traitors. These were Russia’s own people. Soldiers who fought for the USSR in WWII were imprisoned \nen masse\n when they returned.\n\n\nAnd why?\n\n\nWell, they had been exposed to the West. They could not be allowed to roam free.\n\n\nArticle 58\n was one of the articles used to invoke the title of “political crimes” or a “socially unfriendly element.” In reality, this was an article that was invoked as a general rule—so often that there was a whole class of people created within the system of labor camps: \n“58ers.”\n\n\nThings called \ndirectives\n were issued by the Russian secret police. When a directive came down, there was no need for a trial. The prisoner who sat in the cell would be shipped off to the labor camps without one. After all, he would be found guilty anyway. \nThe paperwork could catch up with the prisoner after he was working\n.\n\n\nAfter all, an acquittal is unthinkable, from an economic view. The humans were the labor force. There would be no acquittals.\n\n\nThe whole point—no acquittals! Why? Because these are economically unfriendly! Don't you know? The fundamental purpose of man, and the only way to reform these savage beasts and criminals, is labor!\n\n\n\n\nDirective of 1943\n – twenty years at hard labor\n\n\nDirective of 1945\n – ten years for everyone, plus five of disenfranchisement\n\n\nDirective of 1949\n – everyone gets 25\n\n\n\n\nThese directives were issued by the machine, because the economic system needed manpower.\n\n\nCoerced labor.\n \nLabor for the Five-Year Plans\n, enacted by Stalin in 1928 onward, in order to rapidly industrialize the Soviet Union.\n\n\nNow, let me leave you with this—\n\n\nThere were very expansive categories within the code of the USSR allowing its citizens to be arrested merely by being part of a family of one individual who was convicted under the code. All the articles of the code became encrusted with interpretations, directions, instructions.\n\n\nAnd if the actions of the accused are not covered by the code, he can still be convicted by \nanalogy\n—simply because of origins (belonging to a socially dangerous milieu), and for contacts with dangerous persons (who is dangerous, and what “contacts” consist of—only the judge can say).\n\n\nBut there was no need for a judge! The directives did the judging. These directives were like executive orders. The machine (the system) stamped out these directives. And again, there was no trial needed.\n\n\nAfter all, delaying this process would be economically unfriendly.\n\n\nIn 1958, the members of the legal profession drafted the new \n“\nFundamental Principles of Criminal Prosecution of the U.S.S.R.\n”\n, and they made a mistake that caused a big scandal.\n\n\nThey had forgotten to provide any reference to possible grounds for acquittal! And why not? It is what they were used to!\n\n\n“Why, in fact, should a trial be supposed to have two possible outcomes when our general elections are conducted on the basis of one candidate? An acquittal is, in fact, unthinkable from the economic point of view.” — \nAleksandr Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag Archipelago\n\n\n“A close reading of 20th century history indicates, as nothing else can, the horrors that accompany loss of faith in the idea of the individual. It is only the individual, after all, who suffers. The group does not suffer. Only those who compose it. Thus the reality of the individual must be regarded as primary, if suffering is to be regarded seriously. Without such regard, there can be no motivation to reduce suffering, and therefore no respite. Instead, the production of individual suffering can, and has, and will be again rationalized and justified for its supposed benefits for the future and the group.” — \nJordan Peterson, New Year’s Letter 2016\n\n\nThe crux of the issue—\n\n\nThere is a principle called the \nPareto distribution\n. This is a sort of natural law. What it states is that \nvery few people end up with almost all of the resources\n. This is the natural consequence of any trading game.\n\n\nLet me demonstrate:\n\n\n\n\nWhen you play Monopoly, what happens at the end? One person ends up with all the money.\n\n\nImagine 100 people are in a room, each with $1, and they all find a partner to flip a coin with. Whoever loses the coin toss gives the other person their dollar. Eventually, one person, again, ends up with all the money.\n\n\n\n\nSo this is a sort of natural law of reality. This is what things tend toward when left on their own.\n\n\nNow, Marxism proposes to eliminate this disparity. Marxism supposes that the state will collectivize, and then fall away when it is not needed anymore. When the revolution is complete.\n\n\nBut the problem remains—\n\n\nIf the Pareto principle is a natural law, \nwhen will the state fade away?\n When will coercion no longer be required by a powerful state? When will the revolution finally defeat its oppressive enemies?\n\n\nThe answer—never.\n\n\nAnd nobody knows what to do about the Pareto principle. I am not proposing a solution here.\n\n\nWhat I will say is that \nhierarchies are natural\n, and will always exist. So we must strive to make those hierarchies \nfair\n, and based on \ncompetence\n instead of power.\n\n\nAnd as Peterson says, the individual identity \nMUST be primary\n, or the precursor to great evil manifests.\n\n\nThe new-age communists, the neo-Marxists, and even the postmodernists are naive to the realities outlined in this essay—for it is not they who must stand on the bones of Marxist ideals. Not yet. For now, it is the Russians who stand on the bones of their fathers—alongside the forgotten millions buried under the regimes of Maoist China, Pol Pot’s Cambodia, Kim’s North Korea, and others who paid the price for utopia with blood.\n\n\nRemember the Archipelago.\n\n\nNote: I was banned for this post in \nr/DebateCommunism\n. Ironically, this is what one would expect!\n\n\n\"To stand up for the truth is nothing!\n\n\nFor truth you have to sit in jail!\"\n\n\n—\n \nAnatoly Ilyich Fastenko, as quoted in\n \nThe Gulag Archipelago", "url": "/r/Conservative/comments/1l1p0we/remember_the_archipelago_what_marxism_becomes/", "score": 7, "num_comments": 0, "domain": "self.Conservative", "post_url": "https://reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1l1p0we/remember_the_archipelago_what_marxism_becomes/", "author": "Witty-Dragonfruit996"}
