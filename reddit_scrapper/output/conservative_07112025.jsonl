And that is only one example of the abuse of our system. Multiply these scenarios times 30-100 million, and youll understand why America doesn't look like it did when you were a kid.\n\n\nI have a lot of insight into immigration, both legal and illegal, and will be posting more discussions regarding such.\n\n\nAmerica's full.", "url": "/r/Conservative/comments/1lxconp/the_amount_and_impact_of_illegals_on_our_country/", "score": 8, "num_comments": 8, "domain": "self.Conservative", "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/1lxconp/the_amount_and_impact_of_illegals_on_our_country/", "author": "Material_Candle_5922", "fullname": "t3_1lxconp", "thumbnail": null}

Is this wise statecraft?", "selftext": "I'm a supporter of the President, but unlike some here, I don't automatically agree with everything he does. I've been cautiously supportive of his tariff policy, but his recent threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports if Brazil's government goes ahead with its prosecution of former President Bolsonaro seems to me to be blatant interference in the internal affairs of another country.\n\n\nI don't even necessarily oppose tariffs over political matters (e.g., his threats of massive tariffs against Colombia when that country's President refused to accept Colombian deportees from America was IMHO entirely appropriate). But in this case, it is purely an internal matter that has nothing to do with the USA. We in America would never tolerate such blatant interference in our internal affairs.\n\n\nTrump seems poised to destroy our trade relationship with a major country simply because he's pals with the former President and therefore doesn't want to see him prosecuted. This is no way to run foreign policy nor trade policy.\n\n\nThoughts?\n\n\nEDIT: As a result of the spirited opposition I've encountered here, I went back and read for the first time the actual posting of the President regarding Brazil. The statement started off with a defense of Bolsonaro, but when it came to the actual threat of 50% sanctions, Trump related them to Brazilian laws targeting Americans and other Brazilian trade policies. Just another example of media corruption twisting a story to fit a narrative. \n\n\nI should have done my due diligence.
