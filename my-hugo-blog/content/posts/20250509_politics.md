### 1.2 Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Operations
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, faces serious criticism over its sweeping cuts.

Impacts include FDA delays in posting food safety warnings [3] and tribal opposition to Fish and Wildlife Service office closures [4].

### 1.3 Constitutional Challenges to Executive Power
Federal courts have imposed significant checks on administration actions. A judge barred the administration from shrinking agencies that fund libraries [1], while another indicated they would likely block the president's plan to fire thousands of federal employees, citing constitutional overreach [2]. Reports indicate Trump is "losing more than he's winning" in court [3].

## 2. Immigration & Border Policies

### 2.1 Enforcement Operations and Refugee Policies
ICE enforcement actions have generated nationwide controversy. A judge ordered the release of Turkish student Rümeysa Öztürk from immigration detention [1], while contentious operations included confrontations with families [2] and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka's arrest while protesting an ICE detention center [3]. White House adviser Stephen Miller reportedly stated the administration is "actively looking at" suspending habeas corpus for deportations [4]. Simultaneously, Trump officials are bringing white Afrikaner refugees from South Africa to the U.S. [5], while other refugee programs remain paused [6].

## 3. Economic Policy & International Trade

### 3.1 Tariffs and Global Trade
President Trump has suggested an 80% tariff on Chinese imports [1] while delegating final decisions to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent [2]. The administration confirmed that a baseline 10% tariff will remain permanent [3] and identified approximately 20 priority economies for trade negotiations [4]. The U.S.-UK trade deal reducing tariffs on cars and metals [5] has generated criticism from American automakers [6]. Economic impacts are mounting: China's exports to the U.S. have dropped 20% [7], businesses are labeling tariff costs on receipts [8], and consumers face higher prices on products ranging from vehicles to baby items [9].

The Treasury Department warned the nation will likely reach its debt limit "X-date" in August [1], with Treasury Secretary Bessent advising Congress to raise the debt limit by July to prevent a default [2]. On taxation, President Trump has sent mixed signals – stating Republicans should "probably not" raise taxes on wealthy Americans [3] while also reportedly instructing Congress to include higher taxes on wealthy Americans in budget legislation [4].

The Pentagon began removing transgender service members from the military [1] and directed military libraries to "pull books that address diversity, anti-racism, gender issues" [2]. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to create an autism database using Medicare and Medicaid information [3]. Proposed Medicaid cuts could cause 700,000 Michigan residents to lose health insurance [4], threatening Republican efforts to advance what's described as Trump's "big, beautiful bill" [5].
