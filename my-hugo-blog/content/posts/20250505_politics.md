## 1. Executive Authority and Constitutional Questions

### 1.1 Presidential Power Expansion

President Trump has made statements raising fundamental questions about constitutional authority. When asked if he must uphold constitutional due process, Trump reportedly said "I don't know" [1]. Despite these concerns, he has explicitly stated he won't seek a third term, saying "I'll be an eight-year president" [2]. Senior adviser Stephen Miller has presented what critics describe as a "totally made up definition" of constitutional due process protections [3].

The president has directed the Bureau of Prisons to reopen and expand Alcatraz prison [4], specifying it would house the country's "most ruthless" offenders [5]. The administration is considering labeling some suspected cartel and gang members inside the United States as "enemy combatants" [6] and has introduced a financial incentive program offering $1,000 to undocumented immigrants who voluntarily leave the country [7].

### 1.2 Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, faces scrutiny over its effectiveness. Reports indicate that despite workforce reductions, savings are minimal and offset by degraded government services [1]. Questions have emerged about DOGE's actual purpose beyond cost-cutting [2]. Musk has stated that he and Trump are aligned "80% of the time" [3]. House Democrats have launched an investigation into Musk's potential conflicts of interest [4].

## 2. Economic and Trade Policy

### 2.1 Tariffs and International Response

President Trump has announced a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the United States [1], an unprecedented move targeting the entertainment industry. Reports indicate actor Jon Voight met with Trump before the proposal was announced [2]. The White House states "no final decisions" have been made [3]. UK concerns have emerged that such tariffs could "wipe out" their film industry [4].

Beyond film, Trump has expanded tariffs to include small packages from China [5] and suggested tariffs on dolls, stating U.S. girls "could be very happy with lots fewer dolls" under new tariffs [6]. Chinese exporters are reportedly circumventing Trump's tariffs by routing products through third countries [7]. These policies have triggered significant international backlash, with European consumers boycotting American brands [8] and a Canadian boycott reportedly "ravaging" U.S. border towns [9].

### 2.2 Economic Impact and Financial Services

Economic analyses warn of challenges arising from current policies. The Washington Post reports that Trump's trade war and interest rates are weighing on housing and the broader economy [1]. Some analysts warn that current policies could "make Americans permanently poorer" [2], while others have published guidance on preparing for what they term a "Trumpcession" [3]. The global economy is "already feeling drag from Trump tariffs" [4].

Student loan collections officially restarted on May 5, affecting more than 5 million borrowers in default [5], with the administration reportedly preparing to implement wage garnishment [6]. Social Security has reduced its benefit clawback rate from 100% to 50% for certain beneficiaries, although experts still warn of "devastating" effects [7].

Foreign policy analysts are advocating that "Trump Should Rein In Taiwan" [3], suggesting concerns about U.S.-Taiwan relations.

Israeli officials have indicated plans to "occupy and flatten all of Gaza" if no deal is reached before President Trump's upcoming visit [4]. Tensions with Iran are escalating, with Netanyahu reportedly pushing for military action while Trump holds back [5].

Kennedy Jr.'s "MAHA" (Make America Healthy Again) movement is expanding across multiple states [3], while advocates have rejected his proposal for a national autism database, describing it as "a slippery slope to eugenics" [4]. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is "ending door-to-door canvassing in disaster areas" [5], potentially altering how disaster victims access relief services.
