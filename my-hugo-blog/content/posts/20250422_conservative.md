## 1. Executive Branch Actions

### 1.1 State Department Reorganization and Personnel Changes

The Trump administration has launched what officials describe as the "biggest shake-up in decades" at the State Department, shuttering more than 130 offices and implementing significant staff reductions [1][2]. These changes align with the broader efficiency agenda driven by the Department of Government Efficiency under Elon Musk's leadership.

In a military personnel incident, Army commander Col. Sheyla Baez Ramirez was suspended after photos of President Trump, Defense Secretary Vance, and VA Secretary Hegseth disappeared from a command board [3][4]. The President has maintained public appearances, participating in the White House Easter Egg Roll where he joked that the Easter Bunny was "not taking Trump out" [5], while his EPA Chief confronted media outlets during a press conference characterized as "fiery" [6].
