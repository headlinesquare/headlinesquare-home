## 1. Trump Administration and Executive Branch

### 1.1 Personnel and Staffing  
The Trump administration is breaking modern presidential records with unprecedented staffing efforts, hiring "thousands of America-First warriors" [1]. This staffing approach markedly differs from Trump's first term, with the Chief of Staff implementing a notably aggressive strategy [2]. The administration's focus on loyal personnel suggests a coordinated effort to rapidly advance its agenda.
