## 1. Trump Administration Policies

### 1.1 Executive Actions
The Trump administration has issued an executive order eliminating disparate-impact theory, which advocates describe as restoring the 1964 Civil Rights Act to its original meaning and promoting meritocracy [1] [2]. This represents one of the administration's most significant policy shifts, fundamentally changing federal civil rights enforcement.
