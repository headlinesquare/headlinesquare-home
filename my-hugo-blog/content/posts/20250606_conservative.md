## 1. Trump Administration And Executive Branch

### 1.1 Trump-Musk Relationship And Conflict

A significant public rift has emerged between President Trump and Elon Musk following Musk's departure from DOGE. Polling shows Republicans overwhelmingly supporting Trump (71%) over Musk (6%) [1]. Trump has declined Musk's meeting request and is reportedly considering selling his Tesla [2], describing Musk as "the man who lost his mind" [3].

Despite the tension, Trump's aides have scheduled a call with Musk for Friday [4], and Musk has acknowledged they should "make peace" for the country's benefit [5]. The dispute has provoked extreme reactions from Trump allies, with former White House advisor Steve Bannon calling for Musk's deportation and SpaceX seizure [6].

White House sources have revealed details about what they term a "Big Beautiful Breakup" and Musk's "final straw" [7]. The conflict involves claims about Trump's connections to Jeffrey Epstein, with Musk's AI chatbot Grok contradicting Musk's allegations by stating there's "no indication of wrongdoing" [8].
