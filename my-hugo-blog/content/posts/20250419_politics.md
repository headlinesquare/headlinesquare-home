## 1. Executive Branch Authority and Actions

### 1.1 Federal Workforce Restructuring
President Trump has moved to invoke "Schedule F," a classification that would remove civil service protections from thousands of federal workers [1]. This executive action would reclassify "wide swaths" of the federal workforce [2], making it easier to fire career employees. The Department of Defense is experiencing significant upheaval, with Secretary Hegseth removing four staffers in a single day [3].

### 1.2 DOGE Operations and Agency Changes
House Democrats have raised concerns that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is building a "master database" of Americans' sensitive information [1]. A DOGE representative has reportedly verbally abused federal workers on a 36-hour shift [2]. Personnel changes continue across agencies, with the Kennedy Center firing more staff [3] and the National Security Council being rebuilt with aides aligned with what CBS describes as the "MAGA agenda" [4].

## 2. Judicial System and Legal Challenges

### 2.1 Supreme Court Interventions
The Supreme Court has temporarily halted deportations of Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act [1] [2], marking a significant judicial check on the administration's use of this 18th century wartime law. The administration responded by characterizing the litigation as "meritless" [3]. The Court is also set to hear challenges to the Affordable Care Act's preventive care mandate [4] and arguments on Trump's attempt to reinterpret the 14th Amendment regarding birthright citizenship [5].
