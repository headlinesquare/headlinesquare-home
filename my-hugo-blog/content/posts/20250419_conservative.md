## 1. Immigration and Border Security

### 1.1 Deportation Policies and Legal Challenges
The Supreme Court has ordered a temporary halt to deportations under the 18th century Alien Enemies Act, specifically blocking the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan migrants [1][2]. This follows Federal Judge James Boasberg's earlier denial of an emergency request to block "imminent" deportation flights under the same act [3]. SCOTUS specifically blocked deportation of alleged Tren De Aragua gang members [4]. In a parallel development, a Biden-appointed judge blocked Trump's plan for rapid third-country deportations [5].

Vice President JD Vance discussed migration during a Vatican meeting, described as an "exchange of opinions" with top officials [1][2]. California legislators have introduced a bill that would prioritize illegal immigrants for disaster aid [3]. The deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia has become particularly contentious, with Senator Chris Van Hollen denying that he or other Democratic lawmakers drank margaritas with Garcia during their El Salvador visit [4]. Oversight Chair James Comer criticized Democratic representatives for seeking taxpayer-funded trips to visit the deportee [5].

An MS-13 member and Honduran national was sentenced to 147 months in federal prison for kidnapping a former federal witness at gunpoint in Nashville [4].
