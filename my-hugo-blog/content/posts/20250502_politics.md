## 2. Economic Policy and Budget

### 2.1 Tariffs and Trade Impacts
The administration's tariff policies are disrupting supply chains with the expiration of the "de minimis exemption" imposing tariffs on millions of Americans' purchases [1][2]. U.S. ports experience slowdowns described as "a warning of rough economic seas ahead" [3], while factories needing Chinese machinery remain in limbo [4]. Apple reports difficulty predicting tariff costs, having already relocated half of iPhone production to India [5]. Business responses vary—companies are withdrawing financial guidance amid uncertainty [6] and raising prices [7], with auto workers welcoming tariffs despite Wall Street concerns [8].

### 2.2 Budget Cuts and Economic Outlook
The Trump administration has proposed $163 billion in non-defense spending cuts [1], with House Republicans working to implement $1.5 trillion in reductions [2]. The 2026 budget targets health, education, and clean energy programs while boosting military funding [3], eliminates disaster relief promised to rural communities [4], and reduces EPA staffing to 1980s levels [5]. Despite these cuts, April's jobs report showed 177,000 jobs added [6], though economists report a 75% probability of recession [7]. Trump has called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates [8].

## 3. Judiciary and Civil Rights

### 3.1 Judicial Independence and Legal Challenges
A Republican legislative proposal threatens to undermine judges' ability to hold the Trump administration in contempt [1]. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson has publicly criticized Trump's attacks on judges as "attacks on our democracy" [2], while judges who ruled against Trump have seen their families targeted [3]. Trump allies have sued Chief Justice Roberts in an attempt "to give White House control of court system" [4], while a federal judge ruled the President's application of the Alien Enemies Act to target gangs "unlawful" [5]. Harvard has hired conservative lawyers to fight the administration's threat to its tax-exempt status [6].

Trump has established a religious liberty commission [2], explicitly stating that America should "forget about" separation of church and state [3]. Reports indicate "U.S. press freedom falls to historical low" [4], with allegations that FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr is "turning the FCC into MAGA's censoring machine" [5]. The Department of Justice has terminated a longstanding Civil Rights-era school desegregation order in Louisiana [6] and sent threatening letters to medical journals [7].

## 4. Science, Health and Immigration

### 4.1 Research Funding and Health Policy
Science and research programs face significant cuts. The National Science Foundation has stopped awarding new grants [1] while Trump's budget proposal includes "crippling cuts for science" [2]. An email mistake revealed plans to end research on child safety net programs [3]. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced placebo-trial testing for "all new vaccines" [4] and reportedly "rejects cornerstone of health science: Germ theory" [5]. Congressional Republicans are pursuing "controversial Medicaid changes" [6], while Tennessee has enacted a law allowing healthcare providers to deny care that conflicts with their conscience [7].
