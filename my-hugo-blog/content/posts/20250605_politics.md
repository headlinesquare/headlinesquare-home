## 1. Immigration and Border Policies

### 1.1 Travel Ban Implementation

President Trump has implemented a sweeping travel ban affecting 19 countries – complete restrictions on 12 nations and partial limitations on seven others, scheduled to take effect Monday. The Washington Post identifies Afghanistan, Haiti and Sudan among the affected countries, describing it as a "reinstated travel ban" [1]. 

Governments worldwide are "scrambling to understand" the ban's implications before implementation [2]. A GOP Senator has reportedly contradicted Trump's justification, stating that a Colorado terror attack "isn't the reason" for the ban despite Trump using it as an example [3].

The State Department has implemented enhanced vetting requirements, stating any foreigner seeking to visit Harvard must be vetted for "hostile attitudes towards US culture" [3]. Harvard has filed a legal challenge over the ban on US entry for incoming foreign students [4].

## 2. Trump-Musk Relationship

### 2.1 Public Feud and Economic Consequences

The conflict has escalated to threats, with AP News reporting "Trump threatens to cut Musk's government contracts as their public feud escalates" [3].

### 2.2 Political Implications

The deterioration of this relationship may have broader political implications. Musk has floated the idea of a third party, potentially threatening GOP support [1]. Some Democrats have suggested courting Musk following the break with Trump, seeing a strategic opportunity [2].

The situation has prompted extreme reactions from Trump allies, with Steve Bannon calling for Musk's deportation, claiming he is "an illegal alien" [3].

GOP leaders are "scrambling to save the megabill" in light of Musk's criticisms [3]. Even Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has indicated she plans to vote against it, signaling significant divisions within the Republican Party [4].

Some diplomatic engagement on trade issues appears to be developing, with Trump announcing that the US and China will resume trade talks following a call with President Xi [3].
