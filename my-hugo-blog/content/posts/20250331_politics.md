## 1. EXECUTIVE BRANCH AUTHORITY & GOVERNANCE

### 1.1 Presidential Powers & Term Limit Discussions
President Trump has explicitly stated he is "not joking" about seeking a third term [1], directly challenging the 22nd Amendment's two-term limit. Legal experts warn such actions would throw the country "into chaos" [2], while critics characterize these statements as behavior typical of "dictators" [3]. Congressional Republicans appear to be downplaying these statements, with at least one Republican lawmaker insisting Trump "wasn't advocating" for a third term [4].

### 1.2 DOGE Operations and Musk's Dual Roles
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has accessed the federal payroll system despite objections from career IT officials, who were subsequently placed on leave and under investigation [1]. A DOGE staffer who previously shared Treasury Department data now has expanded access to government systems [2]. While leading DOGE, Musk claimed his government role is "costing me a lot" [3] while simultaneously stating that public backlash against DOGE's cuts is negatively affecting Tesla stock [4]. DOGE's actions have disrupted Social Security service delivery [5].

A new FDA commissioner has ousted a top vaccine regulator after a private swearing-in ceremony [3]. On internal communications, the White House has declared the Signal group chat review "case closed" [4], despite growing Republican calls for investigation into Trump officials' Signal chat usage [5].

## 2. ECONOMIC POLICY & MARKET IMPACTS

### 2.1 Tariff Implementation & Global Reactions
President Trump is implementing sweeping tariff policies set to take effect on April 2, described as "Liberation Day," which will "start with all countries" [1].

China, Japan, and South Korea plan to jointly respond to U.S. tariffs [4], while Canada has implemented "Buy Canadian" practices turning away U.S. products [5]. The White House is considering providing financial assistance to affected farmers [6].

Financial markets have reacted sharply to the tariff announcements, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq falling to six-month lows [1] and stocks marking their worst month in years [2]. Goldman Sachs has revised its U.S. recession probability upward from 20% to 35% [3], while first-quarter GDP growth is projected at just 0.3% as tariffs contribute to stagflation conditions [4]. Consumer confidence about the future has reached a 12-year low, prompting companies to lower earnings forecasts [5]. The president has insisted the "Economy Not About to Explode" despite warnings from banks [6].
