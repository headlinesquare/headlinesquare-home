The administration claims $7 trillion in investment flowing to the US [4], and reports suggest Trump has "outmaneuvered markets, allies, and China" [5]. Stock markets appear to be recovering according to conservative sources [6].

New York City Mayor Adams has reversed the city's previous sanctuary policy by restoring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) presence at Rikers Island [1]. A federal judge ruled that every illegal migrant in the US must register with the federal government [2], and conservative opinion argues that instead of reforming the asylum system, it should be abolished [3]. The Department of Justice has also requested the dismissal of a Virginia case against a Salvadoran accused MS-13 leader who is "set to be deported" [4].

## 4. Trump Administration Governance

### 4.1 Executive Orders and Policy Implementation
President Trump has issued several executive orders addressing various issues. These include actions targeting "risks from Chris Krebs and Government Censorship" [1], ending union dues collection for most federal employees without notice [2], and the move to "shut down" what the administration has termed the government's "Climate Doom Factory" [3]. Additionally, Trump reversed Obama-Biden era regulations on showerhead water flow—calling the previous rule "dumb" [4]—and, amid resistance from blue states, the administration faces challenges over its DEI policies in schools [5]. Critics have characterized the administration's tactics as following a "Provocation Principle" by relying on shock and intimidation [6].

### 5.1 Legislative Challenges and House Actions

In response, the House passed Trump-backed legislation designed to prevent "rogue judges" from halting presidential executive actions [2]. In addition, a major bill aimed at preventing non-citizens from voting in federal elections was passed [3], and internal GOP divisions were overcome to move forward with Trump's "big, beautiful" legislative package [4].

Furthermore, a defamation settlement between NBC and a Georgia doctor has been finalized following MSNBC's controversial "'uterus collector' coverage" [3].

Education policy controversies continue as reports emerge that "Qatar's Grip on Education Is Causing an Explosion of Campus Antisemitism" [1], while California libraries have been reported to stock "free condoms, lube and sex ed materials in stock for all ages" courtesy of Planned Parenthood [2]. In another education-related incident, a Florida teacher reportedly lost their job for using a student's "preferred" name, citing state law that requires parental permission [3].
