## 1. Constitutional & Executive Power

### 1.1 Constitutional Rights & Legal Challenges

President Trump is reportedly considering suspending habeas corpus, a fundamental legal protection preventing indefinite detention without trial [1]. Time magazine has published an analysis of how this constitutional protection is "under threat" [2], while Senator Barrasso stated he doesn't believe a suggested suspension will "come to Congress" [3]. The Supreme Court is currently hearing arguments on birthright citizenship in a case that tests the Court's willingness to constrain executive actions [4].

### 1.2 Ethics and Governance

Multiple news outlets report that the Trump administration plans to accept a luxury jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One [1][2], though Qatar has called these reports "inaccurate" [3]. A House Committee has launched an investigation into allegations that a politically connected startup received preferential treatment from a federal agency [4]. President Trump has also fired the director of the U.S. Copyright Office shortly after a report questioned whether AI training constitutes fair use [5].

### 1.3 Government Restructuring & Doge Operations

Despite cuts implemented by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), federal spending has increased by $166 billion compared to the previous year [1]. A U.S. judge has temporarily halted Trump's drastic cuts to federal agencies [2]. DOGE and HHS Secretary RFK Jr. have gutted legally required offices within federal agencies [3], actions that now face potential judicial reversal. Elon Musk, who heads DOGE, appears to be benefiting as his "regulatory troubles have begun to melt away" [4].

## 2. International Relations & Foreign Policy

### 2.1 Us-China Relations

Recent Geneva talks between the US and China resulted in what President Trump characterized as a "total reset" in bilateral relations [1], with officials reaching an agreement to reduce the trade deficit [2]. The negotiations focused primarily on tariff discussions as the administration attempts to reframe relations between the world's two largest economies, with officials reportedly achieving "substantial progress" [3].

### 2.2 Middle East Policy

President Trump is scheduled to visit Middle Eastern Gulf allies with a focus on trade and investment opportunities [1], while pursuing a $1 trillion investment and attempting to broker Saudi ties to Israel [2]. The trip to Saudi Arabia raises the prospect of U.S. nuclear cooperation with the kingdom [3], signaling a potential major shift in nuclear proliferation policy. Tensions between Trump and Netanyahu have emerged over disagreements on Iran and Gaza [4], while critics suggest Gulf states may be dictating U.S. foreign policy rather than Trump shaping the region [5].

### 2.3 Russia-Ukraine Conflict

After three years of war, Russian President Putin has proposed direct peace talks with Ukraine [1], with President Trump demanding Ukraine hold direct talks with Russia [2]. In response, Ukrainian President Zelensky has offered to meet with President Putin [3]. Secretary of State Marco Rubio plans to visit Turkey to advance renewed peace talks potentially hosted in Istanbul [4], though U.S. and European leaders have rejected Russia's proposal for negotiations without a ceasefire first [5].

## 3. Economic & Trade Policy

### 3.1 Tariff Implementation & Impacts

President Trump's trade policies are creating widespread economic effects, with Howard Lutnick stating that 10% baseline tariffs are "here to stay" [1]. Critics have raised significant concerns, with Citadel CEO Ken Griffin warning that the tariffs create conditions for "crony capitalism" [2]. Small businesses are reporting severe difficulties adapting to the new tariff regime [3], while Chinese manufacturers are actively relocating production to Vietnam to circumvent tariffs [4]. A Wall Street Journal report indicates an "obscure New York court" will rule on the legality of Trump's tariff policies [5].

## 4. Immigration & Border Security

### 4.1 Ice Operations & Enforcement

A confrontation at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility resulted in the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, with body camera footage now public [1][2].

Senator Murphy has directly confronted Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, declaring her "department is out of control" [4].

## 5. Healthcare & Public Health

Public health workers have warned that cuts to health programs have created a "real danger" regarding disease outbreak responses [1], as U.S. measles cases have reportedly reached 1,000 [2]. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. continues promoting anti-vaccination theories despite the surge in cases [3], and experts have characterized his plan to find autism's cause as "unrealistic" [4].
