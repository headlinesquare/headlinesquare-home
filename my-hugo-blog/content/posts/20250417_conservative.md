## 1. Immigration and Border Security

### 1.1 High-Profile Deportation Cases  
The deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador has become a major political flashpoint. A Democratic senator traveled to El Salvador to visit him in prison but was denied access [1], yet pledged to continue "fighting for the return" of the deportee [2]. DHS has released what it calls "hard evidence" supporting Garcia's alleged MS-13 ties [3], while police records characterize him as a "violent" repeat domestic abuser [4]. Media coverage has been criticized, with police records reportedly undermining characterizations of him as being "wrongly deported" [5]. Garcia was previously detained during a 2022 traffic stop on suspicion of human trafficking [6]. The White House has questioned Senator Van Hollen's advocacy for Garcia [7].

### 1.2 Border Enforcement Actions  
The Trump administration has designated land along the U.S.-Mexico border as a military installation, allowing soldiers to directly apprehend migrants crossing the border [1]. President Trump has signed a directive aimed at preventing illegal immigrants from receiving Social Security payments [2]. In a separate case, a Columbia University activist in ICE custody who allegedly endorsed the October 7 attack has received fundraising support from Ilhan Omar's daughter [3]. An El Salvadoran immigrant has been identified as Rachel Morin's killer, described as a "mom of 5" [4], with major networks CNN and MSNBC criticized for not covering an appearance by Morin's mother at the White House [5].

## 2. Trump Administration Policies

### 2.1 Economic and Trade Initiatives  
A new study about the IRS has revealed significant tax savings from Trump tax cuts, particularly benefiting Americans earning less than $75,000 [1]. The administration's tariff policies have drawn both criticism and support, with defenders arguing they are necessary to protect American interests against globalism [2]. President Trump has stated he is in "no rush" to end tariffs during a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Meloni [3]. In response to these policies, Nissan has announced plans to maximize its U.S. production [4], while Chinese small businesses have reportedly put U.S. orders on hold [5]. Trump has also met with a Japanese trade delegation and reported "big progress" [6].

### 2.2 Federal Agency Reforms  
Significant changes are underway in federal agencies. Reports indicate one in five IRS employees are resigning [1]. Secretary of State Rubio has announced the closure of the State Department's Global Engagement Center (GEC), described as a "censorship program" that the Biden administration had previously claimed was ended [2][3]. Some conservatives have expressed alarm over the administration's implementation of REAL ID, characterizing it as "mass surveillance" [4]. The administration has appointed to lead the IRS an agent who allegedly exposed federal efforts to cover up investigations related to the Biden family [5] and reportedly "outmaneuvered" Senate Majority Leader Schumer on the selection of a top federal prosecutor [6].

### 2.3 Budget Reallocation  
Republicans are moving to reallocate $2 billion from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) toward housing for veterans [1], indicating a shift in funding priorities from international aid to domestic veterans' services. President Trump has announced that a minerals deal with Ukraine will be signed next Thursday [2].

## 3. Legal and Justice System

### 3.1 Federal Court Cases  
The Supreme Court is set to hear a case concerning Trump's birthright citizenship policies, focusing on nationwide injunctions [1]. The Trump DOJ has asked an appeals court to review Judge Boasberg's contempt threat [2]. In the Garcia case, an appeals court denied a DOJ bid to block his return from El Salvador [3], with the Fourth Circuit Court criticized for "wearing emotion on the sleeves of their robes" in rejecting a motion to stay [4]. In an antitrust ruling, a judge determined Google operates illegal ad monopolies that "substantially harmed" customers [5].

In a separate case, child killer Thomas Sanders, whose sentence was previously commuted by President Biden, now faces the death penalty in Louisiana [3]. Political violence was reported with the Albany Republican Headquarters being vandalized with swastikas [4], and police are investigating a suspected arson attempt in Pennsylvania potentially motivated by the war in Gaza [5].

The Trump administration has asked the IRS to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status [2], with reports indicating the IRS is making plans to do so [3]. These actions have prompted speculation about Harvard potentially adopting a funding model similar to Hillsdale College, which operates without federal funding [4].
