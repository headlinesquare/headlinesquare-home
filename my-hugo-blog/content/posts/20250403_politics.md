## Area 1: TRADE AND ECONOMIC POLICY

### Topic 1.1: Tariff Implementation and Structure
The Trump administration's sweeping tariffs have shown peculiar implementation patterns. Russia was conspicuously absent from the countries subject to tariffs [1], while uninhabited territories were oddly included [2]. The formula for calculating tariffs has been revealed to be based on trade deficits rather than reciprocal rates [3]. The administration has also ended de minimis treatment for goods from China and Hong Kong [4].

### Topic 1.2: Economic and Market Impacts
Markets have reacted severely to the tariff announcements, with U.S. stock markets experiencing their worst one-day drop since COVID-19 [1]. Markets lost approximately $3.1 trillion in value [2], while billionaires collectively lost around $208 billion in a single day [3]. The real-world economic impacts are already materializing, with Ford offering employee pricing to all shoppers [4] and Stellantis announcing temporary layoffs of 900 U.S. workers [5].

Economic experts warn these tariffs are the highest in decades [6] and could potentially backfire by design. Estimates suggest the average American family could face $3,800 in additional costs [7].

### Topic 1.3: International Responses and Congressional Opposition
Global reactions have been swift and largely retaliatory. Canada announced plans to impose matching 25% tariffs on U.S. automobiles [1], while France's President Macron called on EU companies to freeze investments in the United States [2]. China has urged the U.S. to "immediately" cancel the reciprocal tariffs while vowing counter-measures [3].

The tariffs have revealed significant fractures within the Republican Party. Several Senate Republicans have broken with the administration, including Senator Ted Cruz who admitted "tariffs are a tax on Americans" [4]. Former Vice President Mike Pence called the tariffs the "largest peacetime tax hike in U.S. history" [5]. Some GOP lawmakers have already voted with Democrats to cancel tariffs on Canada [6], with senators now seeking legislation to transfer tariff authority from the executive branch to Congress [7].

## AREA 2: EXECUTIVE BRANCH OPERATIONS

### Topic 2.1: White House Staffing Changes and Federal Workforce Reductions
The White House has terminated multiple National Security Council (NSC) officials following a meeting between President Trump and far-right activist Laura Loomer. Reports indicate that between three and six NSC aides were dismissed [1], with Loomer reportedly "pushing for ousters" during her Oval Office visit [2].

Elon Musk's formal White House role is ending, according to multiple reports [3]. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Musk, has initiated substantial federal workforce reductions, with layoffs spiking by 205% last month to the "third-highest ever recorded" [4]. Senator Bernie Sanders warned that 67,000 people could die awaiting benefits under Musk-directed cuts to the Social Security Administration [5].

## AREA 3: NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY

### Topic 3.1: Pentagon Investigations and Diplomatic Developments
The Pentagon's Inspector General has launched a formal investigation into Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's use of the encrypted messaging app Signal for military operations [1]. The probe specifically focuses on Hegseth's communications regarding a Houthi strike [2], with the Defense Secretary also reportedly expected to skip a key meeting with allies focused on Ukraine support [3].

The Trump administration has lifted sanctions on the wife of Boris Rotenberg, a known ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin [4]. The U.S. military has implemented a policy banning sexual relations between American personnel and Chinese citizens while in China [5], and the U.S. has canceled the visa of former Costa Rican president and Nobel Peace Prize winner Oscar Arias [6].

## AREA 4: IMMIGRATION AND BORDER SECURITY

### Topic 4.1: Deportation Policies and Legal Challenges
The administration's deportation practices face significant legal scrutiny. Judge Boasberg is set to determine whether Trump deportation flights have defied existing court orders [1], and another judge is considering holding Trump officials in contempt for allegedly defying court orders blocking deportation flights to El Salvador specifically [2].

Immigration enforcement has intensified, with immigration officials raiding a Washington state roofing company and arresting over three dozen people [3]. Individual visa revocations have increased, with Temple University reporting a student's visa revoked "at the discretion of the Secretary of State" [4].

Kennedy Jr. has cut laboratories specifically tasked with investigating outbreaks of sexually transmitted diseases and hepatitis [2]. Meanwhile, the National Institutes of Health has rescinded its Scientific Integrity Policy [3].

The legal environment for transgender individuals has deteriorated, with multiple countries issuing travel advisories for transgender people traveling to the United States [4]. The Department of Education has issued warnings to schools that they must eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs or risk losing federal funding [5], while libraries across the country face operational challenges as Trump administration budget cuts have put these "community hubs in peril" [6].

The US health secretary and agency are being sued by 23 states and DC over an $11 billion funding cut [2]. The Intercept reports Trump "just pardoned... a corporation?" [3], potentially expanding presidential pardon power in novel ways.

Congressional Republicans are debating significant tax changes, including possibly increasing the top tax rate to 40% for millionaires [4]. Meanwhile, several notable political figures are making significant campaign moves. NYC Mayor Eric Adams has announced he will skip the Democratic primary and run for reelection as an independent [5], while Democratic performance is reportedly improving in special elections [6].
