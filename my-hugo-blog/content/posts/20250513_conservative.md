## 1. Trump Administration & Executive Actions

### 1.1 Middle East Diplomacy & Presidential Trip
President Trump's Middle East tour has focused on securing economic partnerships, particularly with Saudi Arabia. Trump has established a new "strategic" partnership with Saudi Arabia [1] and signed an economic deal valued at $600 billion with the Saudi Crown Prince [2]. The visit has included meetings with prominent American CEOs including Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and Larry Fink at the Saudi royal court [3]. A notable achievement during the trip is the release of Hamas hostage Edan Alexander, creating what officials describe as a "window of opportunity" for broader hostage agreements [4]. In his Middle East address, President Trump explicitly condemned "interventionalists" while articulating his vision for "a more hopeful future" in the region [5].

Controversy has emerged over Qatar's reported gift of a Boeing 747 aircraft valued at approximately $400 million to the U.S., which Trump has defended as part of a "long history of unusual presidential presents" [6].
