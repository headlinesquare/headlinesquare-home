## 1. Trump Administration's First 100 Days

### 1.1 Performance Assessment and Public Opinion

President Trump's first 100 days have generated predominantly negative polling data. Only 39% approve of his economic handling [1], while most Americans view him as "a dangerous dictator" [2]. His popularity has hit "historic lows" [3], with a significant plurality assigning him an "F" gradeâ€”more than any other grade [4]. Financial markets are experiencing their worst 100-day start since Nixon due to "semi-permanent uncertainty" [5].

The President has rejected negative polling as "FAKE" [6] while claiming "I Run the Country and the World" [7]. The Wall Street Journal characterizes Trump 2.0 as "in trouble" [8], while multiple analyses catalog "the most consequential, damaging, head-scratching things Trump did in his first 100 days" [9].

### 1.2 Executive Actions and Policy Implementation

President Trump has issued numerous executive orders reflecting what Fox News terms an "unprecedented use of presidential authority" [1]. Key directives include requiring truck drivers to speak English [2], implementing auto industry tariffs [3], and targeting sanctuary cities while authorizing military involvement in domestic law enforcement [4].

The administration has set a July 4 deadline for Trump's tax agenda [5] while spending approximately $220 billion more in the first 100 days than the previous year, despite promises of fiscal restraint [6]. The White House has used government powers against more than 100 perceived enemies [7]. Multiple media outlets highlight substantial policy shifts as Trump attempts to "remake America" [8].

## 2. Government Structure and Authority

### 2.1 DOGE Operations and Conflicts

Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) faces significant scrutiny. A Senate report values Musk's conflicts of interest at $2.37 billion [1], warning he may leverage governmental influence to avoid legal liability. Despite Musk's mission to reduce government size, federal spending has increased by $171 billion over prior years [2]. Reports indicate Musk has lost approximately 25% of his fortune during his government role [3].

DOGE's impact is becoming visible across agencies. The Peace Corps faces "significant" cuts following a DOGE assessment [4], with state-level impacts described as "devastating" in Wyoming regarding AmeriCorps [5]. A new lawsuit directly challenges President Trump and DOGE's government overhaul plans [6], with top Democrats claiming the administration has disrupted approximately $430 billion in federal funds [7].

### 2.2 Federal Agency Restructuring

The administration has dramatically restructured federal agencies. The Department of Homeland Security abruptly terminated remote work policies, requiring some employees to send selfies to verify office presence [1]. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth canceled a program on women in security previously signed into law by Trump [2], publicly expressing pride in ending the Women, Peace and Security program [3].

The administration has dismissed all authors involved in producing the National Climate Assessment [4], while the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has sued over what they claim were illegal firings of board members [5]. President Trump has fired Biden-era appointees from the Holocaust Museum board, including Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff [6].

## 3. Immigration and Border Enforcement

### 3.1 Deportation Policies and Implementation

The administration has intensified immigration enforcement dramatically. Reports characterize this period as an "unprecedented phase of mass deportation" [1], with operations expanding to involve multiple federal agencies, including U.S. Postal Service law enforcement [2]. The administration has begun criminally charging migrants for entering newly established restricted military zones at the border [3].

Trump's border czar has insisted that three U.S. citizen children sent to Honduras "weren't deported" [4], while ICE enforcement official Homan has publicly defended the deportation of U.S. citizen children [5]. House Republicans have proposed charging $1,000 to claim asylum [6], while Portland's mayor has defended the city's sanctuary status against renewed threats from the administration [7].

### 3.2 Humanitarian and Civil Rights Concerns

The human impact of current immigration policies has generated significant concern. ICE reportedly gave a deportee mother who is a U.S. citizen just "2 minutes to decide" her citizen children's fate [1]. Lawyers report that mothers deported under the Trump administration are being "denied" the opportunity to legally transfer custody of their children [2]. One Oklahoma City family was reportedly traumatized after ICE raided their home despite their protests that "We're citizens!" [3].

Children are reportedly being "targeted in immigration crackdown" [4], with tracking efforts documenting U.S. citizens caught in enforcement actions [5]. Families of detained individuals are drawing parallels to Latin American dictatorships, specifically using the phrase "they disappear them" [6].

## 4. Economic and Trade Policy

### 4.1 Tariff Implementation and Corporate Responses

A major confrontation erupted between the White House and Amazon over tariff transparency. Amazon reportedly considered showing customers how much of a product's price comes from recently implemented tariffs [1], but abandoned the plan after the White House labeled it "hostile" [2]. President Trump reportedly personally complained to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos about the idea [3].

Corporate America is adapting to the tariff regime with varying impacts. UPS announced cutting 20,000 jobs amid likely lower Amazon shipments [4], while General Motors delayed an investor call amid "corporate chaos" stemming from tariff implementation [5]. After implementing broad tariffs, the administration granted automakers specific relief [6]. Small businesses dependent on imports from China report feeling "nowhere to turn" [7].

### 4.2 International Trade Relations

Chinese exports to the U.S. have plunged dramatically [1], while the Port of Los Angeles has warned about "difficult decisions" ahead as shipments from China cease [2]. China has adopted a defiant posture toward Trump's trade policies, vowing to "stand firm" while urging nations to resist a "'bully' Trump" [3].

U.S. consumer confidence has plummeted to levels not seen since the COVID-19 pandemic, with the trade war cited as a primary factor [4]. Tariffs-related stockpiling has boosted the U.S. goods trade deficit to a record high [5]. The administration is preparing financial relief for farmers affected by trade disputes [6], while Treasury Secretary Howard Bessent has indicated the U.S. is "very close" to a trade deal with India [7].

## 5. Foreign Policy and Justice System

### 5.1 International Relations and Law Enforcement

Despite Trump's campaign promise to achieve peace within 100 days, the Kyiv Independent reports that Russia's violence against Ukraine has only escalated during this period [1]. Ukrainian President Zelensky has accused Russian President Putin of "deceiving" Trump with a new three-day ceasefire proposal [2]. Canada's Prime Minister Carney stated "Canada's Old Relationship With US Is Over" [3], with the European Union reportedly "reeling" from the administration's actions [4].

Federal law enforcement agencies are employing aggressive tactics. The FBI is using polygraphs for "leak hunts" [5]. President Trump has issued an executive order titled "Strengthening and Unleashing America's Law Enforcement" [6], while Attorney General Pam Bondi has issued what's described as a "chilling warning to judges," reportedly stating "We Will Find You" [7]. The DOJ's Civil Rights Division is experiencing an exodus, with "over 100" attorneys having departed [8].

### 5.2 Healthcare and Environmental Policy

Healthcare policy has emerged as a focal point of administration activity. Medicaid has become central to policy debates, with Republican senators publicly criticizing House-proposed changes to Medicaid as "cutting benefits" [1]. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s role as HHS Secretary has sparked controversy, with his sister publicly stating that "he is not an appropriate HHS Secretary" [2]. Kennedy is planning a $20 million "Take Back Your Health" ad campaign through HHS [3].

The administration has taken significant steps to reshape environmental policy, with all authors working on the National Climate Assessment dismissed [4]. Concerns about U.S. scientific research have emerged, with Nature publishing an article asking "Will US science survive Trump 2.0?" [5], and reporting that 75% of U.S. scientists in a poll are considering leaving [6].
