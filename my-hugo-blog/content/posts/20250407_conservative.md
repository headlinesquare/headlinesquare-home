## 3. TRADE POLICY AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS

### 3.1 Trump Tariff Implementation and Strategy  
President Trump is pursuing an aggressive tariff strategy, particularly targeting China with threats of additional 50% tariffs if Beijing doesn't eliminate retaliatory measures [1][2]. The President has indicated he would veto any legislation attempting to limit his tariff authority [3] and is reportedly unwilling to compromise with China unless the trade deficit issue is resolved [4]. Despite market volatility in response [5], Trump has characterized tariffs as a "beautiful thing to behold" and warned against being what he termed a "Panican" party of "weak and stupid people" [6]. Administration officials have publicly defended these policies in sometimes contentious media appearances [7].

The White House reports more than 50 countries have initiated contact to discuss tariffs with the Trump administration [1][2], indicating the global impact of U.S. trade policies. Nations are responding diversely, from retaliatory measures to acquiescence. China has escalated by cutting off rare earth mineral exports to the U.S. [3], while the UK prime minister is reportedly preparing to declare "globalization is over" in response to Trump's tariffs [4]. The European Union has offered a "zero-for-zero" tariff resolution that would eliminate industrial fees on U.S. goods [5].

## 4. IMMIGRATION AND BORDER SECURITY

### 4.1 Deportation Cases and Judicial Intervention  
A complex legal battle has emerged over an individual's deportation to El Salvador, with Chief Justice Roberts intervening to pause the deadline for the person's return to the United States [1][2]. The case reveals tensions between judiciary and executive branches on immigration enforcement. While AP News describes the man as "mistakenly deported" [1], other sources characterize him as an "alleged MS-13 gang member" [2]. The Department of Justice has challenged the judicial order, arguing judges lack authority to order deported migrants' return [3].

### 4.2 Border and Migration Policy Developments  
A "quiet crisis" is reportedly developing at the northern U.S. border related to human smuggling [1]. In policy debates, Elon Musk has made apparently contradictory statements, reportedly claiming "mass migration destroys countries" while simultaneously supporting the H-1B visa program for skilled workers [2]. Meanwhile, "dozens" of international students and alumni from California universities have lost their visas [3], though specific policy changes driving these revocations remain unclear.
