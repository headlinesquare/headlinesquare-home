## 2. TRADE AND ECONOMIC POLICY

### 2.1 Tariff Implementation and Strategy
The administration has implemented a 10% universal tariff on imported goods, characterized by Reuters as "smashing global trade norms." Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick declared that tariffs are "here to stay" and can "reset the power of the United States of America." President Trump has forecast that it may take up to two years for tariffs to bolster American manufacturing and has urged Americans to "hang tough" as these measures take effect.

A Republican representative condemned firings linked to Laura Loomer's Oval Office visit. The administration reportedly "weakens U.S. cyberdefenses at a moment of rising danger," while an internal security breach involving a White House Signal group chat underscored vulnerabilities in communication channels.
