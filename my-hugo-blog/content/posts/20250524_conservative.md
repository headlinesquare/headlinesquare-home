### 1.1 Trump Administration Actions & Policies

The Trump administration has secured several policy and legal victories this month. A judge has ruled that Trump acted lawfully regarding Chinese tariffs, representing a court win for the White House [1]. The administration announced a major job-creating deal that was reportedly blocked by Biden during his final days in office [2]. In a significant address to the U.S. Army Academy's graduating class of 2025 [3], President Trump stated that "The job of the US Armed Forces is not to host drag shows, to change foreign cultures, or to spread democracy ... at the point of a gun" [4]. The White House has highlighted economic improvements, announcing the "lowest Memorial Day weekend prices since 2021," attributed to what one source calls "The Trump Effect" [5].

### 1.2 Biden Administration Legacy

Media outlets continue to analyze the former president's cognitive state, with one questioning whether Democrats will "learn anything from the Biden decline cover-up" [4].
