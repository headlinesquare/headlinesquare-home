## 1. Executive Power and Governance

### 1.1 Executive Orders and Federal Authority
President Trump has issued executive orders reshaping federal policies, signing directives aimed at "revitalizing the coal industry" [1] and using them to fuel artificial intelligence infrastructure [2]. A federal judge ordered the White House to restore Associated Press's access to official events, citing First Amendment protections and establishing a check on executive power to restrict press access [3]. The administration has disbanded the Justice Department's crypto-related enforcement team [4] and withdrawn 11 pieces of ADA guidance, raising questions about accessibility compliance standards [5].

### 1.2 DOGE Operations and Federal Workforce
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Elon Musk has implemented monitoring of federal workers [1], reportedly scanning for "anti-Trump, Musk messages" [2]. An appeals court has ruled that DOGE "can access sensitive data for now" [3], expanding investigative capabilities. The Supreme Court backed "Trump for now on fired probationary federal employees" [4] and blocked an order requiring reinstatement of thousands of federal workers [5]. The White House characterized tensions between Musk and trade adviser Peter Navarro as "boys will be boys" [6], while Democratic oversight committees probe "White House Use of Musk's Starlink" citing "considerable red flags" [7].

## 2. Trade and Economic Policy

### 2.1 US-China Trade War and Tariff Implementation
The White House confirmed tariffs on China will increase to at least 104% on Wednesday [1], prompting Beijing to characterize this as "a mistake upon a mistake" [2] and vow to "fight to the end" [3]. China implemented significant countermeasures, including export controls on key rare earth materials [4]. Economists warn of a "Category 5 Price Storm" [5], while one researcher claims the White House "cited my research to justify tariffs" but "got it all wrong" [6]. The administration is considering adjusting a port fee plan for Chinese vessels after receiving pushback [7].

Trump's tariffs are already reducing car imports and idling factories [1], with JPMorgan assessing recession risk at 60% [2] and Wall Street traders stating "Without doubt, we're hitting a recession" [3]. Canada is imposing tariffs of up to 25% on vehicles imported from the U.S. in retaliation [4]. Within the administration, Elon Musk explicitly labeled Navarro a "moron" [5] and "dumber than a sack of bricks" [6], with this conflict described as "open civil war" within the Cabinet [7]. Musk made direct appeals to Trump to reverse the tariffs [8], while reports indicate Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wants to quit over tariff policies [9].

### 3.1 Deportation Actions and Legal Status Revocations
The Trump administration revoked legal status for approximately 985,000 migrants who entered under the Biden-era CBP One app [1], with California colleges scrambling to determine the scope of student visa cancellations [2]. Reports indicate a Maryland man was deported to El Salvador by mistake, with AG Pam Bondi stating he "should stay where he is" [3]. U.S. deportees in El Salvador live in cells identical to those housing convicted gang members [4]. Most controversially, the White House reportedly floated the idea of deporting U.S. citizens [5], while planning to implement a $998 daily fine for migrants who fail to leave after deportation orders [6].

## 4. Judicial Developments and International Relations

### 4.1 Supreme Court and DOJ Actions
The Supreme Court ruled on the Alien Enemies Act, allowing the Trump administration to use this 18th-century law for deportations [1] while requiring that deportees "must be able to 'actually seek' relief before being deported" [2]. Justice Sotomayor warned that the Court has "rubber-stamped Trump's authority to deport people to foreign prisons" [3]. The DOJ announced plans to reduce enforcement of cryptocurrency fraud cases [4] and instructed prosecutors to ease up on crypto enforcement [5]. Serious allegations emerged regarding a fired DOJ pardon attorney, with U.S. Marshals reportedly "mobilized to warn fired DOJ lawyer over congressional testimony" [6].

Social Security is experiencing disruptions, with reports that the system wrongly told disabled people and seniors their benefits had ended [3]. Despite President Trump's campaign promise not to touch Social Security, the system is reportedly experiencing staff cuts and rushed changes as Musk's team plans cuts to phone services [4].

Major demonstrations against the Trump administration have been described as "one of the largest demonstrations since Trump's return to power" [4], with Rolling Stone suggesting these protests are "just the beginning" [5].
