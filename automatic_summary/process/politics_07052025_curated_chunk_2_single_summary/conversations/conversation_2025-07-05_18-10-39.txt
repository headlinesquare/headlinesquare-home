**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is July, 2025. The executive branch expanded their power dramatically, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025], and the tech czar Elon Musk [The founder and former head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)]. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. Later, Elon Musk left DOGE, but his influence continues. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I am ready.

I have fully processed the operational parameters, the political context for July 2025, the provided lists of officials, and the strict, multi-step workflow for generating the Daily Briefing.

As Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership, I understand my mandate is to produce an objective, fact-based intelligence product useful to both sides for situational awareness and strategic planning. My analysis will be based exclusively on the information you provide, acknowledging that my internal knowledge base is outdated. I will adhere to the principles of factual accuracy and will note any ambiguities from the source material directly.

I am prepared to receive the JSONL news feed and begin with Step 1.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    User: 
====================

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.


====================
    Round 3
    Assistant: 
====================

Upon review, I have refined the initial category structure to better organize the provided news items and improve cognitive clarity for the intended audience. The primary goal was to create a more balanced and logically flowing framework.

Here is the updated `step1.txt`.

```text
Area 1: Executive Branch Operations & Controversies
    Topic 1.1: Presidential Actions, Rhetoric, and Public Perception
    Topic 1.2: Agency Management, Restructuring, and Controversies
    Topic 1.3: Foreign Policy and National Security

Area 2: The 'Megabill' and its Economic & Social Consequences
    Topic 2.1: General Analysis, Tax Provisions, and Political Fallout
    Topic 2.2: Impacts on Social Programs and Healthcare
    Topic 2.3: Impacts on Energy and Environmental Policy

Area 3: Immigration and Border Policy
    Topic 3.1: Enforcement Actions and Detention Practices
    Topic 3.2: Deportations and Border Management
    Topic 3.3: Public and Legal Responses to Immigration Policies

Area 4: Judicial Branch and Legal System
    Topic 4.1: Supreme Court Rulings and Justice Analysis
    Topic 4.2: Federal Court Orders and Legal Challenges

Area 5: Congress, Political Parties, and Public Opinion
    Topic 5.1: Congressional Operations and Legislation
    Topic 5.2: Party Politics and Third-Party Developments
    Topic 5.3: Public Opinion and Political Commentary

Area 6: Social, Health, and Civil Rights Issues
    Topic 6.1: Extremism and Social Division
    Topic 6.2: Public Health Concerns and Data
    Topic 6.3: Civil Rights and Education Controversies
```

### Revisions Made:

1.  **Consolidation of Legislative Action:** I merged the original "Area 7: Legislative Branch - Specific Bills" into "Area 5." The original Area 7 was too sparse, containing only two minor bill announcements. This content fits more logically within a broader area focused on congressional and political affairs.
2.  **Restructuring of Area 5:** The newly broadened "Area 5: Congress, Political Parties, and Public Opinion" now provides a more comprehensive overview of the political landscape. Its topics now cleanly delineate between the functional business of Congress (Topic 5.1), the dynamics of political parties including potential new ones (Topic 5.2), and the public's reaction via polls and media commentary (Topic 5.3).
3.  **Refinement of Area 6:** I retitled this area to "Social, Health, and Civil Rights Issues" to better reflect its contents. Topic 6.3 was also revised to "Civil Rights and Education Controversies" to more accurately encompass issues like the gender-affirming passports and the debate over LGBTQ+ content in schools, framing them within a civil rights context.
4.  **Minor Title Adjustments:** Several other minor wording changes were made to Area and Topic titles for clarity and conciseness (e.g., "Border Zone Management" became "Border Management").

This revised 6-area structure is more robust, balanced, and better aligns related concepts, which should make the final briefing more intuitive and useful for leadership.


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    Round 5

====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 5
    Assistant: 
====================

After sorting the categorized articles and conducting a thorough review, I can confirm that all 58 news items have been uniquely and exhaustively assigned to the defined categories. The hierarchical structure of the `step2_categorized.txt` file is now complete.

### Revisions Made:

During my verification process, I performed a full recount of the articles to ensure none were missing or duplicated. My initial analysis from Step 2 correctly assigned all 58 articles, and the categorization logic holds up under review. No articles needed to be moved between categories. The main task in this step was restructuring the data from a chronologically-ordered list into the final, sorted, hierarchical format below, which is now ready for the subsequent stages of the briefing preparation.

====================
    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant: 
====================

After conducting a second, independent and thorough review of the categorized articles against the original source list, I have confirmed that the initial categorization from the previous step is accurate, logical, and complete.

### Revisions Made:

Upon careful re-examination, no changes were necessary. The process for this second check involved:

1.  **Exhaustive Cross-Verification:** Each of the 58 original news items was individually checked against its placement in the categorized list to ensure none were omitted or duplicated.
2.  **Logical Placement Review:** The assignment of each article to its specific Area and Topic was critically re-evaluated. For example, the cluster of articles related to the National Weather Service and DOGE cuts was confirmed to be best placed under "Agency Management," and the article regarding the Supreme Court's ruling on LGBTQ+ books was confirmed to be correctly placed under "Civil Rights and Education Controversies" due to its focus on the societal and educational impact rather than the legal doctrine itself.
3.  **Count Confirmation:** A final count of all articles within the hierarchical structure was performed, confirming a total of 58 items, matching the input.

The structure remains robust. All 58 articles are uniquely and appropriately placed. The following `step2_categorized.txt` is the validated output, identical to the previous step, and is ready for the subsequent scoring phase.
