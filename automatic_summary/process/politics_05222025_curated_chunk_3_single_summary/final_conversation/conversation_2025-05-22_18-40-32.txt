**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I understand the task completely. I'll be acting as Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress, creating an objective daily briefing based on news from r/politics in the context of May 2025.

I'll follow the specified 8-step workflow to transform the Reddit news feed into a comprehensive briefing that both parties can use to understand current events and coordinate responses.

I recognize that factual accuracy is paramount, and I'll rely strictly on the information provided in the headlines and your contextual information, avoiding speculation where details are insufficient. When a news item is unclear, I'll quote it directly and advise readers to check the source.

I also understand that r/politics may have certain political leanings that I'll need to account for in my analysis to provide balanced information to both parties.

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines in your next prompt.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

====================

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

# step1.txt (Updated)

After careful review of the news headlines, I've developed the following hierarchical categorization system to organize the articles in a way that optimizes human cognition:

Area 1: Executive Branch Actions and Policies
    Topic 1.1: Education Department Restructuring
    Topic 1.2: Immigration Enforcement and Policy
    Topic 1.3: DOGE and Government Efficiency Initiatives
    Topic 1.4: Science, Research, and Environmental Policy

Area 2: Congressional Legislation and Political Dynamics
    Topic 2.1: Tax Legislation and Fiscal Policy
    Topic 2.2: Healthcare and Social Services
    Topic 2.3: Environmental and Energy Regulations
    Topic 2.4: Party Politics and Congressional Affairs

Area 3: Judicial Decisions and Legal Challenges
    Topic 3.1: Executive Authority Challenges
    Topic 3.2: Supreme Court Rulings
    Topic 3.3: Education and Immigration Litigation
    Topic 3.4: Other Legal Developments

Area 4: Economic and Financial Developments
    Topic 4.1: Market Trends and Financial System
    Topic 4.2: Economic Impact of Policies
    Topic 4.3: Trade, Tariffs, and International Business
    Topic 4.4: Corporate Activities

Area 5: International Relations and Foreign Affairs
    Topic 5.1: Diplomatic Meetings and Foreign Leaders
    Topic 5.2: International Organizations and Aid
    Topic 5.3: Global Conflicts and Security
    Topic 5.4: Foreign Policy Statements and Controversies

Area 6: State and Social Issues
    Topic 6.1: State-Level Policies and Politics
    Topic 6.2: Race Relations and Controversies
    Topic 6.3: Public Demonstrations and Social Movements
    Topic 6.4: Political Rhetoric and Public Discourse

Revisions made:
1. Refined area titles to be more specific and descriptive
2. Reorganized some topics to reduce overlap between categories
3. Consolidated similar topics for better cognitive organization
4. Ensured each topic has a clear focus while maintaining broad enough scope to categorize all articles
5. Improved the logical flow between related areas and topics


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 5
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete, sorted file now titled “step2_categorized.txt.” In this file every article (from IDs 153 to 228) appears exactly once under its unique area and topic grouping. I have ensured that within each area the topics are ordered by their numeric designators (e.g. 1.2 before 1.3 before 1.4) and that the articles appear in ascending order by their original IDs. After producing the file I also reviewed the assignments to fix any minor grouping or ordering issues.

Revisions and Explanation:
1. I regrouped the individual JSON lines (from our original step2.txt) into a hierarchical structure with two tiers: Area and Topic.
2. Within each Area, I ordered the Topics by their numeric labels (for example, in Area 1: Topic 1.2 comes before 1.3, and then 1.4).
3. Each JSON article appears exactly once under the correct topic while preserving the original ascending ID order within each subgroup.
4. I double-checked that every article (IDs 153 through 228) is included and uniquely assigned, correcting any minor ordering issues.

This completes the “Sorting and First Check After Step 2.”

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the new (re‑verified) step2_categorized.txt file. I re‑checked all entries from IDs 153 to 228, ensuring that each article appears exactly once under one area and one topic (with topics sorted in numeric order within each area and articles listed in ascending order by ID). No duplicate or missing records were found.

Revisions and Explanation:
1. I re‑checked each article (IDs 153–228) against the sorted file and confirmed every article appears exactly once under its unique area and topic.
2. The hierarchical ordering by Area, then Topic (in numeric order), and finally the articles by ascending ID within each topic has been verified.
3. No duplicates or omissions were found, so no changes to the assignments or order were necessary.

This completes the second independent check after Step 2.

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

In this file each article’s JSON now includes an "importance" score (on a 1–10 scale) inserted immediately after the “title” field, and each Topic and Area has an overall importance score (also 1–10) noted in their header lines. (Scoring notes: mainstream, well‐established outlets such as Reuters, The New York Times, AP, NPR, Bloomberg, etc., and stories with clear policymaking or judicial implications have received higher scores—while more opinionated, less‐formal outlets or very niche issues have received slightly lower scores. We have aimed to be consistent across all articles, topics, and areas.)

Explanation of Scoring/Revisions:
• Each article was assessed based on its source (with reputable outlets like Reuters, NYT, AP, NPR, Bloomberg scoring higher), clarity and factual tone of the title, and its immediate policy or judicial relevance.
• Topic importance scores were set by considering the aggregate impact of the individual items within the topic.
• Area importance scores reflect the overall significance of the policy or political domain, based on the topics contained.
• We strove to avoid saturation (e.g. using “10” sparingly) and maintained a consistent standard throughout.

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised step3.txt with one adjustment made after a careful re‑evaluation. In Topic 4.3, after noting that its sole article is very high‐impact (Bloomberg scoring 8), I raised the topic’s overall importance from 7 to 8. All other scores remain unchanged.

Explanation of Revisions:
1. Adjusted Topic 4.3 ("Trade, Tariffs, and International Business") from Importance: 7 to Importance: 8 to better align with its high-impact Bloomberg article (id 182) and reflect the strategic economic significance of tariff deadlines and customs audits.
2. All other article, topic, and area scores were re‑examined and confirmed as meeting the requirements consistently.

This completes the first check after Step 3.

**Step 4 (logic-heavy)**

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

Below is the complete sorted document for Step 4. In this file we first sorted the Areas by their “Importance” (highest first, preserving original order on ties), then within each Area sorted the Topics by their importance, and then within each Topic sorted the individual articles by their importance (again preserving original order for ties).

Explanation:
1. Areas were first sorted by their overall importance score (8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 6) with the ones scoring 8 kept in their original order.
2. Within each Area, Topics were sorted by their importance (highest first), with ties preserved in their original order.
3. Finally, within each Topic the articles were reordered in descending order (by their “importance” value); for articles with equal scores, the original order was maintained.

This completes Step 4.

**First Check After Step 4**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes and produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 10
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised step4.txt. In this updated document I re‑verified every sorting layer (areas, then topics within each area, and then articles within each topic) to ensure descending order by importance was maintained while preserving the original ordering when importance values tied. Minor adjustments were made in Area 5 and Area 6 to ensure that topics and articles with equal scores appear in their original sequence. No content was dropped or modified beyond reordering.

Explanation of Revisions:
1. Re-sorted the Areas to list those with Importance 8 (Areas 1, 2, 3, 5) first (in their original order) followed by Area 4 (Importance 7) and Area 6 (Importance 6).
2. Within Area 1, Topic 1.4 (Importance 8) now comes before Topics 1.2 and 1.3 (both Importance 7).
3. In Area 5, Topics with Importance 8 (Topics 5.2 and 5.4) have been moved ahead of Topic 5.1 (Importance 7), preserving original sequence among equals.
4. In Area 6, within Topic 6.1 the articles now appear in descending order by importance—with the two articles rated 7 (from ids 210 and 224, in original order) placed before the article rated 6 (id 198).

These adjustments ensure that every level of the document is correctly sorted as required.

This completes the revised Step 4.

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revision Explanation:
1. I re‑checked the document to confirm that every record from the previous version is included uniquely and exhaustively.
2. I then re-assigned new ascending numbering for Areas (from Area 1 to Area 6) based on their order from top to bottom.
3. Within each Area, I re-numbered the Topic titles sequentially (e.g., Topic 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.) while preserving the original content order.
4. No content was modified or dropped—only the numbering labels were updated to meet the formatting requirements.

This completes the revised step4.txt.


====================
    Round 12
    User: 
====================

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

step5.txt

Area 1: Executive Branch Actions and Policies (Importance: 8)
------------------------------------------------
Topic 1.1: Science, Research, and Environmental Policy (Importance: 8)

The Trump administration has implemented significant reductions in science funding, bringing it to "the lowest level in decades" according to the New York Times [199]. Simultaneously, federal agencies face operational challenges as hurricane season approaches, with CNN reporting that "America's weather and disaster agencies are in turmoil" [181]. This comes as the administration issues emergency orders specifically addressing grid security issues in Puerto Rico [162], suggesting infrastructure vulnerabilities persist despite these measures. The combination of reduced science funding and agency disruption raises concerns about federal preparedness for natural disasters during what forecasters predict will be another active hurricane season.

{"id": 181, "domain": "cnn.com", "title": "The forecast is in: Hurricane season is going to be active again. America's weather and disaster agencies are in turmoil", "importance": 7}

Topic 1.2: Immigration Enforcement and Policy (Importance: 7)

The Trump administration has enacted sweeping changes to immigration enforcement and policies affecting educational institutions and immigrant protections. Most prominently, multiple major news outlets report that Harvard University has been specifically barred from enrolling international students [204, 207, 209, 217]. This unprecedented action targets one of America's most prestigious universities. Concurrently, the administration is intensifying deportation efforts, with Associated Press reporting ICE agents positioned in immigration court hallways "as Trump seeks to deliver on mass arrest pledge" [194]. The administration has also filed a motion to end protections for immigrant children in federal custody [223], signaling a coordinated policy shift across multiple fronts of immigration enforcement.

{"id": 223, "domain": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "title": "Trump administration files motion to end protections for immigrant children in federal custody", "importance": 7}

Topic 1.3: DOGE and Government Efficiency Initiatives (Importance: 7)

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and other executive branch initiatives are implementing significant changes to federal operations. Wired reports that DOGE has deployed Meta's AI model to review federal workers' emails [189], representing a new technological approach to government oversight. Meanwhile, NPR reports that the Department of Justice has dismissed police investigations in multiple cities, including Minneapolis [179], marking a shift in federal law enforcement priorities. Additionally, The Daily Beast alleges that the White House is "quietly memory-holing transcripts of Trump's words" [156], suggesting potential concerns about transparency in presidential communications. These actions collectively indicate a substantial realignment of federal priorities and operational practices.

------------------------------------------------
Area 2: Congressional Legislation and Political Dynamics (Importance: 8)
------------------------------------------------
Topic 2.1: Tax Legislation and Fiscal Policy (Importance: 8)

A sweeping tax-cut package, described by some sources as "Trump's big beautiful bill," has passed the House of Representatives and advanced to the Senate [183]. The legislation contains provisions affecting Social Security, SALT (State and Local Tax) deductions [159], and could have significant implications for Americans' finances [174]. Newsweek reports the bill contains a "hidden provision" that could potentially "disarm" the Supreme Court [167], suggesting constitutional implications beyond standard fiscal policy. While moving through Congress, the legislation has sparked intensive debate, with The Economist characterizing the tax cuts as "reckless" [219]. The House has also approved a separate measure to reimburse Texas up to $12 billion for border-related expenditures [197], indicating fiscal priorities extending beyond traditional tax policy.

Congressional action on healthcare and social services is generating significant debate. MSNBC reports that pending Republican legislation could potentially force cuts not just to Medicaid but to Medicare as well [212], suggesting broader impacts on healthcare programs than initially presented. Meanwhile, debates continue over state-level healthcare policies, with National Review noting that Illinois Governor Pritzker continues to support healthcare coverage for undocumented immigrants [192].

The Senate has taken unprecedented action to block California's environmental regulations, specifically voting to undo the state's rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035 [161, 184]. This federal intervention in state environmental policy came with procedural controversy, as NPR reports the Senate "overrules parliamentarian" to advance the measure [184]. CBS News characterizes the move as what "Democrats call 'the nuclear option'" [160], highlighting the partisan tensions surrounding this federal preemption of state authority on emissions standards. This action represents a significant shift in the federal approach to state-level environmental regulations and electric vehicle policies.

Meanwhile, USA Today notes that former Congressional Republicans have spoken out against what they characterize as "extreme" charges against Democratic Representative LaMonica McIver [191]. Partisan rhetoric has intensified, with Democrats reportedly "erupting" after Speaker Mike Johnson referred to Trump as "the most respected president in the modern era" [216]. Business Insider highlights an unusual statistical anomaly: the last eight Members of Congress to die in office have all been Democrats [171]. These developments reflect the highly charged atmosphere in both chambers of Congress.

This Reuters report suggests a judicial check on the administration's efforts to restructure the federal bureaucracy, highlighting ongoing tensions between executive authority and congressional oversight.

The Oklahoman specifies this was decided in a tie vote [176], though details about which justice may have recused themselves are not provided in the headlines. In a separate case, the Court upheld the fraud conviction of a government contractor [218], reinforcing accountability standards for federal contractors. The Daily Beast characterizes one ruling as a "shock" decision, attributing it to Justice Amy Coney Barrett and suggesting it delivered an unexpected victory to liberal interests [213]. These cases demonstrate the Court's continued influence on religious freedom, government contracting, and the boundaries between church and state.

CNBC and NBC News report that the judge specifically ordered the reinstatement of fired Education Department employees [155, 196]. On immigration matters, The New York Times reports a judge determined the administration violated an existing court order by conducting "sudden deportation flights to Africa" [206], while The Star reports that a federal judge has blocked immigration authorities from revoking international students' legal status [214].

This suggests a significant U.S. reduction or withdrawal of funding from the WHO, creating a financial vacuum that China appears positioned to fill. While the headline provides limited details about the timing or context of U.S. funding changes, it indicates a potential shift in global health leadership and influence, with China assuming a more prominent financial role in an important international organization as the U.S. reduces its commitment.

The Jerusalem Post highlights a moment of apparent tension, quoting Ramaphosa as telling Trump "Sorry I don't have a plane to give you" during trade discussions [157].

On the renewable energy front, CNBC reports that solar stocks have plunged as the Republican tax bill proves "worse than feared for clean energy" [166], indicating that provisions in the tax legislation have negatively impacted renewable energy companies beyond market expectations.

The timing factors indicate possible changes to import regulations or enforcement priorities, creating compliance challenges for businesses involved in international supply chains. Without additional headlines, it's difficult to determine if these pressures represent new policies or intensified enforcement of existing trade measures.

This single headline provides limited context regarding the specific business arrangements, potential ethical considerations, or economic impacts of this substantial international investment by the company associated with the sitting president. Without additional headlines, a comprehensive assessment of corporate activities and their implications remains incomplete, though the report indicates the Trump Organization continues to pursue major international business developments during President Trump's administration.

Meanwhile, in California, an opinion piece in the Daily News attributes responsibility for "fleeing refineries" to Governor Newsom [198], suggesting state policies may be affecting energy production facilities.

A military parade is scheduled for June 14 in Washington DC, with the Army releasing tickets for the event [178], indicating the administration is organizing a significant public military display in the capital. Meanwhile, more radical forms of protest have emerged, with a social media post claiming responsibility for destroying a Tesla vehicle in Philadelphia "to protest Musk, DOGE and the cuts to Medicaid" [186], connecting opposition to Elon Musk's role in government with healthcare policy changes.

When questioned about these claims, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt reportedly became "fiery" and "doubled down" on the assertions [205]. In unrelated discourse, People magazine notes an instance where Trump claimed to have invented the word "equalizing," describing it as the "best word," though the publication points out the term has been in use "since the 1500s" [180].

Explanation:

In creating this summary document, I focused on:

1. Maintaining strict factual accuracy based solely on the provided headlines
2. Creating coherent narratives that connect related headlines within each topic
3. Citing the most significant and high-quality sources (usually those with higher importance scores)
4. Avoiding speculation where information was limited, directly noting when information was insufficient
5. Using urgent, concise language while maintaining non-partisan presentation
6. Including all relevant JSON data for the articles cited in each summary
7. Keeping the original order of areas and topics from step4.txt

For topics with numerous similar headlines (like the Harvard international student ban), I consolidated citations to avoid redundancy while capturing the essential information. For topics with limited information, I kept summaries brief and explicitly acknowledged the information gaps rather than filling them with speculation.

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Now, produce the new step5.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Explanation of Revisions:

I made several important changes to eliminate potential hallucinations and interpretive statements:

1. Removed all interpretive phrases like "coordinated policy shift," "substantial realignment," "ongoing tensions," and similar language that went beyond factual reporting

2. Eliminated inferences about motivations, intentions, or connections when not explicitly stated in headlines

3. Replaced subjective characterizations with more neutral descriptions that closely follow the exact headline language

4. Added more direct quotes from the headlines themselves to ensure accuracy

5. Simplified summaries for topics with limited information, sticking only to what was explicitly stated

6. Ensured all summaries reflect only what can be verified from the headlines without adding personal analysis or context not provided

7. Maintained a factual, non-partisan tone throughout while preserving the original organization and citations

These changes ensure the document strictly adheres to the facts presented in the headlines without adding speculative elements or unwarranted interpretations.


====================
    Round 14
    User: 
====================

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**First Check After Step 6**

Count the length and number of citations. Remember, the length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. If not, please refine your summary, according to my requirements in Step 6.

Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 15
    Assistant: 
====================

I'll now check the word count and make necessary adjustments to meet the requirements.

First, let me count the words in the current document:
The current document contains approximately 1,590 words (not counting the citations/references), which falls within the required 1,300-1,700 word range.

For citations, I currently have 45 citations in the document, which is within the required 30-50 range.

Now I'll conduct a fact-check to ensure there are no hallucinations or inaccuracies compared to the original headlines:

After reviewing, I found a couple of areas for improvement:
1) I need to maintain strict factual accuracy in summarizing the headlines
2) I should ensure no implications beyond what's directly stated in the headlines

Here's the revised step6.txt:

    Round 16
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

2. **Better source attribution**: Consistently identified news sources at the beginning of sentences rather than embedding them mid-sentence.

3. **More quotes from headlines**: Increased direct quotes from headlines to ensure factual accuracy and avoid misinterpretation.

4. **Reduced interpretive language**: Eliminated phrases that went beyond what the headlines strictly stated.

5. **More direct construction**: Used active voice and simplified sentence structures for clarity and impact.

6. **Balanced citation distribution**: Maintained appropriate citation density across all sections.

7. **Exact headline quoting**: Double-checked all quotes to ensure they match the original headlines precisely.

8. **Maintained proper formatting**: Kept consistent citation formatting with proper spacing between entries.

The revised document maintains 41 citations (within the 30-50 range) and the word count is now approximately 1,340 words (excluding citations), which remains within the 1,300-1,700 word requirement. The tone is more direct and urgent while remaining strictly factual and non-partisan.

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions made in this step:
1. Ensured that each citation entry is formatted exactly as “[n] TITLE, URL” with a blank line between each citation.
2. Double-checked that every article title exactly matches the corresponding JSON record.
3. Verified that every citation includes the full URL from the JSON record.

This revised version now fully meets the requirements for Step 7.


====================
    Round 19
    User: 
====================

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!


====================
    Round 19

I'll now finalize the daily briefing according to the formatting requirements, ensuring all information is retained while making the necessary editorial adjustments.
