    Round 1
    User: 
====================

**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/Conservative.**

r/Conservative is a subreddit dedicated to discussion and content from a conservative political perspective, primarily in the context of U.S. politics. Here's a brief overview:
**Focus:** Conservative values, ideas, and viewpoints.
**Content:** News articles, political commentary, opinion pieces, and discussions supportive of or aligned with right-leaning ideologies.
**Tone:** The subreddit encourages civil discourse among conservatives and welcomes questions from others, though it's not meant to be a debate forum for opposing views.
**Common Topics:** Fiscal conservatism, limited government, gun rights, immigration policy, criticism of liberal/progressive policies, and support for Republican politicians and platforms.

It's heavily moderated to maintain a conservative-friendly space, and moderation tends to enforce rules that limit trolling or ideological arguments from non-conservatives.

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I understand the task and scenario. I'll be acting as Chief News Analyst providing objective briefings to both Democratic and Republican congressional leadership in this May 2025 scenario with President Trump and DOGE head Elon Musk expanding executive power.

I'll analyze news from r/Conservative (a right-leaning subreddit) following your multi-step workflow:
1. Define news categories
2. Categorize articles
3. Score articles
4. Sort them
5. Summarize content
6. Compose the briefing
7. Add URLs
8. Finalize the document

I understand the temporal relationship between submission time and actual events, and will work through each step methodically in separate replies after receiving your JSON data.

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines and begin with Step 1.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.

    Topic 6.3: Congressional Responses to Administration
    Topic 6.4: Early 2028 Election Positioning

Area 7: Social & Cultural Issues

    Topic 7.3: Social Identity and DEI Initiatives
    Topic 7.4: Sports, Entertainment and Viral Content

**Revisions Explanation:**

I made several improvements to better organize the categories:
1. Moved drug pricing reforms to Area 1 since they're a major Trump executive action appearing in multiple headlines
2. Created a clearer Area 2 focused on economic policy and government efficiency
3. Refined immigration categories to include legal challenges
4. Better organized foreign policy to highlight Middle East issues prominently featured in the headlines
5. Sharpened the focus of the legal and political opposition categories
6. Ensured related topics are grouped together and created more intuitive category labels


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Below is the complete step2.txt. (Each line shows the assigned Area/Topic followed by the original JSON line, in ascending ID order.)

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions Explanation:
• I carefully regrouped each of the 116 articles assigned previously into the seven Areas and their four Topics as defined in Step 1.
• Within each Area, I created subheadings for each Topic and listed the full JSON articles (in ascending ID order from the original assignments) under the proper Topic.
• I verified that each article appears once and only in its uniquely assigned category, and the total count matches 116.
• Minor adjustments were made to ensure all articles are grouped exactly under the intended two-tier hierarchy (Area → Topic).

This completes Step 2: Sorting and First Check.

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Below is the revised step2_categorized.txt. In this version I have re‐checked every JSON record to ensure that all 116 items appear exactly once and are sorted in ascending order by their IDs within each topic, with no duplicates or omissions. I made one very minor formatting clarification (for example, verifying that the list under Area 7 includes all six articles in Topic 7.4 including id 86) and ensuring that every article remains in its originally assigned Area and Topic.

Revisions Explanation:
1. I re‑counted the articles in each Area and Topic to verify that all 116 records (IDs ranging from 1 to 116) appear exactly once.
2. I confirmed that within each Topic the JSON lines remain in ascending order by their IDs.
3. I ensured that the grouping under Area 7 now clearly shows all six articles in Topic 7.4 (including id 86) so that the total for Area 7 is correctly 15.
4. No articles were found missing or duplicated; only minor formatting clarifications were needed.

This completes the Second Check After Step 2.

    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

(All articles were scored on a 1–10 scale based on source reliability, title clarity/relevance, and overall policy impact. Topic scores were set by considering the number and weight of reports on that subject, and area scores reflect the combined weight of their topics.)

Revisions Explanation:
1. I re‑evaluated every article’s importance score with a consistent rubric—balancing source reliability, clarity of headline, and policy relevance. Several scores were adjusted (for example, tone‐driven pieces from commentary sites were given slightly lower scores and flagship policy actions received higher scores).
2. Topic importance scores were recalibrated based on the number of reports and their overall significance to national policy.
3. Area-level importance scores were revised to reflect the aggregated weight of their topics in this unprecedented situation.
4. All records were checked to appear uniquely and in their original categorization.

This completes the revised Step 3 output with all changes incorporated.

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

Revisions Explanation:
1. I rechecked the sorting at every level. For areas, those with importance 8 (Area 1, Area 3, Area 4) now appear in their original relative order followed by areas with importance 7 (Area 2, Area 5, Area 6) and finally Area 7.
2. Within each area, topics have been re‐sorted in descending order by their topic importance, with ties preserving the original Step 3 order.
3. Each topic’s articles have been grouped by importance (highest first) and sorted in their original order within each importance group.
4. In Topic 1.4 and Topic 6.2—as well as others—the ordering was carefully adjusted so that all items with a higher importance score are listed before those with lower scores.

This new step4.txt now fully meets the requirements for sorting as specified.


====================
    Round 11
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 11
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the new step4.txt file with updated ascending numbering for both areas and topics. All records have been checked to appear uniquely and exhaustively. The only changes made were to renumber the area and topic headings in ascending order while preserving the order and content otherwise exactly as before.

Revisions Explanation:
1. I verified that every record from the previous step was included uniquely and exhaustively.
2. I reassigned new ascending numbering for areas based on the order of appearance. The original “Area 1, Area 3, Area 4, …” ordering was renumbered as Area 1 through Area 7.
3. Within each area, the topic labels were renumbered sequentially (e.g., in Area 1 the topics are now Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3, and Topic 1.4) while preserving the original internal order and content.

This new step4.txt now meets all requirements with updated numbering.

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Area 1: Trump Administration & Executive Actions (Area importance: 8)

Topic 1.1: Trump's Healthcare and Drug Pricing Reforms (Topic importance: 8)
President Trump has signed what he described as "one of the most consequential executive orders in US history" targeting pharmaceutical pricing [6]. The order aims to slash drug prices by 30-80% [3, 71] by implementing a "Favored Nations" requirement [12] that would match U.S. drug prices with those paid in other countries. The administration has established a 30-day deadline for pharmaceutical companies to comply with these new pricing standards [81]. Multiple outlets report that Trump has directly challenged the pharmaceutical industry with this action [65], with some characterizing it as "going to war with Pharma" to ensure the country is "treated fairly" [79]. In a separate but related healthcare development, The Washington Post reportedly praised a Trump HHS report on pediatric surgeries, acknowledging it makes "a strong case for caution" regarding certain procedures [55].

Topic 1.2: Executive Orders and Policy Initiatives (Topic importance: 6)
Information on this topic is limited to a single headline referencing "The Consequential Trump Move No One's Noticed" [80]. Without additional context, the specific policy initiative this refers to remains unclear, though it suggests some significant but under-reported executive action has been taken by the administration.

• {"id": 80, "domain": "thefp.com", "title": "The Consequential Trump Move No One's Noticed", "importance": 6}

Topic 1.3: White House Operations and Personnel (Topic importance: 5)
The Trump administration has made personnel changes in federal cultural institutions, firing "the top US copyright official" shortly after terminating the Librarian of Congress [13]. No additional context is provided about the reasons for these dismissals or potential replacements for these positions.

• {"id": 13, "domain": "foxnews.com", "title": "Trump admin fires top US copyright official days after terminating Librarian of Congress", "importance": 5}

Topic 1.4: Presidential Communications and Events (Topic importance: 5)
The White House has implemented changes to its press operations, adding a "'new media' seat" at briefings, characterized as shaking up the "establishment" by providing an "alternative to 'archaic' press" [34]. In a confrontational exchange, President Trump publicly criticized an ABC reporter who questioned him about accepting a jet from Qatar, saying she "should be 'embarrassed'" [101]. On ceremonial duties, First Lady Melania Trump participated in a stamp unveiling ceremony honoring former First Lady Barbara Bush [9].

Area 2: Immigration & Border Security (Area importance: 8)

Topic 2.1: Border Enforcement and Statistics (Topic importance: 7)
Recent data from Customs and Border Protection indicates a dramatic reduction in southern border apprehensions, with numbers falling "more than 90% from year ago in April" [73]. In a separate border security measure, the U.S. has temporarily closed the southern border to livestock imports to prevent the spread of "deadly flies" [21]. At the local level, the Mayor of Nashville has signed an executive order establishing an "early warning system for immigration enforcement operations," though the specific purpose and functionality of this system are not detailed in the headlines [93].

Topic 2.2: ICE Operations and Deportations (Topic importance: 7)
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has conducted several significant enforcement operations. A major sweep in Houston resulted in the arrest of 422 illegal migrants, including individuals reportedly wanted for serious crimes including murder and arson [98]. In another case, DHS accused a Massachusetts city council member of having "incited chaos" during ICE's arrest of what the agency described as a "violent criminal alien" [4]. ICE also apprehended an MS-13 gang member with visible gang tattoos who had reportedly been deported nearly two decades ago and subsequently reentered the United States illegally [37].

Topic 2.3: Immigration Legal Challenges (Topic importance: 7)
The administration is engaged in various legal confrontations regarding immigration policy. The Department of Homeland Security has issued subpoenas to California, apparently investigating "possible cash benefits to illegals" [83]. A legal expert has highlighted the importance of a "centuries-old law" described as "crucial" for the administration's immigration enforcement position [62]. One report cites a former U.S. attorney claiming that illegal immigrants are creating a "swelling" of Democrats in the Electoral College [10]. In international comparisons, the UK under Prime Minister Starmer has announced intentions to reduce migration and emphasize English language requirements [77, 108]. On Mother's Day, DHS publicly honored "Tammy Nobles and All the Mothers Who Lost Loved Ones to Illegal Alien Crime" [16].

Area 3: Foreign Policy & International Relations (Area importance: 8)

Topic 3.1: Middle East Diplomacy and Hostage Situations (Topic importance: 8)
A significant diplomatic breakthrough occurred with the release of Edan Alexander, described as "the last living American hostage" held by Hamas, after more than 580 days in captivity [63, 64]. President Trump had previously announced Alexander would be "coming home" [22], with live coverage of his release later provided [66]. This development comes amid broader shifts in U.S. Middle East policy, including the conclusion of a "4th round of US-Iran talks" as Trump prepares for what's characterized as a "historic Middle East tour" [47]. These diplomatic initiatives appear to be creating tension with traditional allies, with reports indicating Trump is "straining relationship with Netanyahu" as his policies "increasingly isolate Israel" [82]. The administration's approach has created uncertainty about its ultimate direction, with one headline stating Trump's "Mideast Shifts Leave Everyone Guessing" [7]. Separately, Qatar has reportedly offered Trump a "jumbo jet to serve as Air Force One" [14], described elsewhere as a "$400M Luxury Jet 'gift'" [85], which has prompted scrutiny with cautions to "beware of Qataris bearing gifts" [68].

President Trump has announced that China has agreed to "fully open" its markets to U.S. businesses [72].

Topic 1.1: Trump's Healthcare and Drug Pricing Reforms (Topic importance: 8)
President Trump has signed what he described as "one of the most consequential executive orders in US history" targeting pharmaceutical pricing [6].

The administration has established a 30-day deadline for pharmaceutical companies to comply with these new pricing standards [81]. Multiple outlets report that Trump has directly challenged the pharmaceutical industry with this action [65], with some characterizing it as "going to war with Pharma" to ensure the country is "treated fairly" [79]. In a separate but related healthcare development, The Washington Post reportedly praised a Trump HHS report on pediatric surgeries, acknowledging it makes "a strong case for caution" regarding certain procedures [55].

In unusual news, one headline claims "witches report their spells against Trump aren't working" because "he has a shield" [30]. Health and sports intersect with a report that "Boston Children's Hospital Magazine touted Nike-funded youth athlete study" [86]. Political humor has also made headlines, with "Bill Maher prais[ing] pro-Trump comedian for Puerto Rico joke that set off liberal uproar" [107]. Finally, satirical content appears with a headline stating "Trump accepts generous gift of Imperial-Class Star Destroyer from Emperor Palpatine" [114], an obvious fiction referencing "Star Wars" characters and spacecraft.

After careful review, I made the following revisions to the original draft:

1. Removed speculative language about Pope Leo XIV, noting only what the headline states without adding contextual explanation about papal succession.

2. Added more careful phrasing regarding the alleged 2024 arson in Poland, clarifying that Poland blamed the Kremlin rather than stating definitively that the arson occurred.

3. Removed interpretive language about "Trump's war" against Harvard, sticking strictly to what the headline states.

4. Ensured all summaries directly reflect the headline content without adding speculation or connections not explicitly stated.

5. Double-checked all cited news IDs to ensure accurate attribution.

6. Adjusted some phrasing to maintain a factual, non-partisan tone throughout.

These revisions help ensure the document remains factual and objective without hallucinations or unsupported interpretations.

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# DAILY BRIEFING: MAY 2025

## AREA 1: TRUMP ADMINISTRATION & EXECUTIVE ACTIONS

### Healthcare and Drug Pricing Reforms
President Trump has signed what he described as "one of the most consequential executive orders in US history" targeting pharmaceutical pricing [1]. The order aims to slash drug prices by 30-80% [2] by implementing a "Favored Nations" requirement [3] that would match U.S. drug prices with those paid in other countries. The administration has established a 30-day deadline for pharmaceutical companies to comply [4]. Trump has directly challenged the pharmaceutical industry with this action [5], with some characterizing it as "going to war with Pharma" to ensure the country is "treated fairly" [6]. The Washington Post reportedly praised a Trump HHS report on pediatric surgeries, acknowledging it makes "a strong case for caution" regarding certain procedures [7].

### White House Operations and Personnel
The Trump administration has made personnel changes in federal cultural institutions, firing "the top US copyright official" shortly after terminating the Librarian of Congress [1]. The White House has added a "'new media' seat" at briefings, characterized as shaking up the "establishment" by providing an "alternative to 'archaic' press" [2]. In a confrontational exchange, President Trump publicly criticized an ABC reporter who questioned him about accepting a jet from Qatar, saying she "should be 'embarrassed'" [3].

### Border Enforcement and Statistics
Recent data from Customs and Border Protection indicates a dramatic reduction in southern border apprehensions, with numbers falling "more than 90% from year ago in April" [1].

A "first group of 49 white South Africans" has departed for the United States following President Trump's decision to offer them refugee status [1]. The Department of Homeland Security has issued subpoenas to California, investigating "possible cash benefits to illegals" [2]. A legal expert has highlighted the importance of a "centuries-old law" described as "crucial" for the administration's immigration enforcement position [3]. The Episcopal Church has reportedly ended its "federal refugee partnership because of 'moral opposition' to Trump resettling white South Africans" [4], citing its "racial justice commitment" as the basis for this decision.

A significant diplomatic breakthrough occurred with the release of Edan Alexander, described as "the last living American hostage" held by Hamas, after more than 580 days in captivity [1].

This development comes amid broader shifts in U.S. Middle East policy, including the conclusion of a "4th round of US-Iran talks" as Trump prepares for what's characterized as a "historic Middle East tour" [3]. These diplomatic initiatives appear to be creating tension with traditional allies, with reports indicating Trump is "straining relationship with Netanyahu" as his policies "increasingly isolate Israel" [4]. Qatar has reportedly offered Trump a "jumbo jet to serve as Air Force One" [5], described elsewhere as a "$400M Luxury Jet 'gift'" [6], which has prompted scrutiny and calls for an ethics investigation [7].

## AREA 4: ECONOMIC POLICY & GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY

### Trade Agreements and Tariffs
The United States and China have reached a temporary agreement to reduce tariffs for a 90-day period following trade negotiations [1]. This development has had a positive effect on financial markets, with the "Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq" all jumping in response to the news [2]. Some analysts suggest this trade truce could potentially "pump up president's poll numbers" [3]. Both countries have released specifics of the arrangement to "dramatically slash tariffs" [4].

Addressing long-term financial sustainability concerns, the Social Security commissioner has outlined a plan to "save agency from insolvency" [3]. Goldman Sachs has issued a warning about potential "economic repercussions" from "undermining central bank independence" [4]. Technology regulation appears to be increasing, with the U.S. enacting legislation to "force geo-tracking tech for high-end gaming and AI GPUs" [5].

## AREA 5: LEGAL SYSTEM & LAW ENFORCEMENT

### Judicial Rulings on Administration Policies
The Trump administration is engaged in several legal battles over its policies, with mixed outcomes in the courts. A federal judge's order requiring the administration to "return [a] deported migrant" has been "temporarily halted on appeal" [1]. Some media coverage has characterized certain judges as "'activist' judges" who are attempting to "curb Trump's agenda" [2]. In a favorable outcome for the administration, one report states that a "court rules in favor of Trump admin in DHS, IRS case" [3].

In Kentucky, an "'extremely paranoid' sheriff" was "questioned by police moments after judge's fatal shooting" [3]. A "viral Coast Guard video" has captured public attention by showing a "dramatic arrest of suspected drug smugglers in open ocean" [4].

## AREA 6: POLITICAL OPPOSITION & 2028 ELECTIONS

### Democratic Party Strategy and Congressional Response
Multiple reports highlight challenges facing the Democratic Party. Democratic Senate candidates in competitive "toss-up" states are reportedly co-sponsoring legislation that critics characterize as seeking to "eliminate women's sports" [1]. Economic credibility concerns have emerged with one report claiming the "Labor Department admits hundreds of thousands of Biden jobs were fake" [2]. Regarding the 2028 election, Representative Jasmine Crockett has reportedly suggested that Democrats are considering running the "safest White boy" as their candidate [3].

Congress is actively responding to various administration initiatives. The administration's legislative package, referred to as Trump's "big, beautiful bill," includes "Medicaid work requirements" [4] and will have "no millionaire tax hike" [5]. On immigration, Trump's "$1,000 self-deportation plan" has reportedly drawn "mixed reaction from House GOP" with some members stating "I don't love it" [6].

### Transportation Issues and Political Media
Transportation infrastructure issues have emerged at Newark Airport, with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer calling on "Secretary Duffy to 'immediately fix' Newark Airport situation" [1]. An aviation CEO discussed the "Newark airport chaos" and recommended "less flights and more recruitment" [2] to address the problems. Transportation Secretary Duffy has reportedly called for an "investigation after latest Newark airport ground delay" and "blames Biden admin for failures" [3].

Political messaging and media relations remain contentious. Former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki reportedly conducted a "mock press briefing trashing 'MAGA spin'" on White House questions [4]. President Trump has referred to Democrats as "'World Class Losers' for Fighting Free Air Force One" [5], likely referring to criticism of the Qatar aircraft offer.

## AREA 7: SOCIAL & CULTURAL ISSUES

### Education and Religious Organizations
The Oklahoma Legislature has "easily" passed legislation to "prohibit DEI [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion] in public higher education" [1]. At the elite university level, one analysis suggests "Harvard, you've got a problem," while simultaneously arguing that "Donald Trump's war will backfire" [2]. "Clergy members" have reportedly "descend[ed] on Newark ICE facility" and stated "they won't move until they are arrested" [3]. A headline references "The Decivilizing of America" and claims the country is "shedding the hard-won pillars of civilization—by choice, not chance—in a sweeping, top-down descent into disorder" [4].

## AREA 7: SOCIAL & CULTURAL ISSUES

### Education and Religious Issues
The Oklahoma Legislature has "easily" passed legislation to "prohibit DEI [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion] in public higher education" [1]. At the elite university level, one analysis suggests "Harvard, you've got a problem," while simultaneously arguing that "Donald Trump's war will backfire" [2].

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# DAILY BRIEFING: MAY 2025

## AREA 1: TRUMP ADMINISTRATION & EXECUTIVE ACTIONS

### Healthcare and Drug Pricing Reforms
President Trump has signed what he described as "one of the most consequential executive orders in US history" targeting pharmaceutical pricing [1]. The order aims to slash drug prices by 30-80% [2] by implementing a "Favored Nations" requirement [3] that would match U.S. drug prices with those paid in other countries. The administration has established a 30-day deadline for pharmaceutical companies to comply [4]. Trump has directly challenged the pharmaceutical industry with this action, with some characterizing it as "going to war with Pharma" to ensure the country is "treated fairly" [5]. The Washington Post reportedly praised a Trump HHS report on pediatric surgeries, acknowledging it makes "a strong case for caution" regarding certain procedures [6].

### White House Operations and Personnel
The Trump administration has made personnel changes in federal cultural institutions, firing "the top US copyright official" shortly after terminating the Librarian of Congress [1]. The White House has added a "'new media' seat" at briefings, characterized as shaking up the "establishment" by providing an "alternative to 'archaic' press" [2]. In a confrontational exchange, President Trump publicly criticized an ABC reporter who questioned him about accepting a jet from Qatar, saying she "should be 'embarrassed'" [3].

## AREA 2: IMMIGRATION & BORDER SECURITY

### Border Enforcement and Statistics
Recent data from Customs and Border Protection indicates a dramatic reduction in southern border apprehensions, with numbers falling "more than 90% from year ago in April" [1]. In a separate border security measure, the U.S. has temporarily closed the southern border to livestock imports to prevent the spread of "deadly flies" [2]. The Mayor of Nashville has signed an executive order establishing an "early warning system for immigration enforcement operations" [3].

### ICE Operations and Deportations
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has conducted several significant enforcement operations. A major sweep in Houston resulted in the arrest of 422 illegal migrants, including individuals reportedly wanted for serious crimes including murder and arson [1]. DHS accused a Massachusetts city council member of having "incited chaos" during ICE's arrest of what the agency described as a "violent criminal alien" [2]. ICE also apprehended an MS-13 gang member with visible gang tattoos who had reportedly been deported nearly two decades ago and subsequently reentered the United States illegally [3].

### Refugee and Legal Challenges
A "first group of 49 white South Africans" has departed for the United States following President Trump's decision to offer them refugee status [1]. The Department of Homeland Security has issued subpoenas to California, investigating "possible cash benefits to illegals" [2]. A legal expert has highlighted a "centuries-old law" described as "crucial" for the administration's immigration enforcement position [3]. The Episcopal Church has reportedly ended its "federal refugee partnership because of 'moral opposition' to Trump resettling white South Africans" [4], citing its "racial justice commitment" as the basis for this decision.

A significant diplomatic breakthrough occurred with the release of Edan Alexander, described as "the last living American hostage" held by Hamas, after more than 580 days in captivity [1]. President Trump had previously announced Alexander would be "coming home" [2]. This development comes amid broader shifts in U.S. Middle East policy, including the conclusion of a "4th round of US-Iran talks" as Trump prepares for what's characterized as a "historic Middle East tour" [3]. These diplomatic initiatives appear to be creating tension with traditional allies, with reports indicating Trump is "straining relationship with Netanyahu" as his policies "increasingly isolate Israel" [4]. Qatar has reportedly offered Trump a "jumbo jet to serve as Air Force One" [5], described elsewhere as a "$400M Luxury Jet 'gift'" [6], which has prompted a House Democrat to call for an "immediate ethics probe" [7].

## AREA 4: ECONOMIC POLICY & GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY

### Trade and Budget
The United States and China have reached a temporary agreement to reduce tariffs for a 90-day period following trade negotiations [1]. This development has had a positive effect on financial markets, with the "Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq" all jumping in response [2]. Both countries have released specifics of the arrangement to "dramatically slash tariffs" [3]. The Trump administration's 2026 budget proposal reportedly "pulls the plug on Biden's Green Energy Scams" [4] and has reportedly "slowed national debt growth by 92%" [5]. Addressing long-term financial sustainability concerns, the Social Security commissioner has outlined a plan to "save agency from insolvency" [6].

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

DAILY BRIEFING: MAY 2025

AREA 1: TRUMP ADMINISTRATION & EXECUTIVE ACTIONS

Healthcare and Drug Pricing Reforms  
President Trump has signed what he described as "one of the most consequential executive orders in US history" targeting pharmaceutical pricing [1]. The order aims to slash drug prices by 30-80% [2] by implementing a "Favored Nations" requirement [3] that would match U.S. drug prices with those paid in other countries. The administration has established a 30-day deadline for pharmaceutical companies to comply [4]. Trump has directly challenged the pharmaceutical industry with this action, with some characterizing it as "going to war with Pharma" to ensure the country is "treated fairly" [5]. The Washington Post reportedly praised a Trump HHS report on pediatric surgeries, acknowledging it makes "a strong case for caution" regarding certain procedures [6].

────────────────────────────────────────────
White House Operations and Personnel  
The Trump administration has made personnel changes in federal cultural institutions, firing "the top US copyright official" shortly after terminating the Librarian of Congress [1]. The White House has added a "'new media' seat" at briefings, characterized as shaking up the "establishment" by providing an "alternative to 'archaic' press" [2]. In a confrontational exchange, President Trump publicly criticized an ABC reporter who questioned him about accepting a jet from Qatar, saying she "should be 'embarrassed'" [3].

────────────────────────────────────────────
AREA 2: IMMIGRATION & BORDER SECURITY

Border Enforcement and Statistics  
Recent data from Customs and Border Protection indicates a dramatic reduction in southern border apprehensions, with numbers falling "more than 90% from year ago in April" [1]. In a separate border security measure, the U.S. has temporarily closed the southern border to livestock imports to prevent the spread of "deadly flies" [2]. The Mayor of Nashville has signed an executive order establishing an "early warning system for immigration enforcement operations" [3].

────────────────────────────────────────────
ICE Operations and Deportations  
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has conducted several significant enforcement operations. A major sweep in Houston resulted in the arrest of 422 illegal migrants, including individuals reportedly wanted for serious crimes including murder and arson [1]. DHS accused a Massachusetts city council member of having "incited chaos" during ICE's arrest of what the agency described as a "violent criminal alien" [2]. ICE also apprehended an MS-13 gang member with visible gang tattoos who had reportedly been deported nearly two decades ago and subsequently reentered the United States illegally [3].

────────────────────────────────────────────
Refugee and Legal Challenges  
A "first group of 49 white South Africans" has departed for the United States following President Trump's decision to offer them refugee status [1]. The Department of Homeland Security has issued subpoenas to California, investigating "possible cash benefits to illegals" [2]. A legal expert has highlighted a "centuries-old law" described as "crucial" for the administration's immigration enforcement position [3]. The Episcopal Church has reportedly ended its "federal refugee partnership because of 'moral opposition' to Trump resettling white South Africans" [4], citing its "racial justice commitment" as the basis for this decision.

────────────────────────────────────────────
AREA 3: FOREIGN POLICY & INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS

Middle East Diplomacy and Hostage Situations  
A significant diplomatic breakthrough occurred with the release of Edan Alexander, described as "the last living American hostage" held by Hamas, after more than 580 days in captivity [1]. President Trump had previously announced Alexander would be "coming home" [2]. This development comes amid broader shifts in U.S. Middle East policy, including the conclusion of a "4th round of US-Iran talks" as Trump prepares for what's characterized as a "historic Middle East tour" [3]. These diplomatic initiatives appear to be creating tension with traditional allies, with reports indicating Trump is "straining relationship with Netanyahu" as his policies "increasingly isolate Israel" [4]. Qatar has reportedly offered Trump a "jumbo jet to serve as Air Force One" [5], described elsewhere as a "$400M Luxury Jet 'gift'" [6], which has prompted a House Democrat to call for an "immediate ethics probe" [7].

President Trump has announced that China has agreed to "fully open" its markets to U.S. businesses [1]. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has indicated his willingness to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Turkey [2]. Poland has ordered the closure of the Russian consulate in Krakow, blaming the Kremlin for an arson incident that allegedly occurred in 2024 [3]. U.S. intelligence agencies have reportedly been directed to increase surveillance activities focused on Greenland, as "Trump mulls takeover" of the autonomous Danish territory [4]. The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has announced plans to "disband after four-decade insurgency against Turkey" [5].

AREA 4: ECONOMIC POLICY & GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY

Trade and Budget  
The United States and China have reached a temporary agreement to reduce tariffs for a 90-day period following trade negotiations [1]. This development has had a positive effect on financial markets, with the "Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq" all jumping in response [2]. Both countries have released specifics of the arrangement to "dramatically slash tariffs" [3]. The Trump administration's 2026 budget proposal reportedly "pulls the plug on Biden's Green Energy Scams" [4] and has reportedly "slowed national debt growth by 92%" [5]. Addressing long-term financial sustainability concerns, the Social Security commissioner has outlined a plan to "save agency from insolvency" [6].

Goldman Sachs has issued a warning about potential "economic repercussions" from "undermining central bank independence" [1].

AREA 5: LEGAL SYSTEM & CONGRESSIONAL ACTIVITY

Judicial Rulings and Administration Policies  
The Trump administration is engaged in several legal battles over its policies. A federal judge's order requiring the administration to "return [a] deported migrant" has been "temporarily halted on appeal" [1]. Some media coverage has characterized certain judges as "'activist' judges" who are attempting to "curb Trump's agenda" [2]. In a favorable outcome for the administration, one report states that a "court rules in favor of Trump admin in DHS, IRS case" [3].

────────────────────────────────────────────
Congressional Response  
Congress is actively responding to various administration initiatives. The administration's legislative package, referred to as Trump's "big, beautiful bill," includes "Medicaid work requirements" [1] and will have "no millionaire tax hike" [2]. On immigration, Trump's "$1,000 self-deportation plan" has reportedly drawn "mixed reaction from House GOP" with some members stating "I don't love it" [3]. A "GOP senator" has introduced a bill with "severe consequences for harming police," saying "enough is enough" [4].

AREA 6: TRANSPORTATION AND POLITICAL OPPOSITION

Newark Airport Crisis  
Transportation infrastructure issues have emerged at Newark Airport, with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer calling on "Secretary Duffy to 'immediately fix' Newark Airport situation" [1]. An aviation CEO discussed the "Newark airport chaos" and recommended "less flights and more recruitment" [2] to address the problems. Transportation Secretary Duffy has reportedly called for an "investigation after latest Newark airport ground delay" and "blames Biden admin for failures" [3].

────────────────────────────────────────────
Democratic Party Challenges  
Multiple reports highlight challenges facing the Democratic Party. Democratic Senate candidates in competitive "toss-up" states are reportedly co-sponsoring legislation that critics characterize as seeking to "eliminate women's sports" [1]. Economic credibility concerns have emerged with one report claiming the "Labor Department admits hundreds of thousands of Biden jobs were fake" [2]. Regarding the 2028 election, Representative Jasmine Crockett has reportedly suggested that Democrats are considering running the "safest White boy" as their candidate [3]. Former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki reportedly conducted a "mock press briefing trashing 'MAGA spin'" on White House questions [4].

AREA 7: SOCIAL & CULTURAL ISSUES

Education and Religious Issues  
The Oklahoma Legislature has "easily" passed legislation to "prohibit DEI [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion] in public higher education" [1]. At the elite university level, one analysis suggests "Harvard, you've got a problem," while simultaneously arguing that "Donald Trump's war will backfire" [2]. "Clergy members" have reportedly "descend[ed] on Newark ICE facility" and stated "they won't move until they are arrested" [3].

Crime and Law Enforcement  
An MS-13 gang member with the nickname "Antichrist" has received a 55-year sentence for what's described as a "savage quadruple machete massacre in Long Island park" [1]. Urban crime has reached congressional staff, with reports of a "House staffer" becoming a "victim of armed carjacking in popular Washington neighborhood" [2]. A "viral Coast Guard video" has captured public attention by showing a "dramatic arrest of suspected drug smugglers in open ocean" [3].

DAILY BRIEFING: MAY 2025

AREA 1: TRUMP ADMINISTRATION & EXECUTIVE ACTIONS

Healthcare and Drug Pricing Reforms  
President Trump has signed what he described as "one of the most consequential executive orders in US history" targeting pharmaceutical pricing [1]. The order aims to slash drug prices by 30-80% [2] by implementing a "Favored Nations" requirement [3] that would match U.S. drug prices with those paid in other countries. The administration has established a 30-day deadline for pharmaceutical companies to comply [4]. Trump has directly challenged the pharmaceutical industry with this action, with some characterizing it as "going to war with Pharma" to ensure the country is "treated fairly" [5]. The Washington Post reportedly praised a Trump HHS report on pediatric surgeries, acknowledging it makes "a strong case for caution" regarding certain procedures [6].

White House Operations and Personnel  
The Trump administration has made personnel changes in federal cultural institutions, firing "the top US copyright official" shortly after terminating the Librarian of Congress [1]. The White House has added a "'new media' seat" at briefings, characterized as shaking up the "establishment" by providing an "alternative to 'archaic' press" [2]. In a confrontational exchange, President Trump publicly criticized an ABC reporter who questioned him about accepting a jet from Qatar, saying she "should be 'embarrassed'" [3].

AREA 2: IMMIGRATION & BORDER SECURITY

Border Enforcement and Statistics  
Recent data from Customs and Border Protection indicates a dramatic reduction in southern border apprehensions, with numbers falling "more than 90% from year ago in April" [1]. In a separate border security measure, the U.S. has temporarily closed the southern border to livestock imports to prevent the spread of "deadly flies" [2]. The Mayor of Nashville has signed an executive order establishing an "early warning system for immigration enforcement operations" [3].

────────────────────────────────────────────
ICE Operations and Deportations  
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has conducted several significant enforcement operations. A major sweep in Houston resulted in the arrest of 422 illegal migrants, including individuals reportedly wanted for serious crimes including murder and arson [1]. DHS accused a Massachusetts city council member of having "incited chaos" during ICE's arrest of what the agency described as a "violent criminal alien" [2]. ICE also apprehended an MS-13 gang member with visible gang tattoos who had reportedly been deported nearly two decades ago and subsequently reentered the United States illegally [3].

────────────────────────────────────────────
Refugee and Legal Challenges  
A "first group of 49 white South Africans" has departed for the United States following President Trump's decision to offer them refugee status [1]. The Department of Homeland Security has issued subpoenas to California, investigating "possible cash benefits to illegals" [2]. A legal expert has highlighted a "centuries-old law" described as "crucial" for the administration's immigration enforcement position [3]. The Episcopal Church has reportedly ended its "federal refugee partnership because of 'moral opposition' to Trump resettling white South Africans" [4], citing its "racial justice commitment" as the basis for this decision.

AREA 3: FOREIGN POLICY & INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS

Middle East Diplomacy and Hostage Situations  
A significant diplomatic breakthrough occurred with the release of Edan Alexander, described as "the last living American hostage" held by Hamas, after more than 580 days in captivity [1]. President Trump had previously announced Alexander would be "coming home" [2]. This development comes amid broader shifts in U.S. Middle East policy, including the conclusion of a "4th round of US-Iran talks" as Trump prepares for what's characterized as a "historic Middle East tour" [3]. These diplomatic initiatives appear to be creating tension with traditional allies, with reports indicating Trump is "straining relationship with Netanyahu" as his policies "increasingly isolate Israel" [4]. Qatar has reportedly offered Trump a "jumbo jet to serve as Air Force One" [5], described elsewhere as a "$400M Luxury Jet 'gift'" [6], which has prompted a House Democrat to call for an "immediate ethics probe" [7].

AREA 5: LEGAL SYSTEM & CONGRESSIONAL ACTIVITY

Judicial Rulings and Administration Policies  
The Trump administration is engaged in several legal battles over its policies. A federal judge's order requiring the administration to "return [a] deported migrant" has been "temporarily halted on appeal" [1]. Some media coverage has characterized certain judges as "'activist' judges" who are attempting to "curb Trump's agenda" [2].

The administration's legislative package, referred to as Trump's "big, beautiful bill," includes "Medicaid work requirements" [1] and will have "no millionaire tax hike" [2]. On immigration, Trump's "$1,000 self-deportation plan" has reportedly drawn "mixed reaction from House GOP" with some members stating "I don't love it" [3]. A "GOP senator" has introduced a bill with "severe consequences for harming police," saying "enough is enough" [4].

Multiple reports highlight challenges facing the Democratic Party. Democratic Senate candidates in competitive "toss-up" states are reportedly co-sponsoring legislation that critics characterize as seeking to "eliminate women's sports" [1]. Economic credibility concerns have emerged with one report claiming the "Labor Department admits hundreds of thousands of Biden jobs were fake" [2]. Regarding the 2028 election, Representative Jasmine Crockett has reportedly suggested that Democrats are considering running the "safest White boy" as their candidate [3].

Education and Religious Issues  
The Oklahoma Legislature has "easily" passed legislation to "prohibit DEI [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion] in public higher education" [1].

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!

The administration has established a 30-day deadline for pharmaceutical companies to comply [4]. Trump has directly challenged the pharmaceutical industry with this action, with some characterizing it as "going to war with Pharma" to ensure the country is "treated fairly" [5].

## 2. Immigration and Border Security

### 2.1 Border Enforcement and Statistics
Recent data from Customs and Border Protection indicates a dramatic reduction in southern border apprehensions, with numbers falling "more than 90% from year ago in April" [1]. In a separate border security measure, the U.S. has temporarily closed the southern border to livestock imports to prevent the spread of "deadly flies" [2]. The Mayor of Nashville has signed an executive order establishing an "early warning system for immigration enforcement operations" [3].

### 2.2 ICE Operations and Deportations
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has conducted several significant enforcement operations. A major sweep in Houston resulted in the arrest of 422 illegal migrants, including individuals reportedly wanted for serious crimes including murder and arson [1]. DHS accused a Massachusetts city council member of having "incited chaos" during ICE's arrest of what the agency described as a "violent criminal alien" [2]. ICE also apprehended an MS-13 gang member with visible gang tattoos who had reportedly been deported nearly two decades ago and subsequently reentered the United States illegally [3].

### 2.3 Refugee and Legal Challenges
A "first group of 49 white South Africans" has departed for the United States following President Trump's decision to offer them refugee status [1]. The Department of Homeland Security has issued subpoenas to California, investigating "possible cash benefits to illegals" [2]. A legal expert has highlighted a "centuries-old law" described as "crucial" for the administration's immigration enforcement position [3]. The Episcopal Church has reportedly ended its "federal refugee partnership because of 'moral opposition' to Trump resettling white South Africans" [4], citing its "racial justice commitment" as the basis for this decision.

## 3. Foreign Policy and International Relations

### 3.1 Middle East Diplomacy and Hostage Situations
A significant diplomatic breakthrough occurred with the release of Edan Alexander, described as "the last living American hostage" held by Hamas, after more than 580 days in captivity [1]. President Trump had previously announced Alexander would be "coming home" [2]. This development comes amid broader shifts in U.S. Middle East policy, including the conclusion of a "4th round of US-Iran talks" as Trump prepares for what's characterized as a "historic Middle East tour" [3]. These diplomatic initiatives appear to be creating tension with traditional allies, with reports indicating Trump is "straining relationship with Netanyahu" as his policies "increasingly isolate Israel" [4]. Qatar has reportedly offered Trump a "jumbo jet to serve as Air Force One" [5], described elsewhere as a "$400M Luxury Jet 'gift'" [6], which has prompted a House Democrat to call for an "immediate ethics probe" [7].

## 4. Economic Policy and Government Efficiency

### 4.1 Trade and Budget
The United States and China have reached a temporary agreement to reduce tariffs for a 90-day period following trade negotiations [1]. This development has had a positive effect on financial markets, with the "Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq" all jumping in response [2]. Both countries have released specifics of the arrangement to "dramatically slash tariffs" [3]. The Trump administration's 2026 budget proposal reportedly "pulls the plug on Biden's Green Energy Scams" [4] and has reportedly "slowed national debt growth by 92%" [5]. Addressing long-term financial sustainability concerns, the Social Security commissioner has outlined a plan to "save agency from insolvency" [6].

### 4.2 Financial and Technology Regulation
Goldman Sachs has issued a warning about potential "economic repercussions" from "undermining central bank independence" [1].

## 5. Legal System and Congressional Activity

### 5.1 Judicial Rulings and Administration Policies
The Trump administration is engaged in several legal battles over its policies. A federal judge's order requiring the administration to "return [a] deported migrant" has been "temporarily halted on appeal" [1]. Some media coverage has characterized certain judges as "'activist' judges" who are attempting to "curb Trump's agenda" [2]. In a favorable outcome for the administration, one report states that a "court rules in favor of Trump admin in DHS, IRS case" [3].

### 5.2 Congressional Response
Congress is actively responding to various administration initiatives. The administration's legislative package, referred to as Trump's "big, beautiful bill," includes "Medicaid work requirements" [1] and will have "no millionaire tax hike" [2]. On immigration, Trump's "$1,000 self-deportation plan" has reportedly drawn "mixed reaction from House GOP" with some members stating "I don't love it" [3]. A "GOP senator" has introduced a bill with "severe consequences for harming police," saying "enough is enough" [4].

## 6. Transportation and Political Opposition

### 6.1 Newark Airport Crisis
Transportation infrastructure issues have emerged at Newark Airport, with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer calling on "Secretary Duffy to 'immediately fix' Newark Airport situation" [1]. An aviation CEO discussed the "Newark airport chaos" and recommended "less flights and more recruitment" [2] to address the problems. Transportation Secretary Duffy has reportedly called for an "investigation after latest Newark airport ground delay" and "blames Biden admin for failures" [3].

### 6.2 Democratic Party Challenges
Multiple reports highlight challenges facing the Democratic Party. Democratic Senate candidates in competitive "toss-up" states are reportedly co-sponsoring legislation that critics characterize as seeking to "eliminate women's sports" [1]. Economic credibility concerns have emerged with one report claiming the "Labor Department admits hundreds of thousands of Biden jobs were fake" [2]. Regarding the 2028 election, Representative Jasmine Crockett has reportedly suggested that Democrats are considering running the "safest White boy" as their candidate [3]. Former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki reportedly conducted a "mock press briefing trashing 'MAGA spin'" on White House questions [4].

## 7. Social and Cultural Issues

### 7.1 Education and Religious Issues
The Oklahoma Legislature has "easily" passed legislation to "prohibit DEI [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion] in public higher education" [1]. At the elite university level, one analysis suggests "Harvard, you've got a problem," while simultaneously arguing that "Donald Trump's war will backfire" [2]. "Clergy members" have reportedly "descend[ed] on Newark ICE facility" and stated "they won't move until they are arrested" [3].

### 7.2 Crime and Law Enforcement
An MS-13 gang member with the nickname "Antichrist" has received a 55-year sentence for what's described as a "savage quadruple machete massacre in Long Island park" [1]. Urban crime has reached congressional staff, with reports of a "House staffer" becoming a "victim of armed carjacking in popular Washington neighborhood" [2]. A "viral Coast Guard video" has captured public attention by showing a "dramatic arrest of suspected drug smugglers in open ocean" [3].
