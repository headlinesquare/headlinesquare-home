## 1. Immigration and Border Policy

### 1.1 Deportation Actions and Legal Challenges

Lawyers for Abrego Garcia have requested a U.S. contempt hearing [3], while reports characterize the administration's approach to court orders as defiant [4]. Separately, a U.S. citizen reportedly received instructions from DHS to "immediately self-deport" [5], with questions raised about who the directive applies to and who received it [6].
