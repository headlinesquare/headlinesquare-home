**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch expanded their power dramatically, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025], and the tech czar Elon Musk [The founder and former head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)]. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. Now, Elon Musk is leaving his role as the head of DOGE, but his influence continues.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

====================Input File End======================

---

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL news lines from r/politics. I understand my role as Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress, creating an objective Daily Briefing based on these headlines.

I'll analyze the news carefully, recognizing that my internal knowledge is outdated and that I must rely exclusively on the information provided in your prompts. I'll follow the 8-step workflow with checks after each step, addressing one step per response.

I'll wait for you to provide the JSONL lines before beginning Step 1.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

====================

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.


====================
    Round 3
    Assistant: 
====================

# step1.txt (Updated)

Area 1: Trump Administration and Executive Actions
    Topic 1.1: Presidential Decisions and Policy Implementation
    Topic 1.2: Administration Appointments and Personnel
    Topic 1.3: Financial Disclosures and Ethics
    Topic 1.4: Executive Powers and Authority

Area 2: Public Response and Democratic Concerns
    Topic 2.1: "No Kings" Nationwide Protests
    Topic 2.2: Trump's Military Parade
    Topic 2.3: Police Response to Protesters
    Topic 2.4: Democracy and Autocracy Concerns

Area 3: Immigration Policy and Enforcement
    Topic 3.1: Immigration Raids and Enforcement Actions
    Topic 3.2: Policy Changes and Exceptions
    Topic 3.3: Individual Immigration Cases
    Topic 3.4: Economic and Social Impacts of Immigration Policies

Area 4: Foreign Policy and International Relations
    Topic 4.1: Israel-Iran Conflict
    Topic 4.2: US-Russia Relations
    Topic 4.3: Global Perception of US Leadership
    Topic 4.4: International Trade and Diplomacy

Area 5: Domestic Politics and Partisan Dynamics
    Topic 5.1: Democratic Party Developments
    Topic 5.2: Republican Party Positioning
    Topic 5.3: Political Violence and Extremism
    Topic 5.4: Partisan Divides on Policy Issues

Area 6: Legal, Regulatory, and Legislative Developments
    Topic 6.1: Supreme Court Decisions
    Topic 6.2: New Legislation and Regulatory Changes
    Topic 6.3: Legal Challenges to Government Actions
    Topic 6.4: Civil Rights and Discrimination Cases

Area 7: Economic and Environmental Policy
    Topic 7.1: Economic Forecasts and Financial Impacts
    Topic 7.2: Government Spending and Fiscal Policy
    Topic 7.3: Environmental and Energy Regulations
    Topic 7.4: Technology Policy and AI Governance

Revisions made:
1. Reorganized areas to place related topics closer together (Trump administration topics now adjacent to public response)
2. Renamed Area 1 and Area 2 to create a more logical flow from executive actions to public response
3. Refined topic descriptions to ensure all news articles have a clear category
4. Created a more intuitive progression from governance issues to policy areas to legal matters to economic issues
5. Made topic descriptions more specific to better capture the range of news stories


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Explanation of the Process and Assignments:
1. Each article’s headline was carefully reviewed in light of the seven major Areas and their Topics defined in Step 1.
2. For every article, a unique assignment was made to the Area that best reflected the main subject—whether it was about Trump’s executive actions, public protests and responses, immigration enforcement or related reforms, foreign policy conflicts, domestic partisan dynamics, legal/legislative decisions, or economic/environmental policy.
3. Some headlines with multiple facets were assigned by selecting the aspect that was most prominent in the title.
4. The resulting assignments preserve the original ascending order by article ID while clearly tagging each entry with its Area and Topic for further processing.

This completes Step 2.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions and Explanation:
1. All 71 records were rechecked and grouped uniquely by the 7 areas and the corresponding topics defined in Step 1.
2. Within each Area, articles are now organized under the appropriate Topic in numeric order (by topic code) based on the assignment from Step 2.
3. Any gaps (topics with no assigned records) have been omitted to maintain clarity.
4. Each JSON line is preserved exactly as provided, ensuring that no record was duplicated or omitted.

This completes the sorted grouping as required for further processing.

    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

──────────────────────────────

Revisions and Explanation:
1. I rechecked the grouping to confirm that every single article (IDs 1–71) appears exactly once.
2. I verified that each article is uniquely assigned to one Area and one Topic, with no duplicates or omissions.
3. Minor formatting adjustments were made for clarity and consistency in the file structure.

This completes the second check for Step 2.


====================
    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the final consolidated text file (step3.txt) with our importance scores inserted at the article, topic, and area levels. (All scores are on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 reserved for the very highest impact items. In each JSON article line the new field "importance" is added immediately after the "title".)

Explanation:
• Each article now carries an "importance" field (value between 1 and 10) based on the source credibility, headline clarity, and perceived relevance.
• Each topic has been assigned an overall importance score that reflects the combined weight and focus of its contained stories.
• Each area’s importance score was determined by the significance of the set of topics that fall under it in the current political environment.
• Care was taken not to overuse the highest scores while still highlighting impactful and newsworthy items.

This completes Step 3.


====================
    Round 8
    User: 
====================

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised step3.txt with updated importance scores. The changes made are:

• In Area 1, Topic 1.2 (“Administration Appointments and Personnel”) the topic’s importance was increased from 6 to 7—to better reflect that the single article (a CNN report on RFK Jr.’s vaccine advisers) is notable.
• In Area 7, Topic 7.1 (“Economic Forecasts and Financial Impacts”) the topic’s importance was raised from 6 to 7, to be consistent with the high importance (7) of its contained article.

All other importance scores remain unchanged based on our previous evaluation.

**Step 4 (logic-heavy)**

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

Explanation of Revisions:
1. I verified that areas are sorted in descending order by importance (8, then 7, then 6) while preserving original order among ties.
2. Within each area, topics were sorted by descending importance (with ties kept in the original order), and similarly for the articles within each topic.
3. Minor formatting improvements were applied for clarity while keeping all original information intact.

This completes the revised Step 4 file.

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 11
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the new step4.txt with updated ascending numbering for areas and topics. All articles remain unchanged and appear in precisely the same order as before. The only changes were to reassign the area and topic numbers in sequential order according to their appearance in the document.

Revisions Made:
1. Verified that every record appears uniquely and exhaustively across areas and topics.
2. Reassigned new ascending numbering for areas (from Area 1 through Area 7) based on their current order.
3. Within each area, renumbered the topics sequentially (e.g., for Area 2, topics are now 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4) while preserving the original content and order of articles.

This completes the updated step4.txt with the required numbering corrections.


====================
    Round 12
    User: 
====================

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Here's the completed step5.txt with topic summaries and relevant citations:

──────────────────────────────
Area 1: Trump Administration and Executive Actions (importance: 8)

  Topic 1.1: Presidential Decisions and Policy Implementation (importance: 7)
  
  President Trump's administration has implemented multiple significant policy changes in rapid succession, with states struggling to adapt to a broadband overhaul that reportedly compressed "two years of work into two months" [24]. The administration has also taken aggressive action against California, with reports indicating broad-based policy changes being implemented simultaneously [29]. Trump has emphasized his "America First" doctrine, asserting that the phrase's meaning is subject to his own interpretation [3]. Additional policy moves include the EPA dropping a case against private prison operator GEO Group regarding disinfectant misuse in ICE detention facilities [39], and consideration of expanding travel restrictions to potentially include 36 additional countries [61].

  Topic 1.2: Administration Appointments and Personnel (importance: 7)
  
  Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed new vaccine advisers who have drawn scrutiny. According to reports, these include an emergency room doctor who posted Islamophobic commentary online and individuals who have previously served as expert witnesses against vaccines [28].
  
  {"id": 28, "domain": "cnn.com", "title": "RFK Jr.'s new vaccine advisers include ER doctor who posted Islamophobic commentary online, expert witnesses against vaccines", "importance": 7}

  Topic 1.3: Financial Disclosures and Ethics (importance: 7)
  
  Financial disclosure reports indicate that President Trump reported more than $600 million in income derived from various sources including cryptocurrency, golf operations, and licensing fees [17]. This disclosure provides insight into the president's financial interests since returning to office.
  
  {"id": 17, "domain": "cnn.com", "title": "Trump reports more than $600 million in income from crypto, golf, licensing fees", "importance": 8}


Area 2: Public Response and Democratic Concerns (importance: 8)

  Topic 2.1: "No Kings" Nationwide Protests (importance: 8)
  
  Widespread "No Kings" protests against President Trump have emerged across the United States, with reports indicating participation by millions of Americans [4, 12, 27]. Major gatherings included over one million attendees at Boston Common for a combined Pride and No Kings rally [1], with demonstrations occurring in every state [2]. According to multiple reports, protest turnout "exceeded expectations" [21], though participation numbers varied by location, with thousands gathering at the Minnesota Capitol [31] and across Connecticut [7]. The protests broadly challenge what participants characterize as authoritarian tendencies in the current administration.

  Topic 2.2: Democracy and Autocracy Concerns (importance: 8)
  
  Protesters expressing opposition to President Trump have voiced concerns that he is "shredding our constitution, our government" [43]. Multiple commentaries have emerged arguing that in the United States, "the people rule, not wannabe King Trump" [54]. Additional perspectives include a historian who previously criticized billionaires for tax avoidance now calling for "moral ambition" to counter what they characterize as tyranny [56], and personal testimony from someone who experienced disappearance under Argentina's dictatorship warning about how autocracy begins [57].

  Topic 2.3: Trump's Military Parade (importance: 7)
  
  President Trump presided over a military parade with a reported cost of $45 million [34], which according to multiple reports was met with "empty seats" [15] and an "underwhelming crowd" [34, 64]. Coverage contrasts were evident, as Fox News hosts reportedly "gushed over the parade, with no protests in sight" [30], while other outlets characterized the event as a "gross failure" [36]. The parade coincided with widespread "No Kings" protests occurring nationwide [64].

In creating these summaries, I focused on providing factual, non-partisan analysis based strictly on the information contained in the headlines. For each topic, I synthesized the main points from related articles, using direct quotes from headlines where appropriate and citing the specific article IDs as references.

I was careful to avoid speculation, editorializing, or adding information not present in the headlines. When headlines contained insufficient information, I explicitly noted this limitation rather than filling gaps with assumptions. I maintained an urgent, concrete tone focused on the facts while avoiding generic phrasing.

I also performed careful fact-checking to prevent any hallucinations, ensuring that all events, names, and quotes came directly from the headline information provided. The summaries reflect the relative importance of articles within each topic, with higher-importance articles receiving more coverage in the summaries.

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

──────────────────────────────

After carefully reviewing my work, I made the following revisions:

1. In Area 1, Topic 1.3 (Financial Disclosures and Ethics): Removed an unsupported inference about Trump "since returning to office" as this wasn't explicitly stated in the headline.

2. In Area 2, Topic 2.1 ("No Kings" Nationwide Protests): Removed an unsupported characterization about protests challenging "authoritarian tendencies" since this interpretation wasn't explicitly stated in the headlines.

The revisions ensure that all summaries strictly adhere to the information contained in the headlines without adding any speculation, unsupported interpretations, or hallucinations. Each summary now directly reflects only what is explicitly stated in the news headlines, with proper citations to the source IDs for verification.


====================
    Round 14
    User: 
====================

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

## 1. Trump Administration and Executive Actions

### 1.1 Presidential Decisions and Policy Implementation

President Trump's administration has implemented multiple significant policy changes in rapid succession.

Trump has emphasized his "America First" doctrine, asserting that the phrase's meaning is subject to his own interpretation [3]. Additional policy moves include the EPA dropping a case against private prison operator GEO Group regarding disinfectant misuse in ICE detention facilities [4], and consideration of expanding travel restrictions to potentially include 36 additional countries [5].

Protesters expressing opposition to President Trump have voiced concerns that he is "shredding our constitution, our government" [15].

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

====================

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

1. Trump Administration and Executive Actions

1.1 Presidential Decisions and Policy Implementation

President Trump's administration has implemented multiple significant policy changes in rapid succession. States are struggling to adapt to a broadband overhaul that reportedly compressed "two years of work into two months" [1]. The administration has also taken aggressive action against California, with reports indicating broad-based policy changes being implemented simultaneously [2]. Trump has emphasized his "America First" doctrine, asserting that the phrase's meaning is subject to his own interpretation [3]. Additionally, the EPA dropped a case against private prison operator GEO Group regarding disinfectant misuse in ICE detention facilities [4].

2.2 Democracy and Autocracy Concerns

Protesters expressing opposition to President Trump have voiced concerns that he is "shredding our constitution, our government" [1]. Multiple commentaries have emerged arguing that in the United States, "the people rule, not wannabe King Trump" [2].

President Trump presided over a military parade with a reported cost of $45 million [1], which according to multiple reports was met with "empty seats" [2] and an "underwhelming crowd" [1, 3]. Coverage contrasts were evident, as Fox News hosts reportedly "gushed over the parade, with no protests in sight" [4]. The parade coincided with widespread "No Kings" protests occurring nationwide [3].

3. Foreign Policy and International Relations

3.1 Israel-Iran Conflict

Israel and Iran have exchanged military strikes amid statements from President Trump that the conflict "should end" and "can be easily ended" [1, 2]. The situation has grown more complex with reports that Israel has asked the US to participate in strikes on Iran's nuclear sites [3], while Trump has threatened Iran with "retaliation at levels never seen before" [4]. Analysis suggests Netanyahu has "outplayed Trump on Iran," potentially pulling the US into broader conflict [5].

3.2 Global Perception of US Leadership

Reports indicate that "majorities in key U.S. allies have no confidence in Trump's global leadership" [1], suggesting diplomatic challenges for the administration. Analysis suggests that "Donald Trump is losing control of American foreign policy" [2] and that his administration has "wrecked America's brand" internationally [3].

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!
