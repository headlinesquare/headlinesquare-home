## 2. Executive Branch Authority

### 2.1 Federal Workforce Restructuring
President Trump has moved to invoke "Schedule F," a classification that would remove civil service protections and make it easier to fire federal workers [1][2]. This executive action would reclassify "wide swaths" of the federal workforce [3], potentially affecting thousands of government employees.

House Democrats have raised concerns that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is building a "master database" of Americans' sensitive information [1]. Personnel changes continue across agencies, with the Kennedy Center firing more staff [2], an acting IRS commissioner replaced after just three days as a senior DOGE official loses access [3], and the National Security Council being rebuilt with aides aligned with the "MAGA agenda" [4]. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division is implementing what the New York Times describes as Trump's "culture war agenda" [5].
