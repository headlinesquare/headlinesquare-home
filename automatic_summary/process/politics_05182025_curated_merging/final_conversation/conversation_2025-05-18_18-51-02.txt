**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

---

Because there are several hundreds of news articles posted in some subreddit communities every day, it is hard to summarize all of them in a single process. Fortunately, I have already broken the articles in that day into chunks by submission time in the 24 hour coverage window in ascending order, and generated summaries for each chunk with LLMs. Those detailed summary chunks will be posted here. Each has a length of 1300-1700 words without counting the URLs, and citing 30-50 news articles. 

The chunks are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, there are 4 chunks, and the news coverage cycle is from yesterday's 18:00 to today's 18:00. Chunk 1 is from the articles submitted between 18:00 of yesterday to 06:00 of today, Chunk 2 is for 06:00 to 10:00 today, Chunk 3 is for 10:00 to 14:00 today, and Chunk 4 is from 14:00 to 18:00 today. The first chunk is based on the earliest articles submitted to the subreddit community. The last chunk is based on the latest articles submitted. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in Chunk 2 **happen** after all the news stories in Chunk 1, just because they are **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from Chunk 1 and B from Chunk 2, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This rule applies to all chunks in sequential order. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from different chunks. 

**Your task is to critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks, and then faithfully merge all of them into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks.** 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

---

Please tell me if you are ready to receive the individual summaries. I will provide them all at once. And please follow my later instructions, be patient, do the work step by step.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the individual summaries. I'll analyze them carefully and merge them into a comprehensive Daily Briefing that both Democratic and Republican leadership can use to understand the current situation objectively. I understand that factual accuracy is paramount, and I'll rely solely on the provided information rather than my outdated internal knowledge.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1**

Comparing:

Please critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks provided below. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You must use your limited length to summarize the most important news, while skipping the secondary.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.

Please carefully think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. **You will do the merging task in the next round with my detailed instructions. Please do not attempt to write down your summary at this step, because you haven't been given the full instructions yet!** It is always better to take some time to think clearly for such a difficult task, and make detailed plans for yourself, before taking any actions. You should use this opportunity to prepare yourself for your next round of work by writing down some notes for yourself.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Federal Justice and Constitutional Issues

### 1.1 Supreme Court-Executive Branch Tensions
President Trump's administration is heading toward a constitutional confrontation with the judiciary over separation of powers [1][2]. The flashpoint centers on the Supreme Court's ruling blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, which Trump has endorsed the idea is "illegal" [3]. The president has directly suggested the Court is "illegally" blocking what some characterize as "lawless deportations" [4], marking an extraordinary challenge to judicial authority from the executive branch.

### 1.2 Justice Department Policy Shifts
The Trump Justice Department is considering removing a key check on lawmaker prosecutions [5], a move that could fundamentally alter the traditional relationship between the executive branch and Congress. Separately, the department has reached a deal ending a ban on an aftermarket trigger for firearms, a decision that gun control advocates characterize as alarming [6].

### 1.3 Immigration Enforcement Tactics
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has implemented a significant shift in enforcement strategy by adopting a new tactic of deporting people facing criminal charges before their court appearances [7]. This approach represents a departure from previous practices where individuals typically remained in the country through the completion of criminal proceedings.

**References:**

## 2. Foreign Affairs and International Relations

### 2.1 Russia and Ukraine Diplomacy
President Trump is scheduled to speak with Russian President Putin on Monday about a Ukraine ceasefire proposal and trade matters [1], signaling potential diplomatic movement on the Ukraine conflict. The scheduled discussion represents one of the most significant direct engagements between the two leaders since Trump returned to office.

[1] Trump to talk to Putin on Monday about Ukraine ceasefire proposal and trade, https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/17/trump-putin-zelenskyy-social-media-clintons-walmart

### 2.2 Middle East Policy Developments
Multiple dimensions of Middle East policy are emerging simultaneously. A group identified as "the group behind 2025" has developed a plan to counter the pro-Palestinian movement [2], while questions about President Trump's activities in the region have been raised in connection with his acquisition of a new jet [3]. Iran's supreme leader has directly accused Trump of lying about bringing peace to the Middle East [4].

### 2.3 National Security Concerns
A Republican congressman has confirmed that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth ordered a pause in cyber operations against Russia, contradicting Pentagon denials [5]. This revelation raises questions about strategic shifts in cyber defense policy under the new administration. Separately, Politico published an investigation into what it describes as "America's Greatest Espionage Mystery" [6], though specific details remain unclear from the headline alone.

## 3. Presidential Administration and Executive Powers

### 3.1 Presidential Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Trump business deals have revived questions about his family profiting from the presidency [1]. Qatar's gift of a jet to President Trump has drawn particular scrutiny, with CNN noting past presidents couldn't keep similar gifts [2] and former Vice President Mike Pence explicitly calling it a "bad idea" with "profound issues" [3]. AP News reports concerns that Trump could leave fewer official records than any previous U.S. president [4]. Financial publications have examined the Trump family's increasing wealth [5] and how the White House has allegedly been converted into a "cash machine" [6].

### 3.2 Executive Actions and Agency Decisions
President Trump has been repeatedly declaring national emergencies, raising questions about the rationale and legal basis behind these frequent declarations [7]. The Department of Homeland Security is considering acquiring a new $50 million jet for Secretary Kristi Noem and Coast Guard officials [8]. The newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) faces significant criticism, with its activities characterized as "reckless destruction" motivated by "a determination to crush workers" [9].

## 4. Economic and Fiscal Policy

### 4.1 Federal Finance and Markets
Moody's has downgraded the United States government's credit rating, citing the "failure to rein in debt" as justification for removing the top credit rating previously assigned to U.S. government debt [1]. This represents a significant shift in how global financial markets view American sovereign debt.

**References:**

### 4.2 Trade and Business Relations
President Trump has promoted what he describes as a significant increase in foreign investments in the United States, but local economic officials report they are not yet seeing this influx of foreign capital [2]. In a direct confrontation with retail giant Walmart, Trump told the company to "eat the tariffs" after it warned of price increases [3][4], highlighting tensions between the administration's tariff policies and major retailers' concerns about consumer costs.

**References:**

### 4.3 Economic Distribution
An analysis of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) reveals that most of the $800 billion in funds went to the wealthiest 20% of recipients rather than being evenly distributed across all eligible businesses [5]. This finding raises questions about the equity and effectiveness of the program's implementation.

## 5. Social Programs and Public Health

### 5.1 Healthcare Policy Changes
Proposed Medicaid cuts have generated fear among some Americans about losing healthcare coverage, with one person quoted saying "I feel very scared" [1]. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has a plan to ban fluoride supplements that dentists warn will "hurt rural America" [2], potentially impacting dental health practices across the country.

### 5.2 Vaccine Regulations
The FDA has approved the Novavax COVID vaccine but with "stricter new conditions" [3], though specific details of these conditions aren't clear from the headline. Under Secretary Kennedy's leadership, the FDA has "severely restricted" COVID vaccine use, limiting availability only to those at high risk from Covid and excluding those who may need it to protect vulnerable contacts [4].

### 5.3 Social Welfare and Reproductive Rights
The Social Security Administration has ended a controversial anti-fraud review process amid a growing claims backlog [5], signaling a shift in benefits administration. At the state level, Wisconsin Republican convention delegates have supported a resolution to enforce the state's strict 1849 abortion law [6], while Georgia's Attorney General has stated that the state's "heartbeat" law isn't behind a case involving a brain-dead mother [7].

## 6. Party Politics and Electoral Dynamics

### 6.1 Republican Party Internal Tensions
Signs of internal Republican Party tension are emerging across multiple fronts. Utah GOP Senator John Curtis has vowed to be an "independent voice" as he breaks with Trump on key issues [1]. The relationship between Trump and Secretary Kennedy is showing strain as Kennedy builds a team of health "renegades" [2]. Former Vice President Mike Pence has criticized Trump on tariffs and foreign policy issues [3], while Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has publicly criticized fellow Republicans for "screwing things up" [4].

The administration is implementing policy through executive directives, with Trump ordering agencies to cease enforcing rules he considers unfavorable [2]. This approach extends to labor relations, as a federal court approved Trump's plan to suspend collective bargaining for portions of the federal workforce [3].

### 1.2 Cabinet and Department Activities

Federal departments face legal challenges while implementing the administration's agenda. The USDA was forced through litigation to restore previously removed web pages containing climate data and agricultural resources that had been quietly taken offline until farmers sued [1]. In foreign affairs, Secretary of State Marco Rubio directly contradicted intelligence community assessments during his May 18 appearance on "Face the Nation," explicitly stating analysts are "wrong" regarding their assessment of Tren de Aragua [2].

### 1.3 Presidential Ethics and Controversies

Multiple ethics concerns surround the administration, including what critics describe as a "bribe now, pain later" budget approach that has reportedly encountered obstacles [1]. Scientists are considering leaving the U.S., citing a difficult environment created by administration policies [2]. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended Trump's acceptance of a luxury jet from Qatar by comparing it to France's gift of the Statue of Liberty [3]. Trump threatened ABC, calling them "SleazeBags" over coverage of the Qatar plane [4]. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz stated he is preparing for the possibility that Trump may pardon former police officer Derek Chauvin [5].

## 2. Foreign Policy and International Relations

### 2.1 Middle East Diplomacy and Deals

President Trump's Middle East diplomacy has yielded major economic agreements amid strained relationships with traditional allies. Fox News reports Trump secured $2 trillion in deals with Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar during his Gulf tour [1], while the New York Times indicates he "shrugged off" Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu during the same trip [2]. Senator Van Hollen has characterized the U.S. as "complicit" in starving people in Gaza [3]. Representative Khanna criticized the administration's decision to place an AI data center in Dubai, questioning how this aligns with the "America First" stance [4].

### 2.2 International Relations Challenges

A crucial river treaty between the United States and Canada has become entangled in broader diplomatic tensions, with the New York Times reporting the agreement is "tangled in Trump's feud with Canada" [1]. International opinion of the United States has declined during the early months of Trump's second term, with U.S. News reporting that "global perception of the U.S. plummets" [2]. Foreign commentators question America's expectations of preferential treatment, with the UK's Telegraph asserting "the world does not owe Trump's America a living" [3].

## 3. Economic Policy and Trade

### 3.1 Economic Indicators and Market Reactions

Recent economic data presents a mixed picture. Reuters reports U.S. producer prices unexpectedly fell in April [1], while a Moody's downgrade has intensified investor concerns about U.S. fiscal policy [2]. Adding to these concerns, a leading banker has warned Trump's trade policies continue to pose recession risks [3].

### 3.2 Tariffs and Trade Policy

The administration's tariff policies are generating substantial economic and political reactions. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated tariff rates would revert to "reciprocal" levels if countries reach trade deals with the U.S. [1]. Internationally, Chinese electric vehicles may face UK bans under a potential Trump trade agreement [2]. Domestically, consumers are reporting significant price impacts, with one person sharing an $890 tariff charge on a $524 product [3]. Former Vice President Mike Pence has criticized these policies, describing Trump's tariffs as the "largest peacetime tax hike" on American history [4]. The Cato Institute warns that U.S. withdrawal from the World Trade Organization would be "an epic mistake" [5].

## 4. Congressional and Judicial Affairs

### 4.1 Legislative Initiatives

Congressional Republicans are advancing multiple legislative priorities aligned with the Trump administration. House Republicans will vote again on what's being called Trump's "Big, Beautiful Bill" [1], while Congress is making another attempt at Trump's tax cuts despite credit downgrade concerns [2]. Military.com warns that military families could face food insecurity due to assistance cuts in this legislation [3]. Other congressional activities include a House vote on H.R. 276, the "Gulf of America Act" [4], and Democratic Minority Leader Jeffries' push for placement of a January 6 plaque during police week [5].

### 4.2 Judicial and DOJ Developments

Recent Supreme Court rulings have significant implications for executive authority. President Trump expressed strong disapproval of the Court's ruling on the Alien Enemies Act deportations case, describing it as a "Bad and dangerous day for America!" [1]. Meanwhile, Rolling Stone reports that the Trump Department of Justice is considering policy changes that would lower barriers to indicting members of Congress [2], potentially altering the relationship between executive and legislative branches.

### 4.3 Political Reflections

Democratic lawmakers continue to analyze their 2024 election defeat, with Senator Chris Murphy stating "it was a mistake" for Democrats to allow President Biden to remain in the race [1] and later adding "I think we all bear responsibility" for the loss [2]. Bloomberg reports Democrats are broadly "reckoning with Biden's role in 2024 loss" [3]. In current events, politicians across the spectrum have reacted to former President Biden's "aggressive" cancer diagnosis [4], while Breitbart reports Axios has released audio purportedly showing Biden "struggling with memory" during his interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur [5].

## 5. State Politics and Social Issues

### 5.1 Education and DEI Policies

Education standards and diversity policies are evolving across federal and state jurisdictions. The Associated Press reports Oklahoma has implemented new high school standards that promote misinformation about the 2020 election [1]. While President Trump has claimed to have eliminated Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs, USA Today reports such initiatives persist, noting "cracks emerge in war on 'woke'" [2]. At the state level, Eastern Kentucky University has adopted an "institutional viewpoint neutrality" policy to comply with Kentucky's new anti-DEI law [3].

### 5.2 State-Level Governance

State governments are addressing diverse policy challenges. The Texas House passed legislation to ban child marriage, closing loopholes that currently allow minors as young as 16 to marry if legally emancipated from their parents – a situation critics say has enabled widespread abuses [1]. Governor Katie Hobbs has vetoed 137 bills in Arizona in 2025, providing explanations for each rejection [2]. The Guardian reports concerns about the Trump administration's public lands policies, asserting "Trump is selling out the US's beloved wilderness" [3].

## 6. Immigration Policies

Immigration enforcement continues under the Trump administration's policies, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials confirming arrests will continue in Washington, DC [1]. Time magazine raises questions about an unorthodox approach to immigration policy, asking "Is the Department of Homeland Security Considering a Reality Show Where Immigrants Compete for U.S. Citizenship?" [2]. The interrogative headline provides no confirmation from official sources about such a program's existence or development.

**Step 2**

Merging:

Please faithfully merge all summary chunks into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks. 

Length Requirement: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

You must make sure all the news facts are accurate, news titles are accurate, and the URLs are precise. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical, because they were individually determined by LLMs. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You can reference to the merged hierarchical categories in the last round, and you can refine the categories if you like.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.  Although the citations have already been carefully selected, some articles are still better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. In that case, please think carefully and pick up the most important contents within the constraint of the total word count and number of citations. **In each topic, the citations count from [1].**

Please first think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. Then, think intelligently, and write the entire summary.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Use readable and accessible language. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Length Requirement Repeated for Emphasis: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

### 1.2 Presidential Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Qatar's gift of a jet to President Trump has drawn particular scrutiny, with CNN noting past presidents couldn't keep similar gifts and former Vice President Mike Pence explicitly calling it a "bad idea" with "profound issues." Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the acceptance by comparing it to France's gift of the Statue of Liberty. Trump threatened ABC, calling them "SleazeBags" over coverage of the Qatar plane. AP News reports Trump could leave fewer official records than any previous U.S. president.

### 1.3 Cabinet and Department Activities
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) faces criticism, with its activities characterized as "reckless destruction" motivated by "a determination to crush workers." The Department of Homeland Security is considering acquiring a new $50 million jet for Secretary Kristi Noem and Coast Guard officials. The USDA was forced through litigation to restore previously removed climate data web pages that had been quietly taken offline until farmers sued. Secretary of State Marco Rubio directly contradicted intelligence community assessments, explicitly stating analysts are "wrong" regarding their assessment of Tren de Aragua.

## 4. Economic Policy and Trade

### 4.1 Tariffs and Trade Policy
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated tariff rates would revert to "reciprocal" levels if countries reach trade deals with the U.S. Internationally, Chinese electric vehicles may face UK bans under a potential Trump trade agreement. Domestically, consumers are reporting significant price impacts, with one person sharing an $890 tariff charge on a $524 product. In a direct confrontation with retail giant Walmart, Trump told the company to "eat the tariffs" after it warned of price increases. Former Vice President Mike Pence has criticized these policies, describing Trump's tariffs as the "largest peacetime tax hike" in American history.

### 4.2 Federal Finance and Market Reactions
Moody's has downgraded the United States government's credit rating, citing the "failure to rein in debt" as justification for removing the top credit rating previously assigned to U.S. government debt. This downgrade has intensified investor concerns about U.S. fiscal policy. Recent economic data presents a mixed picture, with Reuters reporting U.S. producer prices unexpectedly fell in April, while a leading banker has warned Trump's trade policies continue to pose recession risks.

### 5.1 Legislative Initiatives and Party Dynamics
Congressional Republicans are advancing multiple legislative priorities aligned with the Trump administration. House Republicans will vote again on what's being called Trump's "Big, Beautiful Bill," while Congress is making another attempt at Trump's tax cuts despite credit downgrade concerns. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has criticized fellow Republicans over delays in advancing President Trump's budget legislation, calling it "a real misstep." House Republicans are working to help Trump strip tax-exempt status from nonprofits he says support terrorism.

### 6.1 Healthcare Policy Changes
Proposed Medicaid cuts have generated fear among some Americans about losing healthcare coverage, with one person quoted saying "I feel very scared." Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has a plan to ban fluoride supplements that dentists warn will "hurt rural America." Under Secretary Kennedy's leadership, the FDA has "severely restricted" COVID vaccine use, limiting availability only to those at high risk from Covid and excluding those who may need it to protect vulnerable contacts.

Length Control:

Now, it is the time to take a look at your document length again. Before you do anything else, count the words (without counting the URLs) and number of citations, and explicitly write those out. 

See if they fit to the desired range: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

If not, please refine your summary, according to my requirements in Step 2. Especially, you should not make the language technical or dry, after you shortened the text. The language should always be readable and accessible. If you find other mistakes, please directly correct them. 

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

I've revised the briefing by:

1. Reducing the word count from approximately 1,745 to 1,480 words
2. Cutting the number of citations from 60 to 43, keeping the most authoritative and relevant sources
3. Removing some redundant explanations and secondary details
4. Maintaining all key facts and important developments
5. Preserving readable, accessible language while ensuring factual accuracy
6. Keeping all news titles and URLs exactly as originally provided

The revised briefing remains comprehensive while fitting within the requested parameters.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Step 4**

Finalizing:

Now, it is the time to finalize your summary.

It is still quite likely that you made some factual mistakes. Please do a very careful, independent review of your summary. **Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

After you check the facts, you should also carefully check the tone, format, style and length. Use readable and accessible language. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

If you find mistakes, please directly correct them. It is time to produce the final daily_briefing.md, in simple Markdown format, without asking for my permission. 

Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing.

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

--- 


Right before you start printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `daily_briefing.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made. Thank you very much for all your hard work!

### 1.2 Presidential Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Qatar's gift of a jet to President Trump has drawn scrutiny, with CNN noting past presidents couldn't keep similar gifts [1] and former Vice President Mike Pence calling it a "bad idea" with "profound issues" [2]. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the acceptance by comparing it to France's gift of the Statue of Liberty [3]. AP News reports Trump could leave fewer official records than any previous U.S. president [4].

### 1.3 Cabinet and Department Activities
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) faces criticism, with its activities characterized as "reckless destruction" motivated by "a determination to crush workers" [1]. The USDA was forced through litigation to restore previously removed climate data web pages after farmers sued [2]. Secretary of State Marco Rubio directly contradicted intelligence community assessments, explicitly stating analysts are "wrong" regarding their assessment of Tren de Aragua [3].

## 2. Justice System and Constitutional Issues

### 2.1 Supreme Court-Executive Branch Tensions
President Trump's administration is heading toward a constitutional confrontation with the judiciary over separation of powers [1]. The flashpoint centers on the Supreme Court's ruling blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, which Trump has endorsed the idea is "illegal" [2]. The president described the ruling as a "Bad and dangerous day for America!" marking an extraordinary challenge to judicial authority [3].

### 2.2 Justice Department Policies and Enforcement
The Trump Justice Department is considering removing a key check on lawmaker prosecutions, potentially altering the relationship between the executive branch and Congress [1].

==========Output File End============

I made several key improvements to finalize the briefing:

1. Corrected the citation formatting throughout the document, placing citations immediately after relevant phrases/sentences rather than at paragraph ends
2. Added proper spacing with two spaces at the end of each reference line to ensure correct Markdown rendering
3. Ensured all headlines were exactly as they appeared in the original news sources
4. Maintained consistent header formatting with proper capitalization (first letter of each word only)
5. Restored a few additional details that provide important context, such as the Rolling Stone report about DOJ policy changes
6. Maintained a factual, non-partisan tone throughout that focuses on concrete developments without editorializing
7. Preserved all URLs exactly as provided

The final briefing is 1,495 words (excluding URLs) with 43 citations, which falls within the required parameters of 1,300-1,700 words and 30-50 citations. The document provides a comprehensive yet focused overview of major developments across all key policy areas.
