A federal court approved Trump's plan to suspend collective bargaining for portions of the federal workforce [3].

### 1.2 Presidential Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Qatar's gift of a jet to President Trump has drawn scrutiny, with CNN noting past presidents couldn't keep similar gifts [1] and former Vice President Mike Pence calling it a "bad idea" with "profound issues" [2].

### 1.3 Cabinet and Department Activities
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) faces criticism, with its activities characterized as "reckless destruction" motivated by "a determination to crush workers" [1]. The USDA was forced through litigation to restore previously removed climate data web pages after farmers sued [2]. Secretary of State Marco Rubio directly contradicted intelligence community assessments, explicitly stating analysts are "wrong" regarding their assessment of Tren de Aragua [3].

## 2. Justice System and Constitutional Issues

### 2.1 Supreme Court-Executive Branch Tensions
President Trump's administration is heading toward a constitutional confrontation with the judiciary over separation of powers [1]. The flashpoint centers on the Supreme Court's ruling blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, which Trump has endorsed the idea is "illegal" [2]. The president described the ruling as a "Bad and dangerous day for America!" marking an extraordinary challenge to judicial authority [3].

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has implemented a significant shift in enforcement strategy by adopting a new tactic of deporting people facing criminal charges before their court appearances [1]. This approach represents a departure from previous practices where individuals typically remained in the country through completion of criminal proceedings. ICE officials have confirmed that arrests will continue in Washington, DC [2].
