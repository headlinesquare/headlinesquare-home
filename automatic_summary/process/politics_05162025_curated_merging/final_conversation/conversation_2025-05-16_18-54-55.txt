**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

---

Because there are several hundreds of news articles posted in some subreddit communities every day, it is hard to summarize all of them in a single process. Fortunately, I have already broken the articles in that day into chunks by submission time in the 24 hour coverage window in ascending order, and generated summaries for each chunk with LLMs. Those detailed summary chunks will be posted here. Each has a length of 1300-1700 words without counting the URLs, and citing 30-50 news articles. 

The chunks are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, there are 4 chunks, and the news coverage cycle is from yesterday's 18:00 to today's 18:00. Chunk 1 is from the articles submitted between 18:00 of yesterday to 06:00 of today, Chunk 2 is for 06:00 to 10:00 today, Chunk 3 is for 10:00 to 14:00 today, and Chunk 4 is from 14:00 to 18:00 today. The first chunk is based on the earliest articles submitted to the subreddit community. The last chunk is based on the latest articles submitted. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in Chunk 2 **happen** after all the news stories in Chunk 1, just because they are **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from Chunk 1 and B from Chunk 2, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This rule applies to all chunks in sequential order. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from different chunks. 

**Your task is to critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks, and then faithfully merge all of them into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks.** 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

---

Please tell me if you are ready to receive the individual summaries. I will provide them all at once. And please follow my later instructions, be patient, do the work step by step.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the individual summary chunks. I understand I'll need to analyze them critically and merge them into a single comprehensive daily briefing that maintains factual accuracy while considering various political perspectives. I'll be relying entirely on the information contained in these summaries and the political context you've provided for May 2025, rather than my internal knowledge.

Please provide the summaries, and I'll process them carefully to create an objective analysis that both Democratic and Republican leadership can use to understand the current situation.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1**

Comparing:

Please critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks provided below. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You must use your limited length to summarize the most important news, while skipping the secondary.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.

Please carefully think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. **You will do the merging task in the next round with my detailed instructions. Please do not attempt to write down your summary at this step, because you haven't been given the full instructions yet!** It is always better to take some time to think clearly for such a difficult task, and make detailed plans for yourself, before taking any actions. You should use this opportunity to prepare yourself for your next round of work by writing down some notes for yourself.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Foreign Policy and International Relations

### 1.1 Middle East Diplomacy and Presidential Travel
President Trump's recent Middle East trip marks a significant shift from his previously characterized "MAGA isolationism" in foreign policy [1]. The visit signals an evolving approach to international relations under the second Trump administration. Some former officials have also noted that this trip may signal a strategic shift in the administration's diplomatic posture [2].

### 1.2 Global Business Partnerships
The Trump administration has secured substantial economic partnerships with the United Arab Emirates, highlighted by massive business deals worth over $200 billion [1]. A centerpiece includes a partnership with Abu Dhabi to construct a large-scale AI data center complex in the UAE [2], representing significant technological collaboration that could expand both countries' influence in artificial intelligence infrastructure and digital economy sectors.

### 1.3 Trade Negotiations and Agreements
A disagreement has emerged in U.S.-India trade negotiations, with Indian officials directly challenging President Trump's public claim that India would charge "no tariffs" under a new trade agreement [1]. This public contradiction highlights tensions in finalizing trade terms between the world's two largest democracies. Furthermore, additional reporting highlights India's signals for a tougher trade stance amid global pressures [2].

## 2. Justice, Law Enforcement, and Legal Developments

### 2.1 Supreme Court Cases and Federal Judiciary
The Supreme Court is reportedly struggling with a case related to birthright citizenship associated with President Trump [1]. The justices have been described as "baffled" by aspects of the case, indicating significant constitutional questions about citizenship rights that could have far-reaching implications for immigration law. Additional analysis of the Supreme Court arguments on the matter further underscores the legal uncertainties [2].

### 2.2 Federal Law Enforcement Activities and Reorganization
The FBI has eliminated its public corruption squad that previously supported Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into former President Trump [1]. This organizational restructuring represents a significant change in bureau operations, particularly affecting units that had been involved in high-profile political investigations. The timing of this reorganization—months into the Trump administration—raises questions about shifting federal law enforcement priorities.

### 2.3 Investigations of Political Figures
Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Secret Service for allegedly threatening President Trump in a since-deleted Instagram post containing the code "8647" [1]. The specific meaning of this numerical code has not been explained in the reports. Separate coverage characterizes the allegations more severely, suggesting Comey is "accused of calling for Trump assassination" [2]. Further reporting details that Comey later took down the controversial Instagram post amid significant public uproar [3].

## 3. Trump Administration and Executive Actions

### 3.1 Executive Branch Controversies and Criticisms
The Trump administration faces mounting criticism over allegations of nepotism and cronyism in its appointment and hiring practices [1]. Critics argue that certain appointments may prioritize personal connections over qualifications. Additional reports indicate bipartisan resistance to some executive actions, such as moves aimed at seizing control of legislative resources [2].

### 3.2 White House Communications and Presidential Image
President Trump's image has been prominently displayed on a USDA building, prompting critics to compare it to authoritarian leadership imagery seen in regimes such as North Korea and Russia [1]. The display, described as going "full on Dear Leader," has raised concerns about the personalization of government institutions, even though details regarding its authorization remain unclear.

## 4. Immigration and Border Security

### 4.1 Deportation and Enforcement Actions
The Department of Homeland Security has requested the deployment of 20,000 National Guard troops to assist with deportation operations [1]. This move represents a significant escalation in the use of military personnel for immigration enforcement, suggesting a potential major expansion of deportation efforts under Secretary Noem's leadership. Details regarding target populations or geographic focus remain unspecified.

References:  
[1] DHS asks for 20,000 National Guard troops to assist in deportations, https://www.npr.org/2025/05/15/nx-s1-5399656/national-guard-immigration  

### 4.2 Immigration Policy Proposals
Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has proposed an unconventional immigration policy that would have migrants compete for U.S. citizenship via a reality television show [1]. This departure from traditional citizenship pathways introduces many unanswered questions regarding its practical application, selection criteria, and legal framework.

References:

## 5. Economic and Fiscal Policy

### 5.1 Tariffs and Trade Impact
Attorney General Pam Bondi reportedly sold millions of dollars in Trump Media stock on the same day that President Trump imposed extensive tariffs [1]. The timing of this financial transaction raises potential concerns about conflicts of interest, though specifics regarding the tariffs or their targets remain unclear. Additional reporting indicates that consumers are now hit by unexpected tariff bills [2], complicating the economic landscape.

### 5.2 International Economic Agreements
The administration's focus on international business deals is underscored by the more than $200 billion in agreements struck with the UAE [1]. These economic partnerships constitute a substantial element of the Trump administration's approach to integrating international economic strategy with domestic policy debates.

References:  
[1] Trump announces more than $200bn of deals between US and UAE, https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/15/trump-200bn-uae  

## 6. Health and Social Policy

### 6.1 Medicaid and Healthcare Access
Representatives Kathy Castor and Darren Soto are calling for a federal investigation into what they describe as the "unlawful diversion" of Medicaid funds to an entity called Hope Florida [1]. This move reflects congressional concerns over potential misuse of critical federal healthcare resources, though details regarding the amount or nature of the diversion are limited.

References:  
[1] Reps. Castor, Soto Urge Federal Investigation into Unlawful Diversion of Medicaid Funds to Hope Florida, https://castor.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=404915  

### 6.2 Federal Health Recommendations and Initiatives
Federal health officials are reportedly considering scaling back their recommendations regarding COVID-19 vaccines [1]. While the specifics of the proposed changes are not disclosed, this potential shift signals a possible adjustment to longstanding public health protocols. Furthermore, HHS is reported to be reconsidering routine COVID vaccinations for children and pregnant women [2].

### 6.3 Education and School Policies
In response to an executive order from President Trump, several states are reexamining their school discipline policies [1]. This development suggests that federal influence may be prompting states to revisit established disciplinary frameworks, although the precise changes and targeted states remain unspecified.

References:  
[1] Some states reexamine school discipline as Trump order paves go-ahead, https://stateline.org/2025/05/15/some-states-reexamine-school-discipline-as-trump-order-paves-go-ahead/  

### 6.4 State-Level Health and Social Policies
Florida has enacted legislation banning the addition of fluoride to public water systems, making it the second state in the nation to implement such a prohibition [1]. This move represents a significant departure from long-standing water fluoridation practices and could have important implications for public dental health, though context regarding the rationale is limited.

References:  
[1] Florida becomes second state to ban fluoride in public water, https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/florida-becomes-second-state-ban-fluoride-public-water-rcna205127  

## 7. Political Landscape and Party Dynamics

### 7.1 Democratic Party Developments and Strategy
Internal Democratic Party tensions are evident from recent statements by party figures. An unnamed House Democrat stated it was "obvious now" that President Biden "was not in a condition" to run for reelection [1], reflecting retrospective criticism of the party's candidate selection process. In contrast, veteran strategist James Carville expressed optimism about electoral prospects despite dismal polling figures [2].

### 7.2 Republican Party Dynamics and Strategy
Division within the Republican ranks is emerging over proposed cuts to climate-related legislation—a discord that could undermine the passage of a major GOP legislative package [1]. Several Republican lawmakers have expressed anger over these proposed reductions, highlighting internal disagreements regarding environmental policy priorities.

### 7.3 Political Funding and Controversy
Voters who were allegedly promised $100 payments by a Political Action Committee associated with Elon Musk claim they have not received the funds [1]. The report does not detail what was expected of the voters in return or provide specifics on the scale or timing of the payments, leaving important questions about campaign finance practices unanswered.

[1] Voters promised $100 by Musk PAC say they weren't paid, https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5302053-elon-musk-america-first-pac-second-lawsuit-petition/  

### 7.4 Political Expressions and Public Statements
A death row inmate reportedly used his final statement before execution to express support for President Trump by saying, "President Trump, keep making America great" [1]. This unusual expression of political sentiment highlights how political messages can emerge in unexpected contexts, though further information about the individual or circumstances is not provided.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Leadership and Administration

### 1.1 Cabinet and Agency Management

President Trump has removed the FEMA director, creating notable tension within Republican ranks. GOP senators have expressed unease about this dismissal of the head of the disaster response agency [1]. The headline does not specify the reasoning behind the firing or which senators have voiced concerns.

[1] Trump's firing of FEMA director unsettles GOP senators, https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5302942-senate-republicans-criticize-fema-firing/  

### 1.2 Presidential Actions and Statements

The administration faces a legislative hurdle as the President now requires congressional cooperation for what he terms his "big, beautiful bill" [1]. This legislation appears to be struggling to gain traction according to reporting from the Christian Science Monitor. The shift suggests a move from executive action to legislative collaboration.

[1] Trump suddenly needs Congress – and his 'big, beautiful bill' is on the rocks, https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2025/0516/trump-congress-spending-tax-bill  

## 2. Domestic Social Issues

### 2.1 Civil Rights and Education

Some Republican lawmakers are advocating to "put school desegregation officially in the past," according to The New York Times [1]. The headline does not identify which specific Republicans are driving this initiative or what legislative or regulatory mechanisms might be employed.

Utah's education system continues to restrict academic materials, with officials banning an 18th book from all public schools in the state [2]. The headline indicates this is part of a larger book prohibition trend, with 17 previous texts already banned. The specific content of the newly prohibited book is not detailed in the headline, though the article apparently provides those details.

## 3. International Relations

### 3.1 Foreign Policy and Diplomatic Tensions

A former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine has reportedly resigned in direct response to the Trump administration's foreign policy approach [1]. The headline, written in first person ("I was U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. I resigned because of Trump's foreign policy."), does not identify which specific ambassador resigned or detail which aspects of current foreign policy prompted their departure.

## 4. Immigration and Border Policy

This allegation suggests the use of diplomatic channels to advance private business interests connected to a high-profile administration figure.

# Critical Analysis of Summary Chunks

After examining the three summary chunks, I observe several overlapping areas that need to be consolidated intelligently:

## Key Thematic Areas Across Summaries:

   - Ambassador resignations and diplomatic tensions

3. **Justice System and Legal Matters**
   - Supreme Court cases (birthright citizenship)
   - DOJ actions (Boeing investigation, FBI reorganization)
   - Investigations of political figures (Comey "8647" controversy)
   - Legal challenges to presidential authority

4. **Immigration and Border Security**

   - Reality TV citizenship competition (appears in all three chunks)
   - ICE enforcement actions

## Significant Overlapping Stories:

Several stories appear across multiple chunks with varying details:
- Immigration reality show proposal (all three chunks)
- James Comey "8647" investigation (chunks 1, 2, 3)
- Trump's Middle East trip outcomes (chunks 1, 2, 3)
- Tax legislation setback (chunks 2, 3)
- Trump's tariff policies (chunks 1, 3)
- Medicaid policy debates (chunks 1, 2, 3)

## Proposed Hierarchy for Merged Summary:

I'll organize the merged summary using these main categories with appropriate subcategories, prioritizing the most significant developments while maintaining approximate length parity with individual chunks. I'll merge related topics that appear across multiple chunks to provide comprehensive coverage without redundancy.


====================
    Round 3
    User: 
====================

**Step 2**

Merging:

Please faithfully merge all summary chunks into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks. 

Length Requirement: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

You must make sure all the news facts are accurate, news titles are accurate, and the URLs are precise. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical, because they were individually determined by LLMs. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You can reference to the merged hierarchical categories in the last round, and you can refine the categories if you like.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.  Although the citations have already been carefully selected, some articles are still better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. In that case, please think carefully and pick up the most important contents within the constraint of the total word count and number of citations. **In each topic, the citations count from [1].**

Please first think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. Then, think intelligently, and write the entire summary.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Use readable and accessible language. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Length Requirement Repeated for Emphasis: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

Please directly produce daily_briefing.txt containing your new summary, without asking for my permission.

### 1.4 Administration Initiatives and Controversies
An internal document has reportedly exposed the Trump-Musk initiative to identify Social Security fraud as "a huge scandal" and "a sham." This revelation concerns the joint initiative between President Trump and Elon Musk, head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Russell Vought is characterized as "The Visionary of Trump 2.0" who is "advancing a radical ideological project decades in the making," according to The Atlantic. The administration also faces mounting criticism over allegations of nepotism and cronyism in its appointment practices.

### 2.1 Middle East Diplomacy and Economic Partnerships
The Trump administration has secured substantial economic partnerships with the United Arab Emirates, highlighted by massive business deals worth over $200 billion. A centerpiece includes a partnership with Abu Dhabi to construct a large-scale AI data center complex in the UAE.

### 2.2 Trade Negotiations and Global Agreements
President Trump has announced plans to unilaterally set new tariff rates for countries, bypassing traditional negotiation processes. The President justified this approach stating: "It's not possible to meet the number of people that want to see us."

A disagreement has emerged in U.S.-India trade negotiations, with Indian officials directly challenging President Trump's public claim that India would charge "no tariffs" under a new trade agreement. This public contradiction highlights tensions in finalizing trade terms between the two nations.

Length Control:

Now, it is the time to take a look at your document length again. Before you do anything else, count the words (without counting the URLs) and number of citations, and explicitly write those out. 

See if they fit to the desired range: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

If not, please refine your summary, according to my requirements in Step 2. Especially, you should not make the language technical or dry, after you shortened the text. The language should always be readable and accessible. If you find other mistakes, please directly correct them. 

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Word count (excluding URLs): 1,447 words
Citation count: 39 citations

I've revised the daily briefing to meet the word count requirements. The main changes include:

1. Consolidating related information within sections to eliminate redundancy
2. Removing some less critical details while preserving essential facts
3. Merging certain references where topics were closely related
4. Streamlining language while maintaining clarity and readability
5. Preserving all original headlines and URLs exactly as provided
6. Double-checking all facts to ensure accuracy and prevent hallucinations

The final document is now within the target range of 1300-1700 words with 39 citations, which falls within the requested 30-50 citation range.

**Step 4**

Finalizing:

Now, it is the time to finalize your summary.

It is still quite likely that you made some factual mistakes. Please do a very careful, independent review of your summary. **Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

After you check the facts, you should also carefully check the tone, format, style and length. Use readable and accessible language. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

If you find mistakes, please directly correct them. It is time to produce the final daily_briefing.md, in simple Markdown format, without asking for my permission. 

Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing.

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

--- 


Right before you start printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `daily_briefing.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made. Thank you very much for all your hard work!
