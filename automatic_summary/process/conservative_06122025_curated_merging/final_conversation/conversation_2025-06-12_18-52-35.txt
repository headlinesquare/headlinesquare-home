**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch expanded their power dramatically, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025], and the tech czar Elon Musk [The founder and former head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)]. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. Now, Elon Musk is leaving his role as the head of DOGE, but his influence continues.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

---

Because there are several hundreds of news articles posted in some subreddit communities every day, it is hard to summarize all of them in a single process. Fortunately, I have already broken the articles in that day into chunks by submission time in the 24 hour coverage window in ascending order, and generated summaries for each chunk with LLMs. Those detailed summary chunks will be posted here. Each has a length of 1300-1700 words without counting the URLs, and citing 30-50 news articles. 

The chunks are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, there are 4 chunks, and the news coverage cycle is from yesterday's 18:00 to today's 18:00. Chunk 1 is from the articles submitted between 18:00 of yesterday to 06:00 of today, Chunk 2 is for 06:00 to 10:00 today, Chunk 3 is for 10:00 to 14:00 today, and Chunk 4 is from 14:00 to 18:00 today. The first chunk is based on the earliest articles submitted to the subreddit community. The last chunk is based on the latest articles submitted. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in Chunk 2 **happen** after all the news stories in Chunk 1, just because they are **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from Chunk 1 and B from Chunk 2, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This rule applies to all chunks in sequential order. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from different chunks. 

**Your task is to critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks, and then faithfully merge all of them into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks.** 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

---

Please tell me if you are ready to receive the individual summaries. I will provide them all at once. And please follow my later instructions, be patient, do the work step by step.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I am ready to receive the individual summaries. Please provide them all at once, and I will carefully analyze and synthesize them into a comprehensive daily briefing that accurately represents the current political landscape as of May 2025, following all of your guidelines regarding factual accuracy and appropriate attribution of positions.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1**

Comparing:

Please critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks provided below. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You must use your limited length to summarize the most important news, while skipping the secondary.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.

Please carefully think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. **You will do the merging task in the next round with my detailed instructions. Please do not attempt to write down your summary at this step, because you haven't been given the full instructions yet!** It is always better to take some time to think clearly for such a difficult task, and make detailed plans for yourself, before taking any actions. You should use this opportunity to prepare yourself for your next round of work by writing down some notes for yourself.

### 1.2 Democratic Party Internal Affairs
The Democratic National Committee faces internal turmoil as David Hogg has been removed from his position as DNC vice chair. Reports indicate his removal was connected to DNC diversity rules [1, 2], with The Daily Wire characterizing it as "DEI Claims Another Scalp" [2]. The Blaze adds that Hogg's departure came "weeks after spilling beans to an undercover reporter" [3], suggesting additional controversies beyond the diversity re-vote.

### 1.3 Political Figures and Statements
The Free Press has published an analysis claiming Gavin Newsom "will never be president" [1], while Secretary of State Rubio has reportedly implemented workforce cuts at USAID despite a Clinton-appointed judge blocking such reductions [2]. New York City Mayor Eric Adams told Newsmax "We Won't Allow You to Destroy Our City" [3], though the headline doesn't specify what threat he was addressing. Meanwhile, The Telegraph reports on an unnamed "Democrat mayor in denial about the violence ripping her city apart" [4].

## 2. Civil Unrest and Law Enforcement

### 2.1 Federal Intervention in Los Angeles
President Trump has federalized the National Guard in response to riots in Los Angeles, with Fox News reporting this action sends "a clear message" that the current administration's approach differs from that of 2020 [1]. This represents a significant federal intervention, though specific operational details are not provided in the headline.

──────────────────────────────

### 2.2 Los Angeles Riots Response
California authorities have shifted their approach to addressing looting during the ongoing Los Angeles riots. Fox News reports looters now face "hard-charging consequences" following what the outlet characterizes as the state abandoning a "soft-on-crime approach" [1]. This suggests a significant policy shift in how California is responding to property crimes during civil unrest.

──────────────────────────────

### 2.3 Political Reactions to Civil Unrest
Multiple commentators have weighed in on the Los Angeles riots with divergent characterizations. City Journal argues the protests are "not organic" but rather "organized" [1], while Hot Air explicitly states "This Really Does Qualify as an Insurrection" [2]. Professor Alan Dershowitz has supported Trump's decision to "prevent the spread of coordinated riots" [3], while RedState criticizes what it terms the "Unending Sophistry of Leftists Gaslighting About the 'Mostly Peaceful' Riots" [4].

Additional reports indicate tensions between federal and state responses [5], while Breitbart reports that Omar's daughter has expressed support for "Anti-ICE Riots" and urged "Death" to the "Colonial Empire," specifically naming the U.S. and Israel as "One Oppressor" [6]. A separate report mentions a U.S. Army soldier allegedly "defecting to ProRiot Leftists" [7].

## 3. Legal and Judicial Developments

### 3.1 Court Rulings on Protesters
A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to deport Mahmoud Khalil, who is connected to protests at Columbia University. Fox News reports the judge "sided with Mahmoud Khalil" and "halts Trump administration's deportation bid" [1]. Townhall provides additional context, identifying Khalil as a "Pro-Hamas Activist" and noting the ruling prevents both deportation and detention [2]. Newsmax adds that Khalil was specifically a "Columbia University Protester" who "Must Be Released" according to the judge's ruling [3].

Hot Air reports the FBI has arrested an individual characterized as a "Riot Supplier" and filed conspiracy charges [1], suggesting law enforcement has identified at least one person allegedly providing material support to ongoing civil unrest. In a separate investigation, the Washington Examiner discusses why "Biden's doctor could be untouchable in autopen investigation" [2].

### 3.3 Legal Penalties and Rights
Republican lawmakers are reportedly working to protect the free speech rights of anti-abortion advocates, according to Life News [1]. Separately, Maxine Waters' campaign has been ordered to pay a financial penalty for violating multiple election rules, with Fox News reporting the "Activist Democrat" must pay "$68 thousands" for these violations [2].

## 4. International Relations and Security

### 4.1 Middle East Conflict
Two significant developments have emerged in the ongoing Middle East conflict. Breitbart reports Hamas has attacked a bus carrying workers from an American aid group in Gaza, resulting in five deaths and the possibility of hostages being taken [1]. This represents a direct attack on U.S.-affiliated humanitarian operations in the region. Simultaneously, regional tensions appear to be escalating beyond Gaza, with Townhall reporting on speculation about whether "Israel Will Attack Iran" amid increasing tensions throughout the Middle East [2].

### 4.2 Military and Defense Agreements
Denmark has approved the establishment of U.S. military bases on Danish soil, according to a report that also mentions President Trump's interest in Greenland [1]. This represents a significant expansion of U.S. military presence in the Nordic region, though the headline provides no details about the number, type, or specific locations of the approved bases.

## 5. Immigration and Border Security

### 5.1 ICE Operations and Enforcement
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has conducted several significant operations. DHS reports ICE has arrested an "Illegal Alien" in connection with a "Molotov Cocktail Attack on Law Enforcement" that was documented on video [1]. In a separate incident, Fox News reports ICE officers were "assaulted by illegal immigrant during Nebraska meat plant raid" according to DHS [2].

These enforcement actions appear to be part of a broader strategy, as The Telegraph quotes an unnamed "Trump's border tsar" stating "We'll flood liberal cities with ICE raids" [3]. In a related development, a "Woke Activist" who was allegedly "Doxxing ICE Agents" has reportedly been "Busted" and is "Begging for Forgiveness" [4].

### 5.2 Deportation Policies
The Trump administration has secured an agreement with an unnamed European nation to temporarily host immigrants deported from the United States, according to Fox News [1]. This represents a significant development in international cooperation on migration management, though the headline does not specify which European country has agreed to this arrangement.

### 5.3 Border Incidents
A Canadian father and son have pleaded guilty to illegally crossing the U.S. border at Derby Line, according to the Newport Dispatch [1]. The headline provides minimal detail beyond the basic fact of the illegal entry and subsequent legal admission of guilt.

## 6. Economic and Environmental Policy

### 6.1 Energy Regulations
President Trump is taking action to reduce California's electric vehicle mandates, with the Daily Wire reporting he plans to "Slash California's Far-Reaching EV Mandates: 'Never Achievable'" [1]. This suggests a significant federal intervention in state-level environmental regulations. Concurrently, as civil unrest continues in Los Angeles, American Greatness claims that "California's Elite Twists the Truth on Energy" [2].

## 7. Media and Society

### 7.1 Media Coverage of Civil Unrest
Conservative commentators have criticized mainstream media coverage of the Los Angeles riots, with Fox News host Greg Gutfeld reportedly identifying a "Disturbing Trend In Their LA Riots Coverage" [1]. Breitbart reports that some media outlets have defended "Mexican Flag Being Flown at L.A. Riots" by characterizing it as "'Tradition'" and "'Diversity'" [2]. The Babylon Bee, a satirical publication, reports "CNN Reports Peaceful Night In L.A. As Majority Of Cars Not On Fire" [3].

### 7.2 National Identity Debates
Just The News reports that participants in the Los Angeles riots and their supporters are "invoking Mexico's past ownership of much of the western United States to claim a heritage and tie to the land that predates American ownership" [1]. The headline further poses the question "Is California becoming America's 'Palestine'?", drawing a parallel between territorial disputes and historical land ownership changes.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Immigration and Border Enforcement

### 1.1 ICE Operations Intensify Amid Political Backlash

Federal immigration authorities have launched aggressive operations targeting what they describe as the "worst of the worst illegal alien criminals" during Los Angeles riots [1]. The administration's hardline approach has provoked fierce resistance from Democratic officials nationwide. Chicago's mayor characterized ICE raids as "terrorism," comparing the current administration to a scenario where "the Confederacy won" [2]. A California Democrat similarly labeled these operations "domestic terrorism" [3], while another Democratic representative escalated the rhetoric further, comparing ICE agents to the Gestapo and declaring "I'm fighting today's Nazis!" [4].

The Department of Justice has directly challenged state-level sanctuary protections by filing suit against New York over a law preventing ICE from conducting arrests at courthouses [5]. In a related confrontation, Representative Elise Stefanik reportedly left Governor Kathy Hochul "stammering" during an exchange over New York's sanctuary policies [6].

Adding to the contentious atmosphere, the Department of Homeland Security posted what was described as a "foreign invaders deportation meme," prompting strong criticism from liberal commentators [7]. The polarization surrounding immigration policy was further demonstrated during a CNN panel discussion where Batya Ungar-Sargon's comments on illegal immigration reportedly triggered heated reactions [8].

## 2. Civil Unrest and Law Enforcement

### 2.1 FBI Targets Riot Organizers and Suppliers

Federal authorities have moved swiftly against individuals allegedly facilitating civil unrest in Los Angeles. The FBI has arrested a "riot supplier" on conspiracy charges [1] and detained an alleged riot leader who was documented distributing "Bionic Shield" face masks to protesters [2]. These enforcement actions indicate a strategy focused not only on participants but on those allegedly providing logistical support to rioters.

A controversial analysis published by one source claims "Democratic operatives are using orchestrated street violence to fracture the military leadership and destabilize the Trump presidency—again" [3]. The headline suggests this represents a recurring pattern, though this assertion comes from a single source without additional corroboration.

Reports indicate Florida has implemented stricter regulations regarding protesters surrounding vehicles compared to California [4]. There are also mentions of "No Kings" protests appearing across various state and city subreddits [5], though the headlines provide no details regarding the nature, scope, or objectives of these demonstrations.

## 3. Congressional Activities and Confrontations

### 3.1 DOGE Budget Cuts Advance Amid Heated Exchanges

The House has passed significant budget cuts proposed by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), specifically targeting foreign aid, NPR, and PBS [1]. This marks a major legislative victory for the administration's cost-cutting agenda.

Multiple confrontations between Democratic lawmakers and Trump administration officials have erupted recently. A Democratic senator was forcibly removed after reportedly "crashing" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem's press conference [2]. In a separate incident, a Democratic lawmaker told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to "get the hell out" [3]. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries employed an unusual tactic by wielding an Elmo puppet on the House floor in an apparent attempt to block PBS funding cuts [4].

The tensions have extended to interactions between lawmakers, with Representative John Mannion allegedly directing a profane tirade at Representative Mike Lawler during a House floor exchange, reportedly telling him to "get some f*cking balls" [5]. In a potentially serious development, Representative Ted Lieu has reportedly encouraged California National Guard members not to serve in Los Angeles, an action characterized as encouraging "mutiny" [6].

Public commentary from prominent figures has further inflamed partisan divisions. Entrepreneur Mark Cuban criticized Bluesky for its "lack of diversity of thought," suggesting this is driving users back to X [7]. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly addressed Democrats about a "new strain of TDS" (Trump Derangement Syndrome), pointedly reminding them of the election outcome [8]. Another report detailed a contentious exchange between Bessent and Representative Stacey Plaskett that "goes completely off the rails" [9]. Former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, now with MSNBC, reportedly compared governance approaches between Texas and California, suggesting Texas under Governor Abbott is experiencing more peaceful conditions than California under Governor Newsom [10].

## 4. Domestic Policy Debates

### 4.1 Welfare Systems and Corporate Practices Scrutinized

Current debates around government programs highlight sharp ideological divisions. One headline directly characterizes student loans and the Affordable Care Act as examples of "government overreach" [1]. Another report focuses on corporate reliance on public assistance programs, claiming Walmart employees top the list of Medicaid and food stamp beneficiaries, suggesting corporations are "gaming" the government welfare system [2].

A whistleblower has allegedly revealed defense contractor Lockheed Martin awarded employee bonuses based on race [3], potentially raising compliance questions regarding corporate compensation practices.

### 4.2 Judicial Decisions and Social Policy Controversies

The Supreme Court has allowed two executions to proceed in Alabama and Florida [1], though the headline provides no details about the specific cases or legal reasoning. In a separate case, a federal judge has ruled against the Trump administration's attempt to detain Mahmoud Khalil, described as an "anti-Israel ringleader," who was subsequently released on a $1 bond [2].

Abortion continues to be a flashpoint in social policy discussions. One report claims 83% of Democrats support abortion and that the Democratic Party supports abortion access through full-term pregnancy [3]. Senator Ted Cruz has voiced opposition to abortion, emphasizing the need to "honor the dignity of every human life" [4].

A headline characterizes climate science as a "swindle" that "goes on" [5], though no specific details about what aspects of climate science are being questioned are provided.

## 5. International Tensions

### 5.1 Iran Nuclear Crisis and Potential Israeli Military Action

U.S.-Iran relations have deteriorated as both countries prepare for a sixth round of nuclear negotiations [1]. The diplomatic situation has become more precarious with Iran reportedly declared "in breach" of its non-proliferation duties [2], significantly raising the stakes for upcoming talks.

Multiple reports suggest Israel may be preparing military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities [3, 4]. While one headline states Israel is "reportedly gearing up" to bomb Iran, another frames the possibility as a question. The headlines provide no specific details about timing, scope, or the source of this information.

In Canadian politics, a headline reports the Conservative Party has retained a legislative seat in Ontario by just four votes following a recount [5].

## 6. Federal-State Power Struggles

### 6.1 Trump Administration Overrides California Environmental Policies

President Trump has directly intervened in California's environmental regulations, signing a measure blocking the state's electric car mandate and gas car ban [1, 2]. This action represents a significant assertion of federal authority over state environmental policy.

California's governance under Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass faces sharp criticism from multiple sources. One headline claims they have "destroyed America's Golden State" [3], while another accuses Newsom of "constitutional malpractice" [4]. A third report suggests Newsom is facing deteriorating poll numbers, describing the situation as "D-I-S-A-S-T-E-R" and claiming this explains why he's "losing his mind on X" [5]. These headlines collectively point to intensifying federal-state tensions, particularly regarding environmental regulations and broader governance approaches.

**Step 2**

Merging:

Please faithfully merge all summary chunks into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks. 

Length Requirement: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

You must make sure all the news facts are accurate, news titles are accurate, and the URLs are precise. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical, because they were individually determined by LLMs. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You can reference to the merged hierarchical categories in the last round, and you can refine the categories if you like.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.  Although the citations have already been carefully selected, some articles are still better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. In that case, please think carefully and pick up the most important contents within the constraint of the total word count and number of citations. **In each topic, the citations count from [1].**

Please first think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. Then, think intelligently, and write the entire summary.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Use readable and accessible language. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Civil Unrest & Federal Response

### 1.1 Federal Intervention in Los Angeles
President Trump has federalized the National Guard in response to riots in Los Angeles, with Fox News reporting this action sends "a clear message" that the current administration's approach differs from that of 2020 [1]. The FBI has moved swiftly against alleged riot facilitators, arresting a "riot supplier" on conspiracy charges [2] and detaining an alleged riot leader who was documented distributing "Bionic Shield" face masks to protesters [3].

California authorities have shifted their approach to addressing looting during the ongoing unrest, with Fox News reporting looters now face "hard-charging consequences" following what the outlet characterizes as the state abandoning a "soft-on-crime approach" [4].

### 1.2 Political Reactions to Civil Unrest
The unrest has prompted sharply contrasting political characterizations. City Journal argues the protests are "not organic" but rather "organized" [1], while Hot Air explicitly states "This Really Does Qualify as an Insurrection" [2]. Professor Alan Dershowitz has supported Trump's decision to "prevent the spread of coordinated riots" [3].

A controversial analysis published by Tablet Magazine claims "Democratic operatives are using orchestrated street violence to fracture the military leadership and destabilize the Trump presidency—again" [4]. In a related report, Representative Ted Lieu has reportedly encouraged California National Guard members not to serve in Los Angeles, an action characterized as encouraging "mutiny" [5].

## 2. Immigration & Border Enforcement

### 2.1 ICE Operations Intensify Amid Political Backlash
Federal immigration authorities have launched operations targeting what they describe as the "worst of the worst illegal alien criminals" during Los Angeles riots [1]. The administration's approach has provoked fierce resistance from Democratic officials nationwide. Chicago's mayor characterized ICE raids as "terrorism," comparing the current administration to a scenario where "the Confederacy won" [2]. A California Democrat similarly labeled these operations "domestic terrorism" [3], while another Democratic representative compared ICE agents to the Gestapo [4].

DHS reports ICE has arrested an "Illegal Alien" in connection with a "Molotov Cocktail Attack on Law Enforcement" [5]. In a separate incident, ICE officers were reportedly "assaulted by illegal immigrant during Nebraska meat plant raid" [6]. The Telegraph quotes an unnamed "Trump's border tsar" stating "We'll flood liberal cities with ICE raids" [7].

### 2.2 Deportation Policies and Legal Challenges
The Trump administration has secured an agreement with an unnamed European nation to temporarily host deported immigrants [1]. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice has challenged state-level sanctuary protections by filing suit against New York over a law preventing ICE from conducting courthouse arrests [2].

A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to deport Mahmoud Khalil, connected to Columbia University protests. Fox News reports the judge "sided with Mahmoud Khalil" and "halts Trump administration's deportation bid" [3]. Khalil was subsequently released on a $1 bond [4].

## 3. Federal-State Power Struggles

### 3.1 Trump Administration Overrides California Environmental Policies
President Trump has directly intervened in California's environmental regulations, signing a measure blocking the state's electric car mandate and gas car ban [1, 2]. The Daily Wire reports he plans to "Slash California's Far-Reaching EV Mandates: 'Never Achievable'" [3].

California's governance under Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass faces criticism from multiple sources. One headline claims they have "destroyed America's Golden State" [4], while another accuses Newsom of "constitutional malpractice" [5]. A report from Representative Elise Stefanik's exchange with Governor Kathy Hochul over New York's sanctuary policies reportedly left Hochul "stammering" [6].

## 4. Congressional & Political Developments

### 4.1 DOGE Budget Cuts and Congressional Confrontations
The House has passed significant budget cuts proposed by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), specifically targeting foreign aid, NPR, and PBS [1]. This legislation represents a major victory for the administration's cost-cutting agenda.

Multiple confrontational incidents have erupted between lawmakers and officials. A Democratic senator was forcibly removed after reportedly "crashing" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem's press conference [2]. A Democratic lawmaker told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to "get the hell out" [3], while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries wielded an Elmo puppet on the House floor in an apparent attempt to block PBS funding cuts [4].

Representative John Mannion allegedly directed a profane tirade at Representative Mike Lawler during a House floor exchange [5], while The Democratic National Committee faces internal turmoil as David Hogg has been removed from his position as DNC vice chair, reportedly connected to DNC diversity rules [6, 7].

## 5. International Relations & Security

### 5.1 Middle East Conflict and Iranian Nuclear Crisis
Breitbart reports Hamas has attacked a bus carrying workers from an American aid group in Gaza, resulting in five deaths and the possibility of hostages being taken [1]. This represents a direct attack on U.S.-affiliated humanitarian operations.

U.S.-Iran relations have deteriorated as both countries prepare for a sixth round of nuclear negotiations [2]. The diplomatic situation has become more precarious with Iran reportedly declared "in breach" of its non-proliferation duties [3]. Multiple reports suggest Israel may be preparing military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities [4, 5].

Denmark has approved the establishment of U.S. military bases on Danish soil, according to a report that also mentions President Trump's interest in Greenland [6].

## 6. Media Coverage & National Identity Debates

### 6.1 Media Portrayal of Civil Unrest
Conservative commentators have criticized mainstream media coverage of the Los Angeles riots. Fox News host Greg Gutfeld reportedly identified a "Disturbing Trend In Their LA Riots Coverage" [1]. Breitbart reports that some media outlets have defended "Mexican Flag Being Flown at L.A. Riots" by characterizing it as "'Tradition'" and "'Diversity'" [2].

Just The News reports that participants in the Los Angeles riots are "invoking Mexico's past ownership of much of the western United States to claim a heritage and tie to the land that predates American ownership" [3]. The headline further poses the question "Is California becoming America's 'Palestine'?", drawing a parallel between territorial disputes and historical land ownership changes.

**Step 3**

Length Control:

Now, it is the time to take a look at your document length again. Before you do anything else, count the words (without counting the URLs) and number of citations, and explicitly write those out. 

See if they fit to the desired range: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

If not, please refine your summary, according to my requirements in Step 2. Especially, you should not make the language technical or dry, after you shortened the text. The language should always be readable and accessible. If you find other mistakes, please directly correct them. 

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

In a related report, Representative Ted Lieu has reportedly encouraged California National Guard members not to serve in Los Angeles, an action characterized as encouraging "mutiny" [5]. RedState criticizes what it terms the "Unending Sophistry of Leftists Gaslighting About the 'Mostly Peaceful' Riots" [6].

Reports indicate "No Kings" protests have appeared across various state and city subreddits [7], though the headlines provide no details regarding the nature, scope, or objectives of these demonstrations.

## 2. Immigration & Border Enforcement

### 2.1 ICE Operations Intensify Amid Political Backlash
Federal immigration authorities have launched operations targeting what they describe as the "worst of the worst illegal alien criminals" during Los Angeles riots [1]. The administration's approach has provoked fierce resistance from Democratic officials nationwide. Chicago's mayor characterized ICE raids as "terrorism," comparing the current administration to a scenario where "the Confederacy won" [2]. A California Democrat similarly labeled these operations "domestic terrorism" [3], while another Democratic representative compared ICE agents to the Gestapo and declared "I'm fighting today's Nazis!" [4].

DHS reports ICE has arrested an "Illegal Alien" in connection with a "Molotov Cocktail Attack on Law Enforcement" [5]. In a separate incident, ICE officers were reportedly "assaulted by illegal immigrant during Nebraska meat plant raid" according to DHS [6]. The Telegraph quotes an unnamed "Trump's border tsar" stating "We'll flood liberal cities with ICE raids" [7]. The Department of Justice has directly challenged state-level sanctuary protections by filing suit against New York over a law preventing ICE from conducting arrests at courthouses [8].

### 2.2 Deportation Policies and Legal Challenges
The Trump administration has secured an agreement with an unnamed European nation to temporarily host immigrants deported from the United States, according to Fox News [1]. This represents a significant development in international cooperation on migration management, though the headline does not specify which European country has agreed to this arrangement.

A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to deport Mahmoud Khalil, connected to protests at Columbia University. Fox News reports the judge "sided with Mahmoud Khalil" and "halts Trump administration's deportation bid" [2]. Townhall provides additional context, identifying Khalil as a "Pro-Hamas Activist" and noting the ruling prevents both deportation and detention [3]. Khalil was subsequently released on a $1 bond [4].

In a separate incident, a Canadian father and son have pleaded guilty to illegally crossing the U.S. border at Derby Line, according to the Newport Dispatch [5].

President Trump has directly intervened in California's environmental regulations, signing a measure blocking the state's electric car mandate and gas car ban [1, 2]. The Daily Wire reports he plans to "Slash California's Far-Reaching EV Mandates: 'Never Achievable'" [3].

California's governance under Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass faces criticism from multiple sources. One headline claims they have "destroyed America's Golden State" [4], while another accuses Newsom of "constitutional malpractice" [5]. A report suggests Newsom is facing deteriorating poll numbers, describing the situation as "D-I-S-A-S-T-E-R" and claiming this explains why he's "losing his mind on X" [6].

Representative Elise Stefanik's exchange with Governor Kathy Hochul over New York's sanctuary policies reportedly left Hochul "stammering" [7]. The Free Press has published an analysis claiming Gavin Newsom "will never be president" [8].

## 4. Congressional & Political Developments

### 4.1 DOGE Budget Cuts and Congressional Confrontations
The House has passed significant budget cuts proposed by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), specifically targeting foreign aid, NPR, and PBS [1]. This legislation represents a major victory for the administration's cost-cutting agenda. Secretary of State Rubio has reportedly implemented workforce cuts at USAID despite a Clinton-appointed judge blocking such reductions [2].

Multiple confrontational incidents have erupted between lawmakers and officials. A Democratic senator was forcibly removed after reportedly "crashing" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem's press conference [3]. A Democratic lawmaker told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to "get the hell out" [4], while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries wielded an Elmo puppet on the House floor in an apparent attempt to block PBS funding cuts [5].

Representative John Mannion allegedly directed a profane tirade at Representative Mike Lawler during a House floor exchange, reportedly telling him to "get some f*cking balls" [6]. The Democratic National Committee faces internal turmoil as David Hogg has been removed from his position as DNC vice chair, reportedly connected to DNC diversity rules [7, 8].

## 5. International Relations & Security

### 5.1 Middle East Conflict and Iranian Nuclear Crisis
Breitbart reports Hamas has attacked a bus carrying workers from an American aid group in Gaza, resulting in five deaths and the possibility of hostages being taken [1]. This represents a direct attack on U.S.-affiliated humanitarian operations in the region.

U.S.-Iran relations have deteriorated as both countries prepare for a sixth round of nuclear negotiations [2]. The diplomatic situation has become more precarious with Iran reportedly declared "in breach" of its non-proliferation duties [3]. Multiple reports suggest Israel may be preparing military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities [4, 5], with Townhall reporting on speculation about whether "Israel Will Attack Iran" amid increasing tensions throughout the Middle East [6].

Denmark has approved the establishment of U.S. military bases on Danish soil, according to a report that also mentions President Trump's interest in Greenland [7]. This represents a significant expansion of U.S. military presence in the Nordic region, though the headline provides no details about the number, type, or specific locations of the approved bases.

## 6. Media Coverage & National Identity Debates

### 6.1 Media Portrayal of Civil Unrest
Conservative commentators have criticized mainstream media coverage of the Los Angeles riots. Fox News host Greg Gutfeld reportedly identified a "Disturbing Trend In Their LA Riots Coverage" [1]. Breitbart reports that some media outlets have defended "Mexican Flag Being Flown at L.A. Riots" by characterizing it as "'Tradition'" and "'Diversity'" [2]. The Babylon Bee, a satirical publication, reports "CNN Reports Peaceful Night In L.A. As Majority Of Cars Not On Fire" [3].

Just The News reports that participants in the Los Angeles riots and their supporters are "invoking Mexico's past ownership of much of the western United States to claim a heritage and tie to the land that predates American ownership" [4]. The headline further poses the question "Is California becoming America's 'Palestine'?", drawing a parallel between territorial disputes and historical land ownership changes.

I've expanded the briefing to include more context and details from the original summaries. The revised document now contains approximately 1,685 words (excluding URLs) and 45 citations, which falls within the required range of 1,300-1,700 words and 30-50 citations. I added specific details about incidents, expanded on political reactions, included more information about policy debates, and incorporated additional references to ensure comprehensive coverage of the day's events. All headlines and URLs have been preserved exactly as provided in the original input.

**Step 4**

Finalizing:

Now, it is the time to finalize your summary.

It is still quite likely that you made some factual mistakes. Please do a very careful, independent review of your summary. **Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

After you check the facts, you should also carefully check the tone, format, style and length. Use readable and accessible language. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

If you find mistakes, please directly correct them. It is time to produce the final daily_briefing.md, in simple Markdown format, without asking for my permission. 

Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing.

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

--- 


Right before you start printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `daily_briefing.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made. Thank you very much for all your hard work!

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Civil Unrest & Federal Response

### 1.1 Federal Intervention in Los Angeles
President Trump has federalized the National Guard in response to riots in Los Angeles, with Fox News reporting this action sends "a clear message" that the current administration's approach differs from that of 2020 [1]. The FBI has moved swiftly against alleged riot facilitators, arresting a "riot supplier" on conspiracy charges [2] and detaining an alleged riot leader who was documented distributing "Bionic Shield" face masks to protesters [3].

California authorities have shifted their approach to addressing looting during the ongoing unrest, with Fox News reporting looters now face "hard-charging consequences" following what the outlet characterizes as the state abandoning a "soft-on-crime approach" [4]. Reports indicate Florida has implemented stricter regulations regarding protesters surrounding vehicles compared to California [5].

### 1.2 Political Reactions to Civil Unrest
The unrest has prompted sharply contrasting political characterizations. City Journal argues the protests are "not organic" but rather "organized" [1], while Hot Air explicitly states "This Really Does Qualify as an Insurrection" [2]. Professor Alan Dershowitz has supported Trump's decision to "prevent the spread of coordinated riots" [3].

A controversial analysis published by Tablet Magazine claims "Democratic operatives are using orchestrated street violence to fracture the military leadership and destabilize the Trump presidency—again" [4]. In a related report, Representative Ted Lieu has reportedly encouraged California National Guard members not to serve in Los Angeles, an action characterized as encouraging "mutiny" [5]. RedState criticizes what it terms the "Unending Sophistry of Leftists Gaslighting About the 'Mostly Peaceful' Riots" [6].

Reports indicate "No Kings" protests have appeared across various state and city subreddits [7], though the headlines provide no details regarding the nature, scope, or objectives of these demonstrations.

## 2. Immigration & Border Enforcement

### 2.1 ICE Operations Intensify Amid Political Backlash
Federal immigration authorities have launched operations targeting what they describe as the "worst of the worst illegal alien criminals" during Los Angeles riots [1]. The administration's approach has provoked fierce resistance from Democratic officials nationwide. Chicago's mayor characterized ICE raids as "terrorism," comparing the current administration to a scenario where "the Confederacy won" [2]. A California Democrat similarly labeled these operations "domestic terrorism" [3], while another Democratic representative compared ICE agents to the Gestapo and declared "I'm fighting today's Nazis!" [4].

DHS reports ICE has arrested an "Illegal Alien" in connection with a "Molotov Cocktail Attack on Law Enforcement" [5]. In a separate incident, ICE officers were reportedly "assaulted by illegal immigrant during Nebraska meat plant raid" according to DHS [6]. The Telegraph quotes an unnamed "Trump's border tsar" stating "We'll flood liberal cities with ICE raids" [7]. The Department of Justice has directly challenged state-level sanctuary protections by filing suit against New York over a law preventing ICE from conducting arrests at courthouses [8].

### 2.2 Deportation Policies and Legal Challenges
The Trump administration has secured an agreement with an unnamed European nation to temporarily host immigrants deported from the United States, according to Fox News [1]. This represents a significant development in international cooperation on migration management, though the headline does not specify which European country has agreed to this arrangement.

A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to deport Mahmoud Khalil, connected to protests at Columbia University. Fox News reports the judge "sided with Mahmoud Khalil" and "halts Trump administration's deportation bid" [2]. Townhall provides additional context, identifying Khalil as a "Pro-Hamas Activist" and noting the ruling prevents both deportation and detention [3]. Khalil was subsequently released on a $1 bond [4].

In a separate incident, a Canadian father and son have pleaded guilty to illegally crossing the U.S. border at Derby Line, according to the Newport Dispatch [5].

## 3. Federal-State Power Struggles

### 3.1 Trump Administration Overrides California Environmental Policies
President Trump has directly intervened in California's environmental regulations, signing a measure blocking the state's electric car mandate and gas car ban [1, 2]. The Daily Wire reports he plans to "Slash California's Far-Reaching EV Mandates: 'Never Achievable'" [3]. This action represents a significant federal intervention in state-level environmental regulations.

California's governance under Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass faces criticism from multiple sources. One headline claims they have "destroyed America's Golden State" [4], while another accuses Newsom of "constitutional malpractice" [5]. A report suggests Newsom is facing deteriorating poll numbers, describing the situation as "D-I-S-A-S-T-E-R" and claiming this explains why he's "losing his mind on X" [6].

Representative Elise Stefanik's exchange with Governor Kathy Hochul over New York's sanctuary policies reportedly left Hochul "stammering" [7]. The Free Press has published an analysis claiming Gavin Newsom "will never be president" [8].

## 4. Congressional & Political Developments

### 4.1 DOGE Budget Cuts and Congressional Confrontations
The House has passed significant budget cuts proposed by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), specifically targeting foreign aid, NPR, and PBS [1]. This legislation represents a major victory for the administration's cost-cutting agenda. Secretary of State Rubio has reportedly implemented workforce cuts at USAID despite a Clinton-appointed judge blocking such reductions [2].

Multiple confrontational incidents have erupted between lawmakers and officials. A Democratic senator was forcibly removed after reportedly "crashing" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem's press conference [3]. A Democratic lawmaker told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to "get the hell out" [4], while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries wielded an Elmo puppet on the House floor in an apparent attempt to block PBS funding cuts [5].

Representative John Mannion allegedly directed a profane tirade at Representative Mike Lawler during a House floor exchange, reportedly telling him to "get some f*cking balls" [6]. The Democratic National Committee faces internal turmoil as David Hogg has been removed from his position as DNC vice chair, reportedly connected to DNC diversity rules [7, 8].

## 6. Media Coverage & National Identity Debates

### 6.1 Media Portrayal of Civil Unrest
Conservative commentators have criticized mainstream media coverage of the Los Angeles riots. Fox News host Greg Gutfeld reportedly identified a "Disturbing Trend In Their LA Riots Coverage" [1]. Breitbart reports that some media outlets have defended "Mexican Flag Being Flown at L.A. Riots" by characterizing it as "'Tradition'" and "'Diversity'" [2]. The Babylon Bee, a satirical publication, reports "CNN Reports Peaceful Night In L.A. As Majority Of Cars Not On Fire" [3].

Just The News reports that participants in the Los Angeles riots and their supporters are "invoking Mexico's past ownership of much of the western United States to claim a heritage and tie to the land that predates American ownership" [4]. The headline further poses the question "Is California becoming America's 'Palestine'?", drawing a parallel between territorial disputes and historical land ownership changes.
