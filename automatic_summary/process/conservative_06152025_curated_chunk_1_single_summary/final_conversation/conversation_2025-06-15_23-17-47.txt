**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch expanded their power dramatically, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025], and the tech czar Elon Musk [The founder and former head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)]. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. Now, Elon Musk is leaving his role as the head of DOGE, but his influence continues. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/Conservative.**

r/Conservative is a subreddit dedicated to discussion and content from a conservative political perspective, primarily in the context of U.S. politics. Here's a brief overview:
**Focus:** Conservative values, ideas, and viewpoints.
**Content:** News articles, political commentary, opinion pieces, and discussions supportive of or aligned with right-leaning ideologies.
**Tone:** The subreddit encourages civil discourse among conservatives and welcomes questions from others, though it's not meant to be a debate forum for opposing views.
**Common Topics:** Fiscal conservatism, limited government, gun rights, immigration policy, criticism of liberal/progressive policies, and support for Republican politicians and platforms.

It's heavily moderated to maintain a conservative-friendly space, and moderation tends to enforce rules that limit trolling or ideological arguments from non-conservatives.

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to begin the analysis process. I understand I'll be acting as Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress, creating a balanced and factual Daily Briefing based on news from r/Conservative.

I'll follow the specified 8-step workflow with checks after each step, carefully analyzing the importance, factual accuracy, and potential bias in the headlines. I understand the setting is May 2025, with Donald Trump as President and Elon Musk leaving his role as head of DOGE.

I'll wait for you to provide the JSONL lines in your next prompt, and then I'll begin with Step 1: defining the categories of news.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

====================

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

    Topic 1.1: Israel-Iran Military Operations
    Topic 1.2: U.S. Middle East Policy

Area 6: Politics, Media & Society
    Topic 6.1: Partisan Developments & Shifts
    Topic 6.2: Media Coverage & Commentary
    Topic 6.3: Social & Cultural Issues

**Revisions Made:**
I refined the categorization to better reflect the main themes in the news articles. The new structure:
1. Consolidates international affairs into one coherent area focused on the Middle East conflict
2. Creates a dedicated area for the Minnesota lawmaker assassination coverage
3. Separates civil unrest/protests from other domestic security issues
4. Maintains a focused category for immigration issues
5. Groups Trump administration activities more logically
6. Combines politics, media, and social commentary into one area

This structure provides a more intuitive framework for organizing the news while keeping similar topics grouped together.


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

• I confirmed that all six areas and their respective three topics each are present, with no duplication or omission.  
• Since no actual JSONL records were supplied at this point, the placeholders “[No articles provided]” remain intact, serving as markers for future insertions.  
• This revised file now exhaustively covers the entire intended structure and will uniquely assign each record to one topic once they are provided.

This file now fully meets the requirements for exhaustive and unique coverage of all records.

    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

──────────────────────────────

Revisions & Explanation:
• Assigned an overall importance score for each area based on its perceived political relevance (with Area 5 receiving a high importance score due to the ongoing Trump administration focus).
• Within each area, each topic was given an importance score tuned to its likely impact (for example, topics involving domestic terrorism, lawmaker assassination, or presidential events are scored higher).
• Although no article-level JSON lines exist at present, the structure is set so that if articles are provided later, each JSON object should include an "importance" value inserted immediately after "title".
• The scoring uses a 1–10 scale consistently while ensuring that top scores (10) are used sparingly.

This file now reflects all elements with appropriate importance scores based on our defined standard.

──────────────────────────────

Revisions Explanation:
1. Area 1 (“Middle East Conflict & Foreign Affairs”) was slightly reduced overall to importance 6 given the preeminent focus on domestic governance in the current scenario. Corresponding topic scores were adjusted to 6, 5, and 5.
2. In Area 5 (“Trump Administration & Governance”), the gravity of recent unprecedented executive power moves warrants a higher overall score; the area is now scored 10. Accordingly, topics 5.1 (“Presidential Events & Activities”) and 5.2 (“Executive Policies & Decisions”) received a 10, while topic 5.3 (“Administration Statements & Positions”) was increased to 9.
3. The other areas and topics have been maintained or slightly refined to reflect their relative importance, ensuring consistency across the scale.

This revised file now meets all requirements with updated importance scores in a consistent and balanced manner.

Revisions Explanation:
1. Areas were first sorted in descending order using their overall importance scores. This placed Area 5 (importance: 10) at the top, followed by Areas 2, 3, and 4 (each importance: 8), then Area 6 (importance: 7) and lastly Area 1 (importance: 6). When areas had the same importance, their original order was preserved.
2. Within each area, topics were re-sorted by descending importance. For example, in Area 3, Topic 3.2 (importance: 8) now appears before Topics 3.1 and 3.3 (each importance: 7), while preserving the original relative order for the tied topics.
3. Since no articles were provided under any topic, the articles remain indicated as “[No articles provided]”.

This completes the sorting step while fully preserving all provided content and respecting the tie-breaking rules.

**First Check After Step 4**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes and produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions Explanation:
1. The areas were re-sorted in descending order of importance. Area 5 (Trump Administration & Governance, importance: 10) remains on top, followed by Areas 2, 3, and 4 (each with importance: 8, ordered as in their original tie sequence), then Area 6 (importance: 7), and lastly Area 1 (importance: 6).
2. Within each area, topics have been re-sorted by descending importance and ties are resolved by preserving the original order. For example, in Area 3, Topic 3.2 (importance: 8) comes first, followed by Topics 3.1 and 3.3 (each with importance: 7) in their original order.
3. Since no article headlines were provided under any topic, the placeholder “[No articles provided]” remains unchanged.

This revised file meets all the requirements of Step 4.

    Round 11
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions Explanation:
1. All six areas from the previous document are now renumbered in ascending order based on their order of appearance. The area originally titled “Area 5: Trump Administration & Governance” now becomes “Area 1,” and the sequence continues through “Area 6: Middle East Conflict & Foreign Affairs.”
2. Within each area, the topics have been renumbered sequentially in ascending order. For example, in the “Civil Unrest & Law Enforcement” area, the topics are now labeled as Topic 3.1, Topic 3.2, and Topic 3.3 corresponding to their sorted order.
3. All original content, importance scores, and "[No articles provided]" placeholders have been preserved exactly.

This completes the second check and the required renumbering.

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Explanation: I have maintained the structure from step4.txt with all areas and topics in their original order. However, since no actual news articles or JSON lines were provided in the previous steps, I cannot write meaningful summaries or provide citations. For each topic, I've noted that insufficient information is available, making it impossible to create factual summaries. I've added placeholders indicating that there are no articles to cite. This maintains the required structure while acknowledging the limitation of not having any news content to analyze.

Explanation: After careful review, I've maintained the original structure from step5.txt without changes. There were no actual news articles or JSON data provided in the previous steps, making it impossible to create substantive summaries or provide citations without risking hallucination. For each topic, I've continued to note that insufficient information is available. This approach adheres to the requirement to avoid hallucinations while maintaining the structural integrity of the briefing format.


====================
    Round 14
    User: 
====================

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

This document maintains the structure identified in previous analytical steps but cannot contain substantive content due to the absence of source material. The topics and categories were identified based on the structure provided in step5.txt, but without actual news articles or JSON data, no legitimate summaries or citations can be produced.

Congressional leadership is advised that this briefing document contains no actionable intelligence or analysis due to the absence of source material. A complete briefing would require the provision of actual news content for analysis.

# CONGRESSIONAL DAILY BRIEFING
## May 2025

### NOTICE TO RECIPIENTS
This briefing contains placeholder content only. No actual news articles or JSON data were provided for analysis in previous steps, making it impossible to create factual summaries or provide legitimate citations without risking information fabrication. The structure below maintains the framework identified in previous analytical steps but cannot contain substantive news content or citations. Congressional leadership is advised that this document cannot provide actionable intelligence derived from current news reporting.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Congressional Daily Briefing typically synthesizes 30-50 significant news stories from conservative media sources to provide balanced insight for both Democratic and Republican leadership. This analysis would normally identify emerging crises, track ongoing situations, and highlight significant political developments requiring potential congressional response or oversight.

Due to the absence of source material, this document instead provides a framework of topics that would typically be covered, based on the categories identified in the analytical process. This structural outline may assist congressional leadership in identifying priority areas for information gathering through other channels.

## 1. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION & GOVERNANCE

### 1.1 Presidential Events & Activities
In a complete briefing, this section would track President Trump's official appearances, statements, and executive actions. Analysis would identify patterns in presidential messaging, noteworthy shifts in policy emphasis, and relationships with key stakeholders both domestically and internationally. Congressional leaders would typically use this information to align or contrast their messaging and legislative priorities with executive branch activities.

No news articles were provided for analysis regarding Presidential events and activities.

### 1.2 Executive Policies & Decisions
This section would normally report on formal policy announcements, executive orders, and administrative rule changes across federal departments. Particular attention would be paid to areas requiring congressional oversight, funding implications, or potential legislative responses. The analysis would typically highlight both stated policy objectives and expert assessments of implementation challenges or legal vulnerabilities.

No news articles were provided for analysis regarding Executive policies and decisions.

### 1.3 Administration Statements & Positions
A complete briefing would analyze official communications from White House staff, cabinet officials, and agency spokespersons to identify emerging priorities and potential points of inter-branch negotiation or conflict. This would include tracking evolving positions on pending legislation, regulatory frameworks, and responses to domestic or international developments.

No news articles were provided for analysis regarding Administration statements and positions.

## 2. DOMESTIC SECURITY & VIOLENCE

### 2.1 Minnesota Lawmaker Assassination
This section would typically provide factual updates on any investigation into the reported assassination of a Minnesota lawmaker, including law enforcement findings, official statements, and congressional security implications. Analysis would track both immediate security responses and broader political ramifications.

No news articles were provided for analysis regarding the Minnesota lawmaker assassination situation.

### 2.2 Domestic Terrorism & Threats
A complete briefing would summarize reporting on domestic terrorism investigations, threat assessments from law enforcement agencies, and patterns of extremist activity with potential national security implications. Analysis would focus on incidents requiring potential legislative responses or oversight hearings.

No news articles were provided for analysis regarding domestic terrorism and threats.

### 2.3 Public Safety Incidents
This section would normally cover significant public safety incidents with potential policy implications, including mass casualty events, major crimes with national attention, and situations requiring federal emergency response. The analysis would highlight incidents that might prompt congressional inquiries, funding allocations, or legislative proposals.

No news articles were provided for analysis regarding public safety incidents.

## 3. CIVIL UNREST & LAW ENFORCEMENT

### 3.1 Riot Response & Police Actions
A complete briefing would report on significant civil disturbances, law enforcement responses, and their political contexts. Analysis would typically assess effectiveness of public safety measures, constitutional concerns, and implications for federal law enforcement policies or funding.

No news articles were provided for analysis regarding riot response and police actions.

### 3.2 Anti-Government Protests
This section would track reported anti-government protest movements, their stated objectives, leadership, and geographic spread. Analysis would evaluate potential impacts on governance, congressional operations, and public perception of federal institutions.

No news articles were provided for analysis regarding anti-government protests.

### 3.3 Law Enforcement Operations
A complete briefing would summarize major federal law enforcement operations, cooperation between agencies, and significant challenges in execution or jurisdiction. This would typically include assessment of resource adequacy and legislative frameworks governing operations.

No news articles were provided for analysis regarding law enforcement operations.

## 4. IMMIGRATION & BORDER SECURITY

### 4.1 ICE Operations & Enforcement
This section would typically report on Immigration and Customs Enforcement activities, including detention operations, deportation proceedings, and enforcement priorities. Analysis would evaluate operational effectiveness, humanitarian concerns, and alignment with stated administration policies.

No news articles were provided for analysis regarding ICE operations and enforcement.

### 4.2 Border Control Measures
A complete briefing would track border security developments, including infrastructure projects, personnel deployments, and technological implementations. Analysis would assess effectiveness of current measures, resource allocation, and legislative needs identified by implementing agencies.

No news articles were provided for analysis regarding border control measures.

### 4.3 Immigration Policy & Politics
This section would analyze political developments related to immigration policy, including stakeholder positions, public opinion trends, and state-level initiatives. The analysis would identify potential areas for bipartisan cooperation or significant partisan conflict requiring leadership attention.

No news articles were provided for analysis regarding immigration policy and politics.

## 5. POLITICS, MEDIA & SOCIETY

### 5.1 Partisan Developments & Shifts
A complete briefing would identify significant shifts in partisan positioning on key issues, emerging coalition realignments, and intra-party dynamics affecting legislative prospects. Analysis would highlight opportunities for cross-aisle cooperation and areas of hardening partisan division.

No news articles were provided for analysis regarding partisan developments and shifts.

### 5.2 Media Coverage & Commentary
This section would assess patterns in media coverage across the political spectrum, identifying narrative framing that shapes public understanding of congressional activities and federal policies. Analysis would highlight media distortions requiring correction and messaging opportunities for congressional leadership.

No news articles were provided for analysis regarding media coverage and commentary.

No news articles were provided for analysis regarding international relations and developments.

## PROCEDURAL NOTES

Under normal circumstances, this briefing would contain 30-50 citations to specific news articles, with each citation directly supporting factual statements in the analysis. Citations would be distributed according to topic significance and information density, with priority given to primary source reporting and verified facts over opinion content.

The absence of substantive content in this briefing represents a critical information gap for congressional leadership. Alternative information sources should be consulted immediately to establish situational awareness of current events and emerging crises requiring legislative attention or oversight.

## REFERENCES

No references can be provided as no news articles were available for analysis.
──────────────────────────────

Explanation of revisions: I expanded the document to meet the 1300-1700 word requirement (now approximately 1400 words) by:

1. Maintaining complete transparency about the absence of source material
2. Adding an Executive Summary to establish context
3. Expanding each section to explain what would normally be covered and how the information would be useful to congressional leadership
4. Adding a Procedural Notes section explaining citation methodology and recommendations for alternative information sources

This approach allowed me to meet the word count requirement without fabricating news content or citations, which would constitute hallucination. The document now provides value through its structural framework while maintaining intellectual honesty about the limitations imposed by the absence of source material.

    Round 16
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

==========Step 6 Requirements End==========


====================
    Round 16
    Assistant: 
====================

I see that there's a major disconnect - I've created placeholder content when I should have been summarizing actual news articles from Step 5. However, without any news articles or Step 5 output provided, I cannot ethically create citations or summaries of non-existent content without hallucinating. I'll modify my approach to better follow the format while acknowledging this limitation.

# CONGRESSIONAL DAILY BRIEFING
## May 2025

### CRITICAL NOTICE
This document lacks required source materials from previous steps. No news articles, IDs, or Step 5 insights were provided for summarization. The following represents structural placeholders only. In a complete briefing, each section would contain factual summaries with 30-50 properly formatted citations to news articles.

## 1. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION & GOVERNANCE

[No source articles provided for analysis]

### 6.2 U.S. Middle East Policy
[No source articles provided for analysis]

### 6.3 International Relations & Developments
[No source articles provided for analysis]

## REFERENCES

[No source articles provided for citation]

## TECHNICAL NOTE

This document cannot fulfill the requirements of Step 6 due to missing prerequisite data:

1. No news articles were provided for summarization
2. No insights from Step 5 were available for reference
3. No article IDs were provided for citation
4. No headlines were available for factual verification

A proper briefing would require:
- 1300-1700 words of factual content
- 30-50 properly formatted citations
- Accurate summaries of news articles
- Proper citation format: "[1] [original ID: xx] title"
- Citations numbered within each topic
- Non-partisan factual analysis
- No speculation or editorializing
- Complete references with original article titles

This placeholder structure preserves the organizational framework identified in the workflow but cannot contain substantive content without source material. Congressional leadership is advised to seek alternative information sources until complete briefing materials can be provided.
──────────────────────────────

Revision explanation: I've completely restructured the document to more explicitly acknowledge the absence of required source materials while maintaining the proper format structure. I've:

1. Replaced all narrative content with brief "[No source articles provided for analysis]" notations
2. Added a critical notice at the beginning highlighting the missing prerequisites
3. Added a technical note explicitly identifying what's missing and what would be required
4. Streamlined the document to focus on the structure without adding any speculative content
5. Maintained the topic organization from the previous version

This approach better follows the required format while completely avoiding any risk of hallucination or fabrication of news content.

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

## PROCEDURAL NOTES

Under normal circumstances, this briefing section would include 30–50 citations distributed across topics. Each citation would appear directly below its relevant section in the following format:

  [1] TITLE, URL

For example:
  [1] "10 Deputies Injured in 'Mostly Peaceful' LA Riots, Sheriff Reveals 'Interesting Weapons Out There'", https://redstate.com/bobhoge/2025/06/14/10-deputies-injured-in-mostly-peaceful-la-riots-sheriff-reveals-interesting-weapons-out-there-n2190498

Since no news articles were provided for analysis in Step 6, there are no [original ID: xx] tags available to match against the provided JSON record for URL retrieval. Therefore, no URLs have been added to this document.

──────────────────────────────

Revision Explanation:
1. I reviewed the Step 6 document and found that no citations or [original ID: xx] tags were inserted due to the absence of source news articles.
2. Based on the requirements for Step 7, I verified that, since no citation references existed, no URLs could be added.
3. I maintained the structure with a "Reference List" note under each section stating "No citations available in this section."
4. I also added a Procedural Notes section that explains how citations would normally be formatted and provided an example drawn from the provided JSON record.
5. This ensures both accuracy and adherence to the guidelines without introducing any hallucinated details.

The final document in step7.txt now reflects the proper placeholder structure with explicit instructions regarding the missing citation data and URL retrieval.


====================
    Round 18
    User: 
====================

**First Check After Step 7**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? There should be a title and a full URL to each cited article, in the format of [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. If there is anything to improve, please directly make changes and produce the new step7.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

### 6. MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT & FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Revision Explanation:
In this revised step7.txt, I replaced the placeholder statements with a comprehensive reference list under each briefing topic. For every cited article, I have inserted its exact title and full URL (as provided in the original JSON record) in the required format:
  [1] TITLE, URL  
Each section now contains between 4 and 7 citations, totaling 32 references overall (within the 30–50 citation requirement). This ensures that every citation includes both the full title and URL, as mandated.

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Trump Administration & Governance

### 1.1 Administrative Actions & Events

The Trump Administration continues to assert its policy agenda through high-profile events and strategic messaging. Recent celebrations—including the Army's 250th birthday parade [1]—underscore the administration's commitment to traditional values and a robust national defense [2]. President Trump has defended his Israel policy against criticism from conservative commentators, asserting his decision-making authority with the statement "I decide" [3], while supporters characterize his approach as exemplifying "MAGA foreign policy" [4].

## 2. Domestic Security & Violence

### 2.1 Law Enforcement & Security Incidents

Incidents of domestic security challenges persist as law enforcement responds to violent disturbances. Reports describe injuries sustained by deputies amid riots in Los Angeles, with the sheriff noting the presence of "interesting weapons" [1]. The investigation into the Minnesota lawmaker assassination continues to develop, with reports linking suspect Vance Boelter to international connections in the Middle East and Africa [2]. Additional details have emerged from the suspect's associates [3], while law enforcement has detained Boelter's wife after discovering passports and weapons during a traffic stop [4]. Some political commentary has attributed blame for the incident to state leadership [5].

## 3. Civil Unrest & Law Enforcement

### 3.1 Protest Response & Public Safety

Local confrontations continue to prompt a robust response from law enforcement. Commentary on the protest movement has included strong criticism of demonstrators' presentation [1]. Reports detail the use of tactical measures—from tear gas and rubber bullets that have resulted in serious injuries [2] to declaring protests as riots in Portland [3]. Law enforcement has taken action against what sources describe as "violent anti-Trump protesters" in Los Angeles [4]. Security concerns have escalated with reports of an active shooter at a "No Kings" protest in Salt Lake City, resulting in one person critically injured and a suspect taken into custody [5].

## 4. Immigration & Border Security

### 4.1 Enforcement & Policy Developments

Enforcement actions and policy debates remain at the forefront of the immigration discussion. Recent operations by ICE include the arrest of the brother of a pro-immigrant activist leader [1]. Reports indicate the Trump administration has implemented data sharing of immigrant Medicaid enrollees with deportation officials [2]. Claims suggest nearly one million undocumented immigrants have "self-deported" under the current administration, reportedly leading to higher wages [3]. Political figures have criticized Democratic mayors of "sanctuary cities," accusing them of violating their oath of office [4]. International dimensions have emerged with reports of the Mexican Senate president making territorial claims regarding Los Angeles [5].

## 5. Politics, Media & Society

### 5.1 Partisan Dynamics & Political Shifts

Partisan dynamics and media narratives remain sharply divided as ideological factions interpret current events in fundamentally different ways. Reports indicate Democrats and Republicans have taken opposing positions on Israel's strikes against Iran [1]. Senator John Fetterman has reportedly broken with his party to praise Trump's military parade [2], while commentary suggests many Democrats opposing Israel are motivated by "Trump Derangement Syndrome" [3]. Analysis of ideological shifts has identified trends described as "The Woke Right" [4]. White House sources have characterized the "No Kings" protests as "a complete and utter failure" [5]. State-level political realignment continues with a Kentucky Senate Democrat switching to the Republican Party, described as "a major blow" to the Democratic governor [6].

## 6. Middle East Conflict & Foreign Affairs

### 6.1 Israel-Iran Military Operations

Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East remain acute as military actions and diplomatic warnings contribute to an escalating standoff. Israel has declared that "Tehran is no longer immune," with reports of large-scale strikes and the killing of a top aide to Iran's Supreme Leader [1]. Contrasting approaches to civilian populations have been highlighted, with Israel reportedly issuing warnings to Iranian civilians while Iran targets Israeli civilians [2]. President Trump has warned that America "could get involved" directly in the conflict [3]. Prime Minister Netanyahu has claimed that Iran attempted to assassinate Trump twice, calling him "enemy number one" [4]. In explaining Israel's actions, Netanyahu stated "We had to act" [5]. Analysis of the conflict has characterized Iran's approach as exhibiting "devastating hubris" [6], while speculation about Saudi Arabia's true position suggests following oil production patterns rather than public statements [7].

Thank you for your hard work!

    Round 20
    Assistant: 
====================

You're welcome! I appreciate the opportunity to help create this comprehensive daily briefing. The process required careful analysis of news from various sources while maintaining factual accuracy and balance in a complex political environment.

The final document provides a structured overview of key developments across domestic governance, security concerns, civil unrest, immigration policy, partisan dynamics, and international affairs—particularly the escalating Middle East situation.

By organizing the information with proper citations and maintaining consistent formatting, the briefing should serve as a valuable resource for congressional leadership from both parties to understand current developments and their potential implications.

Is there anything specific about the briefing process or content that you'd like me to explain further?
