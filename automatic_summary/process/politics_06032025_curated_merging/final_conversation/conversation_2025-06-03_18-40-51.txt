**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch expanded their power dramatically, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025], and the tech czar Elon Musk [The founder and former head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)]. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. Now, Elon Musk is leaving his role as the head of DOGE, but his influence continues. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

---

Because there are several hundreds of news articles posted in some subreddit communities every day, it is hard to summarize all of them in a single process. Fortunately, I have already broken the articles in that day into chunks by submission time in the 24 hour coverage window in ascending order, and generated summaries for each chunk with LLMs. Those detailed summary chunks will be posted here. Each has a length of 1300-1700 words without counting the URLs, and citing 30-50 news articles. 

The chunks are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, there are 4 chunks, and the news coverage cycle is from yesterday's 18:00 to today's 18:00. Chunk 1 is from the articles submitted between 18:00 of yesterday to 06:00 of today, Chunk 2 is for 06:00 to 10:00 today, Chunk 3 is for 10:00 to 14:00 today, and Chunk 4 is from 14:00 to 18:00 today. The first chunk is based on the earliest articles submitted to the subreddit community. The last chunk is based on the latest articles submitted. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in Chunk 2 **happen** after all the news stories in Chunk 1, just because they are **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from Chunk 1 and B from Chunk 2, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This rule applies to all chunks in sequential order. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from different chunks. 

**Your task is to critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks, and then faithfully merge all of them into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks.** 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

---

Please tell me if you are ready to receive the individual summaries. I will provide them all at once. And please follow my later instructions, be patient, do the work step by step.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I am ready to receive the individual summaries. I'll carefully analyze them and synthesize a comprehensive, objective Daily Briefing that both Democratic and Republican leadership can use to understand current crises and coordinate responses. I understand the importance of factual accuracy and will rely strictly on the information provided in the summaries, avoiding speculation when details are insufficient.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1**

Comparing:

Please critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks provided below. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You must use your limited length to summarize the most important news, while skipping the secondary.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.

Please carefully think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. **You will do the merging task in the next round with my detailed instructions. Please do not attempt to write down your summary at this step, because you haven't been given the full instructions yet!** It is always better to take some time to think clearly for such a difficult task, and make detailed plans for yourself, before taking any actions. You should use this opportunity to prepare yourself for your next round of work by writing down some notes for yourself.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Critical Notice

### 1.1 Briefing Production Failure

This Daily Briefing, normally prepared for both Democratic and Republican congressional leadership, cannot be produced in its standard format today. After thorough review, we must report that our analysis process has encountered a fundamental error: no news articles were provided to our analytical team for processing. This represents a critical breakdown in our information workflow.

*[No references available under this section, as no news articles were provided for analysis.]*  

## 2. Workflow Analysis

### 2.1 Standard Process Review

Our standard analytical process involves:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering news articles from the r/politics subreddit  
2. **Categorization**: Sorting articles into policy domains (completed in Step 1)  
3. **Article Assignment**: Placing articles within appropriate subcategories (completed in Step 2)  
4. **Importance Evaluation**: Scoring articles based on relevance criteria (completed in Step 3)  
5. **Prioritization**: Ranking articles by significance (completed in Step 4)  
6. **Content Synthesis**: Summarizing key insights (attempted in Step 5)  
7. **Final Composition**: Creating this comprehensive briefing (current step)

*[No references available under this section, as no news articles were provided for analysis.]*  

### 2.2 Disruption Assessment

The workflow disruption occurred between Steps 4 and 5, where our analytical team was unable to access any news content for summarization. Despite having established categories and processing frameworks, no actual news articles were available for analysis.

*[No references available under this section, as no news articles were provided for analysis.]*  

## 3. Implications and Context

### 3.1 Leadership Challenges

This information vacuum creates significant challenges for congressional leadership:

1. **Strategic Blindspot**: Leadership lacks visibility into developing situations that would normally appear in this briefing  
2. **Reactive Positioning**: Without current information, proactive policy responses become difficult  
3. **Message Coordination**: Party leadership may struggle to align messaging without awareness of emerging issues  
4. **Cross-Aisle Engagement**: Bipartisan coordination is hampered without a shared information baseline  
5. **Constituent Communication**: Representatives lack current context for addressing voter concerns

*[No references available under this section, as no news articles were provided for analysis.]*  

### 3.2 Executive Branch Transition

This briefing disruption coincides with a period of significant transition in the executive branch. As noted in our background materials, Elon Musk is departing his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a development that may be causing ripple effects throughout government information systems and communication channels.

While we cannot speculate on direct causation without evidence, the timing suggests possible correlation between DOGE leadership changes and information flow disruptions. Congressional leadership should be aware that administrative transitions may temporarily affect normal government operations across multiple domains.

*[No references available under this section, as no news articles were provided for analysis.]*  

## 4. Recovery and Recommendations

### 4.1 Alternative Intelligence Sources

Until our standard briefing capability is restored, we recommend congressional leadership utilize:

1. **Direct Executive Branch Communications**: Official White House, Cabinet, and agency statements

3. **Committee Staff Intelligence**: Specialized policy monitoring through committee channels  
4. **State/District Office Reporting**: Ground-level constituent concerns and local developments  
5. **Trusted Media Partnerships**: Direct outreach to established journalistic sources  
6. **Foreign Embassy Briefings**: For international developments affecting U.S. interests  
7. **Think Tank Analysis**: Policy-specific insights from research institutions  
8. **Technology Platform Direct Access**: Establishing temporary monitoring of key information sources

## 5. Authentication

### 5.1 Analytical Team Verification

This unusual briefing has been reviewed and authenticated by our full analytical leadership team to verify the accuracy of our workflow disruption assessment. We maintain our commitment to factual accuracy, non-partisan analysis, and service to congressional leadership during this information anomaly.

*[No references available under this section, as no news articles were provided for analysis.]*

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Trump Administration and Governance

### 1.1 International Relations

The Trump administration is actively navigating complex international negotiations on multiple fronts. An outline is emerging of the U.S. offer to Iran in high-stakes nuclear negotiations [1], though specific proposal details remain undisclosed. This represents a potentially significant shift in diplomatic engagement with Tehran.

President Trump appears intensely focused on establishing direct communication with Chinese President Xi Jinping as trade talks falter. Sources characterize the president as "obsessed" with securing this call [2], indicating the administration's prioritization of leader-to-leader diplomacy amid challenging formal negotiations. The headline suggests significant executive attention directed toward this bilateral relationship during a critical period.

[1] Analysis: An outline is emerging of the US offer to Iran in their high-stakes nuclear negotiations, https://apnews.com/article/iran-us-nuclear-talks-analysis-israel-mideast-2cbea2d6982bd8806d7e8fa7771afc37  

[2] 'The president is obsessed': Trump fixates on Xi call amid faltering trade talks, https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/03/trump-xi-call-trade-talks-00381858  

### 1.2 Political Positioning

Analytical reports are questioning whether Trump's political influence has reached its apex [1], suggesting potential shifts in the administration's leverage. The headline provides no specific metrics or triggering events for this assessment.

Simultaneously, polling data indicates President Trump's approval among Latino voters is "crashing" [2], potentially signaling demographic challenges for the administration. No specific figures or methodological details are provided about this apparent decline in support.

[1] Have we passed peak Trump?, https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/03/passed-peak-trump-second-term  

[2] Trump's approval among Latino voters is crashing, new poll shows, https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/03/somos-votanes-poll-trump-approval-latinos-00381855  

### 1.3 Budget and Fiscal Policy

President Trump's proposed budget contains a 15% reduction in Department of Education funding [1], signaling significant adjustments to federal education priorities. The headline offers no details about which specific programs would face cuts.

# Analysis of Summary Chunks

After examining the three summary chunks, I notice several key patterns:

1. **First Chunk Anomaly**: Summary 1 appears to be a placeholder reporting a failure in the information workflow rather than containing actual news content. This is likely an error in the data collection system.

2. **Substantive Content**: Summaries 2 and 3 contain legitimate news content with significant overlap in topics but different emphases:
   - Summary 2 focuses more on administration appointments, international relations, and congressional oversight
   - Summary 3 emphasizes the "Big Beautiful Bill" controversy, Musk's criticism after leaving DOGE, and trade/tariff developments

3. **Key Themes Across Chunks**:
   - Trump administration actions and policies
   - Elon Musk's departure from DOGE and subsequent criticism of administration
   - Republican party divisions over key legislation
   - International relations (particularly with China and Iran)
   - Economic policy (especially tariffs and trade)
   - Social policy challenges (LGBTQ+ rights, reproductive healthcare)
   - Immigration enforcement controversies
   - Technology regulation (particularly AI)

4. **Prioritization Needed**: I'll need to emphasize the most significant developments, particularly:
   - The unfolding "Big Beautiful Bill" controversy and Republican divisions
   - Musk's dramatic criticism after leaving DOGE
   - New tariff implementation and international reactions
   - Executive orders and major policy shifts

## Proposed Hierarchical Structure for Merged Summary

1. **Trump Administration and Executive Actions**
   - "Big Beautiful Bill" Controversy
   - Presidential Directives and Executive Orders
   - International Relations (Iran negotiations, China trade talks)
   - Budget and Fiscal Policies

2. **Elon Musk's Post-DOGE Relationship with Administration**
   - Criticism of "Big Beautiful Bill"
   - Congressional Oversight of DOGE
   - Ongoing Influence Through Associates

3. **Congressional Politics and Republican Party Divisions**
   - Intra-party Tensions Over Legislation
   - Democratic Opposition Strategies
   - Electoral Policy Initiatives

4. **Economic Policy and International Trade**
   - Tariff Implementation and International Backlash
   - Labor Market Developments
   - Tax Policy Debates

5. **Social Policy and Civil Rights**
   - LGBTQ+ Rights Challenges
   - Reproductive Healthcare Access
   - Public Space Management

6. **Immigration Enforcement**
   - ICE Operations and Controversies
   - International Migration Negotiations

7. **Technology Regulation**
   - AI Regulation Debates
   - Cryptocurrency Oversight

8. **Legal and Judicial Developments**
   - Federal Investigations
   - Court Rulings on Administration Policies

The merged summary will maintain a similar length to the individual chunks while prioritizing the most newsworthy developments.


====================
    Round 3
    User: 
====================

**Step 2**

Merging:

Please faithfully merge all summary chunks into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks. 

Length Requirement: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

You must make sure all the news facts are accurate, news titles are accurate, and the URLs are precise. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical, because they were individually determined by LLMs. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You can reference to the merged hierarchical categories in the last round, and you can refine the categories if you like.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.  Although the citations have already been carefully selected, some articles are still better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. In that case, please think carefully and pick up the most important contents within the constraint of the total word count and number of citations. **In each topic, the citations count from [1].**

Please first think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. Then, think intelligently, and write the entire summary.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Use readable and accessible language. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Length Requirement Repeated for Emphasis: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

Please directly produce daily_briefing.txt containing your new summary, without asking for my permission.

Length Control:

Now, it is the time to take a look at your document length again. Before you do anything else, count the words (without counting the URLs) and number of citations, and explicitly write those out. 

See if they fit to the desired range: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

If not, please refine your summary, according to my requirements in Step 2. Especially, you should not make the language technical or dry, after you shortened the text. The language should always be readable and accessible. If you find other mistakes, please directly correct them. 

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You should produce the new daily_briefing.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

I made the following revisions to bring the summary within the target length:

1. Streamlined the content in section 1.2 by combining some sentences about executive actions
2. Condensed section 5 by merging the labor market and LGBTQ+ rights subsections and reorganizing the health and public space management information
3. Combined the ICE operations and federal investigations subsections in section 6
4. Trimmed some descriptive language while maintaining all factual information
5. Removed a few redundant mentions (like the controversy between Trump and Rand Paul that appeared in multiple sections)

The final document is approximately 1,690 words (excluding URLs) with 45 citations, which fits within the target range of 1300-1700 words and 30-50 citations.

    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Step 4**

Finalizing:

Now, it is the time to finalize your summary.

It is still quite likely that you made some factual mistakes. Please do a very careful, independent review of your summary. **Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

After you check the facts, you should also carefully check the tone, format, style and length. Use readable and accessible language. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

If you find mistakes, please directly correct them. It is time to produce the final daily_briefing.md, in simple Markdown format, without asking for my permission. 

Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing.

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

--- 


Right before you start printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `daily_briefing.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made. Thank you very much for all your hard work!


====================
    Round 5
    Assistant: 
====================

I'll now conduct a thorough fact-check and finalize the document according to the specified formatting requirements.
