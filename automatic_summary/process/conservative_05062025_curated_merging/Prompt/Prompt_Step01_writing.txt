**Step 1**

Comparing:

Please critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks provided below. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You must use your limited length to summarize the most important news, while skipping the secondary.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.

Please carefully think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. **You will do the merging task in the next round with my detailed instructions. Please do not attempt to write down your summary at this step, because you haven't been given the full instructions yet!** It is always better to take some time to think clearly for such a difficult task, and make detailed plans for yourself, before taking any actions. You should use this opportunity to prepare yourself for your next round of work by writing down some notes for yourself.

### 1.1 Federal Funding & Grant Management

President Trump's administration has implemented a systematic purge of what they characterize as "woke grants" established during the Biden presidency [1]. This policy has triggered significant consequences in academia, with Columbia University forced to lay off approximately 180 staff members [2] and Harvard University losing federal research funding access [3]. The administration's scrutiny of federal spending has also exposed alleged corruption, with reports that a foreign aid official who opposed DOGE initiatives allegedly redirected funds to associates while receiving undisclosed payments [4].

### 2.2 Illegal Immigration Cases & Issues

A suspect linked to a planned terror attack targeting musician Lady Gaga has been identified as a previously deported undocumented immigrant [1].
