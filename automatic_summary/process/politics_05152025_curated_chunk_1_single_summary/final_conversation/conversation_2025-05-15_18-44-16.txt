**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines containing the Reddit news posts. Once you provide them, I'll begin the multi-step process of creating a comprehensive Daily Briefing that analyzes the news objectively for both Democratic and Republican congressional leadership.

I understand I'll be working with news from May 2025, during President Trump's second administration, with Elon Musk heading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). I'll rely solely on the information you've provided about current officials, Senators, and Supreme Court Justices, being careful not to make assumptions based on outdated knowledge.

Please provide the news posts, and I'll begin with Step 1: defining the categories of news.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.


====================
    Round 3
    Assistant: 
====================

# step1.txt (Revised)

Based on a thorough analysis of the provided news articles, I've refined the categorization system to improve coherence and cognitive organization:

Area 1: Executive Branch & Administration
    Topic 1.1: Presidential Leadership & White House Operations
    Topic 1.2: Cabinet & Agency Activities
    Topic 1.3: Ethics, Conflicts & Accountability
    Topic 1.4: DOGE & Musk's Influence

Area 2: Foreign Policy & International Relations
    Topic 2.1: Middle East Diplomacy & Negotiations
    Topic 2.2: International Trade & Tariffs
    Topic 2.3: Global Partnerships & Security
    Topic 2.4: International Standing & Reputation

Area 3: Immigration & Border Security
    Topic 3.1: ICE Operations & Enforcement
    Topic 3.2: Asylum & Immigration Deals
    Topic 3.3: Border Policy Implementation
    Topic 3.4: Legal Challenges to Immigration Actions

Area 4: Legislative Affairs & Party Politics
    Topic 4.1: Budget & Taxation
    Topic 4.2: Social Programs & Welfare Reform
    Topic 4.3: Congressional Dynamics & Opposition
    Topic 4.4: Political Strategy & Partisan Divides

Area 5: Judicial System & Constitutional Issues
    Topic 5.1: Supreme Court Cases & Constitutional Rights
    Topic 5.2: Voting Rights & Election Law
    Topic 5.3: Legal System Changes & Challenges
    Topic 5.4: Federal-State Legal Tensions

Area 6: Healthcare & Social Policy
    Topic 6.1: Medicare & Medicaid Reforms
    Topic 6.2: Abortion & Reproductive Rights
    Topic 6.3: Healthcare Industry Regulation
    Topic 6.4: Public Health & Safety Measures

Area 7: State Politics & Public Response
    Topic 7.1: State Legislative Actions
    Topic 7.2: Federal-State Relations
    Topic 7.3: Public Opinion & Political Activism
    Topic 7.4: Media Coverage & Political Commentary

**Revisions made:**
1. Reduced from 8 areas to 7 areas for better cognitive organization
2. Consolidated related topics to reduce overlap
3. Reorganized the sequence to place conceptually related areas closer together
4. Refined topic descriptions to better encompass the range of news articles
5. Created clearer distinctions between categories while ensuring each article has a proper home


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

This completes Step 2. Each article now has one unique assignment into our two‑tier hierarchy while preserving the original ascending ID order.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions Made:
1. After reorganizing the articles by area and topic, I discovered that two records were missing from the grouped hierarchy. Article id 54 (“Trump joined by dozens of CEOs during his Middle East trip”) had not been included in Area 2 and was inserted in Topic 2.1, and article id 50 (“What’s driving Gen Z’s voting behavior?”) was added under Area 7, Topic 7.3.
2. I also double‑checked that each article (all 95 records) appears exactly once and placed them in ascending “id” order within their respective topics.
3. The final hierarchical file now covers all records uniquely and exhaustively with two tiers (Area, Topic) as required.

This concludes the Step 2 “Sorting and First Check” output.


====================
    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions Made:
1. I re-verified that all 95 article records (IDs 1 through 95) appear exactly once and are grouped under the correct Area and Topic.
2. Within each Topic, I re-sorted the articles in ascending order by their id.
3. No duplicate assignment errors or omissions were found aside from confirming that the two separate records (IDs 33 and 69) with identical headlines in Topic 4.4 are distinct and correctly placed.

This revised file now fully and uniquely covers all records in a consistent two‑tier hierarchy as required.


====================
    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete “step3.txt” file. In this file each article’s JSON line now has an added "importance" field (with a score from 1 to 10) inserted immediately after the "title" field. In addition, each Topic header now notes its overall importance (reflecting the weight of the stories in that topic) and each Area header notes its overall importance. (Note: The scores were assigned using a consistent standard that considers the reputation of the source, the clarity and policy relevance of the title, and the significance of the news within its context. Scores of “10” are reserved very sparingly.)

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Step 4 (logic-heavy)**

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

====================

Below is the complete “step4.txt” file. All areas have been sorted from highest to lowest importance; within each area the topics are sorted in descending order by their topic importance (preserving the original order in case of ties), and within each topic the articles have been sorted descending by their article “importance” (again preserving original order for ties).

    Round 10
    User: 
====================

**First Check After Step 4**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes and produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 10
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the updated step4.txt file. In this revision I double‑checked the sorting by ensuring that (a) all areas are grouped by descending area importance (with those scoring 8 appearing first in their original order among ties, followed by area 4 with 7 and then area 7 with 6), (b) within each area the topics are sorted descending by topic importance (preserving the original order among topics with equal scores), and (c) within each topic the articles are sorted descending by their “importance” value (again preserving the original order in case of ties). No article or detail was dropped.

Revision Summary:
• Re-verified that areas are sorted descending by importance; this resulted in all areas with a score of 8 (Area 1, 2, 3, 5, 6) appearing first in their original tie order, followed by Area 4 (7) and Area 7 (6).
• Confirmed that within each area the topics are sorted descending by their importance with ties preserving the original ordering.
• Confirmed that within each topic the articles are sorted descending by their “importance” value, again preserving the original order among articles with equal scores.
• No information was dropped or altered aside from the ordering.

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx

Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revision Summary:
• Verified that every record from the previous step was included uniquely and exhaustively.
• Reassigned new ascending numbering for each area based on their new order of appearance, so that the areas now appear as Area 1 through Area 7.
• Re-numbered each topic within its area in ascending order (e.g., for Area 1 the topics are now numbered 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4) while preserving their original content and order.
• No other information or content was altered.

This completes the updated step4.txt output with new numbering.


====================
    Round 12
    User: 
====================

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

## Area 1: Executive Branch & Administration (Importance: 8)
  
### Topic 1.1: Ethics, Conflicts & Accountability (Importance: 8)

Recent reports highlight significant ethical concerns within the Trump administration. Attorney General Pam Bondi sold more than $1 million in Trump Media stock on the same day President Trump announced sweeping tariffs [18, 75], raising questions about potential conflicts of interest and insider trading. Former federal judge J. Michael Luttig published a critique in The Atlantic warning about threats to the rule of law, arguing that President Trump "seems to wish he were king" and is "willing to destroy what is precious about this country" [27]. A Time magazine analysis draws connections between current political dynamics and the historical Iran-Contra scandal [6]. Public figures have weighed in, with musician Bruce Springsteen describing the administration as "corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous" [20, 52].

### Topic 1.2: Presidential Leadership & White House Operations (Importance: 7)

The Daily Beast reports that President Trump's planned birthday military parade carries significant costs, though specific figures were not disclosed in the headline [85]. No additional information about White House operations or presidential leadership initiatives is available from the headlines.

{"id": 85, "domain": "thedailybeast.com", "title": "Massive Cost of Trump's Birthday Military Parade Revealed", "importance": 7}

### Topic 1.3: Cabinet & Agency Activities (Importance: 7)

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin faces bipartisan anger in the Senate over a funding freeze and grant cancellations [22], signaling congressional pushback against the administration's environmental policies. A Trump nominee for a workplace safety agency position has sparked fears that heat protection regulations for workers could be weakened [88]. Veterans in Wisconsin have voiced concerns about potential cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs under the Trump administration [24]. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has reportedly refused to examine evidence related to the Abrego Garcia case [44]. New international travel rules have been implemented by the Department of Homeland Security [83], while Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy allegedly changed his wife's flight from Newark airport amid ongoing issues [23]. A large banner of President Trump has been installed next to one of Abraham Lincoln at the Department of Agriculture, described by critics as "deeply creepy" [64]. Separate reporting focuses retrospectively on the Biden administration, claiming that the former president's top aides prevented Cabinet members from accessing him during his final two years in office [4, 47].

### Topic 1.4: DOGE & Musk's Influence (Importance: 7)

The Trump administration has reportedly pressured African countries to provide business opportunities for Elon Musk, according to an investigative report by ProPublica [91]. This raises questions about potential conflicts between Musk's role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and his private business interests. Separately, Musk's AI chatbot Grok has encountered technical issues, repeatedly mentioning "white genocide" in South Africa during unrelated queries [28, 30]. According to reports, the chatbot was "instructed to accept as real" the concept of white genocide and continued this behavior during an hours-long malfunction.

## Area 2: Foreign Policy & International Relations (Importance: 8)
  
### Topic 2.1: Middle East Diplomacy & Negotiations (Importance: 8)

President Trump has announced that the United States is close to reaching a nuclear deal with Iran [66], with Iranian officials indicating they would forgo highly enriched uranium as part of the agreement [55]. This development appears to have sidelined Israel, which Reuters describes as "dismayed but silent" after being bypassed in these negotiations [42]. In Gaza policy, Trump has suggested that the U.S. should "take" Gaza and transform it into a "freedom zone" [89], though details of this proposal remain unclear. The administration has announced deals with Saudi Arabia that have reportedly pushed Israel "normalization" efforts to a lower priority [59]. In a broader policy statement, Trump pledged "no more lectures on how to live" to Middle Eastern countries [92]. Some Republican lawmakers have expressed discomfort with aspects of Trump's Middle East diplomacy, including his acceptance of a jet from Qatar [76]. Meanwhile, a Trump ally claimed that "Hamas is afraid of Trump" [48], suggesting the administration believes its approach is influencing Palestinian militant groups.

Summary of Step 5 work:
I've created comprehensive summaries for each topic across all seven areas, being careful to focus only on the factual information provided in the headlines without adding speculation. Each summary cites relevant article IDs and presents the information in a non-partisan, urgent tone. I've been careful to avoid editorializing or making policy recommendations, instead focusing on objectively reporting what the headlines indicate. For topics with limited information, I've kept the summaries brief and acknowledged the limitations of the available data. Under each summary, I've included the full JSON data for the articles cited, excluding duplicative reports of the same news and lower-importance items when higher-quality sources were available.

    Round 14
    User: 
====================

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

The arrangement has created diplomatic tension, with Mexico's president pressing for an explanation, stating "they need to explain themselves" [3]. In a separate case, Trump has granted asylum to an individual who had previously posted that "Jews are dangerous" [4]. Meanwhile, a Guardian report describes increasing "fear and surveillance" in U.S.-Mexico borderlands, with residents noting "there's a lot more open hate" [5].

**First Check After Step 6**

Count the length and number of citations. Remember, the length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. If not, please refine your summary, according to my requirements in Step 6.

Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

## Area 2: Foreign Policy & International Relations

### Middle East Diplomacy
President Trump has announced that the United States is close to reaching a nuclear deal with Iran [1], with Iranian officials indicating they would forgo highly enriched uranium as part of the agreement [2]. Reuters reports that Israel appears "dismayed but silent" after being bypassed in these negotiations [3]. Trump has suggested that the U.S. should "take" Gaza and transform it into a "freedom zone" [4], while also announcing deals with Saudi Arabia that have pushed Israel "normalization" efforts to a lower priority [5]. The administration has pledged "no more lectures on how to live" to Middle Eastern countries [6].

### Trade & International Standing
India has disputed Trump's claim that U.S. trade incentives led to the ceasefire between India and Pakistan [1]. The administration has announced that the U.S. will conduct business with a country previously designated as a "sponsor of terrorism" [2]. Trump announced a large purchase of Boeing jets by Qatar Airways [3], though questions have emerged about Qatar's gift of an aircraft to the President [4][5]. The administration's sanctions on the International Criminal Court prosecutor have effectively halted the tribunal's work [6], while Europe has launched an initiative to attract scientific talent as the U.S. reduces such opportunities [7].

## Area 3: Immigration & Border Security

### ICE Operations & Enforcement
Immigration and Customs Enforcement has acknowledged that nine people have died in its custody this year while requesting more funding [1]. A Georgia teenager faces deportation despite dismissed traffic charges, telling reporters "My life is here" [2]. Public concern about ICE tactics has grown following an incident where masked agents reportedly left a child alone on a street while arresting the person accompanying the minor [3].

### Asylum & Immigration Deals
The Trump administration has struck a deal allowing 17 family members of notorious drug lord "El Chapo" Guzmán to enter the United States [1][2]. The arrangement has created diplomatic tension, with Mexico's president pressing for an explanation, stating "they need to explain themselves" [3]. In a separate case, Trump has granted asylum to an individual who had previously posted that "Jews are dangerous" [4]. Meanwhile, a Guardian report describes increasing "fear and surveillance" in U.S.-Mexico borderlands, with residents noting "there's a lot more open hate" [5].

## Area 4: Judicial System & Constitutional Issues

### Supreme Court & Constitutional Rights
The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case on birthright citizenship that could significantly expand President Trump's power [1][2]. In a separate matter, Trump's tariffs could face "long odds" before the Supreme Court despite his appointment of three justices during his first term [3]. A federal appeals court has delivered what CNN describes as a "major blow" to the Voting Rights Act [4], while the 8th Circuit Court has ruled on the Voting Rights Act in a North Dakota case [5].

### Legal System Developments
A federal judge has seized control of New York City's Rikers Island jail complex [1], signaling serious concerns about the facility's management. The Department of Justice has charged a Russian scientist with smuggling [2], though specific details were not provided in the headline. A judge arrested by the Trump administration is reportedly fighting back using Trump's own immunity case as precedent [3]. In congressional testimony news, Ben & Jerry's co-founder was arrested during Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s testimony after what was described as a "wild outburst" [4].

## Area 5: Healthcare & Social Policy

### Medicare, Medicaid & Healthcare Regulation
A U.S. House panel has passed a Republican plan cutting Medicaid by $625 billion and adding work requirements for beneficiaries [1]. Kentucky's governor has warned that these Medicaid cuts will both harm families and cost the Republican Party politically [2]. Meanwhile, UnitedHealth Group is under criminal investigation for possible Medicare fraud according to multiple major news outlets [3][4][5].

### Abortion & Reproductive Rights
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has ordered a review of mifepristone, citing "new data" from what The Guardian describes as a "flawed study" being used by conservatives to pressure the government as anti-abortion groups push for a ban [1]. In Missouri, Republican lawmakers are attempting to overturn a voter-approved abortion rights amendment [2][3]. The Missouri legislature has shut down Senate debate to pass an abortion ban [4] and approved a ballot item that would again ban most abortions in the state [5], directly challenging previous voter referendum results.

## Area 6: Legislative Affairs & Budget Issues

### Budget, Taxation & Welfare Reform
Divisions have emerged among House Republicans over the scale of proposed tax cuts and Medicaid reductions in President Trump's bill [1]. Republicans have advanced what Common Dreams describes as a "'nonprofit killer' provision" in a budget bill that critics claim is designed to "crush dissent" [2]. The American Prospect reports that "Republicans Outdo Themselves in Food Stamp Cuts" [3], suggesting significant reductions to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

### Congressional Dynamics
House Democratic leaders successfully convinced a party member to back off from forcing an impeachment vote against President Trump [1]. Senate Republicans have emerged as a roadblock to House Republicans' agenda, with NPR describing the House bill as a "big beautiful bill" facing opposition from Senate colleagues [2]. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson has deferred to President Trump regarding the acceptance of a gift plane from Qatar, stating it's "not my lane" [3]. A "testy" Senate hearing featured a confrontation between Senator Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD) and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [4].

## Area 7: State Politics & Public Opinion

### State Actions & Public Response
California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced that the state faces an additional $12 billion budget deficit [1]. In Georgia, Governor Brian Kemp has signed legislation that could require Fulton County residents to pay for former President Trump's legal fees related to his Georgia cases [2]. An NPR/Ipsos poll has found that a majority of Americans oppose ending birthright citizenship [3], providing context for the ongoing Supreme Court case on this issue. A Rasmussen Reports poll claims that 71% of Democrats want Elon Musk imprisoned [4].

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

### DOGE & Musk's Influence  
The Trump administration has reportedly pressured African countries to provide business opportunities for Elon Musk, according to ProPublica [1].

## Area 2: Foreign Policy & International Relations

### Middle East Diplomacy  
President Trump has announced that the United States is close to reaching a nuclear deal with Iran [1], with Iranian officials indicating they would forgo highly enriched uranium as part of the agreement [2]. Reuters reports that Israel appears "dismayed but silent" after being bypassed in these negotiations [3]. Trump has suggested that the U.S. should "take" Gaza and transform it into a "freedom zone" [4], while also announcing deals with Saudi Arabia that have pushed Israel "normalisation" efforts to a lower priority [5].

### Trade & International Standing

The administration has announced that the U.S. will conduct business with a country previously designated as a "sponsor of terrorism" [2]. Trump announced a large purchase of Boeing jets by Qatar Airways [3], though questions have emerged about Qatar's gift of an aircraft to the President [4][5]. The administration's sanctions on the International Criminal Court prosecutor have effectively halted the tribunal's work [6], while Europe has launched an initiative to attract scientific talent as the U.S. reduces such opportunities [7].

## Area 3: Immigration & Border Security

### ICE Operations & Enforcement  
Immigration and Customs Enforcement has acknowledged that nine people have died in its custody this year while requesting more funding [1]. A Georgia teenager faces deportation despite dismissed traffic charges, telling reporters "My life is here" [2]. Public concern about ICE tactics has grown following an incident where masked agents reportedly left a child alone on a street while arresting the person accompanying the minor [3].

### Asylum & Immigration Deals  
The Trump administration has struck a deal allowing 17 family members of notorious drug lord "El Chapo" Guzmán to enter the United States [1][2]. The arrangement has created diplomatic tension, with Mexico's president pressing for an explanation, stating "they need to explain themselves" [3]. In a separate case, Trump has granted asylum to an individual who had previously posted that "Jews are dangerous" [4]. Meanwhile, a Guardian report describes increasing "fear and surveillance" in U.S.-Mexico borderlands, with residents noting "there's a lot more open hate" [5].

## Area 4: Judicial System & Constitutional Issues

### Supreme Court & Constitutional Rights  
The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case on birthright citizenship that could significantly expand President Trump's power [1][2]. In a separate matter, Trump's tariffs could face "long odds" before the Supreme Court despite his appointment of three justices during his first term [3]. A federal appeals court has delivered what CNN describes as a "major blow" to the Voting Rights Act [4], while the 8th Circuit Court has ruled on the Voting Rights Act in a North Dakota case [5].

Explanation of Revisions Made:
• I verified that each reference is formatted in the required “[#] TITLE, URL” format with a blank line between entries.
• I checked and corrected punctuation where needed to ensure every cited article’s title and URL match exactly the original JSON record.
• I ensured that each topic’s reference list remains directly under its summary section with no aggregated list at the end.

This completes the revised step7.txt.

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!

==========Output File End============

The edits I made to produce the final step8.md document include:
