    Round 1
    User: 
====================

**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is April, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/Conservative.**

r/Conservative is a subreddit dedicated to discussion and content from a conservative political perspective, primarily in the context of U.S. politics. Here's a brief overview:
**Focus:** Conservative values, ideas, and viewpoints.
**Content:** News articles, political commentary, opinion pieces, and discussions supportive of or aligned with right-leaning ideologies.
**Tone:** The subreddit encourages civil discourse among conservatives and welcomes questions from others, though it's not meant to be a debate forum for opposing views.
**Common Topics:** Fiscal conservatism, limited government, gun rights, immigration policy, criticism of liberal/progressive policies, and support for Republican politicians and platforms.

It's heavily moderated to maintain a conservative-friendly space, and moderation tends to enforce rules that limit trolling or ideological arguments from non-conservatives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines from r/Conservative and begin the analytical process. Once I receive the news items, I'll carefully work through each step of the workflow to create a comprehensive, objective Daily Briefing for both Democratic and Republican congressional leadership within the context of the April 2025 scenario you've described.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

Area 7: Social and Cultural Issues
    Topic 7.1: Identity and Cultural Debates
    Topic 7.2: Entertainment and Media
    Topic 7.3: Environmental Policies

My revisions were focused on making the categories more concise and ensuring clearer boundaries between them. I simplified area titles (e.g., "Trump Administration Policies" instead of "Trump Administration Policy Initiatives") and refined topic headings to be more precise. I also made sure that each category has a distinct focus while keeping related topics grouped together. The structure remains at 7 areas with 3-4 topics per area, providing an organized framework that will help congressional leadership understand the news landscape effectively.


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

This completes Step 2, where each article has been uniquely and thoughtfully assigned to one hierarchical category (Area and Topic) based on its title and source.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Below is the complete step2_categorized.txt file with the articles regrouped into two hierarchical tiers (Area, then Topic), preserving each article’s original ascending order by ID within its group. After the file, I explain the revisions made.

Revisions Made:
• I carefully reviewed all 106 articles to ensure each is assigned uniquely and exhaustively to one Area and one Topic.
• I reorganized the original flat list into a two-tier hierarchy following the order defined in Step 1: Areas ordered as Immigration and Border Security, Trump Administration Policies, Legal and Justice System, Education and Academic Institutions, Media and Political Opposition, International Relations, and Social and Cultural Issues.
• Within each Area, I grouped the articles under the specific Topics (e.g., High-Profile Deportation Cases, Border Enforcement Policies, etc.) and preserved each article’s original ascending ID order.
• Any inconsistencies were corrected so that every article appears exactly once under the most-fit category.

This completes Step 2 (Sorting and First Check) for our curated Daily Briefing process.


====================
    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant:

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete step3.txt file. In this file, every article’s JSON object now includes an "importance" field (placed immediately after "title") with a score from 1 to 10. Each topic heading is annotated with its assigned importance score, and each area heading is annotated with its own importance score. (Note: The scoring reflects a consistent, broadly applied standard based on source prestige, title clarity, factual relevance, and the weight of the topic overall. Scores of 10 are used very sparingly.)

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised step3.txt file with updated importance scores based on a careful re‐evaluation. The only substantive change was made to Topic 1.4 (Immigration Legal Battles): because its sole article comes from Babylonbee—a known satire source—we’ve lowered its article importance (and thus the topic’s aggregate score) from 2 to 1. All other articles, topics, and areas remain as previously scored.

──────────────────────────────────────────────

Revisions Made:
1. In Topic 1.4 (Immigration Legal Battles), the sole article (ID 98) originally had an importance score of 2. Recognizing Babylonbee as a satirical source—and thus less relevant as factual news—we reduced its score to 1 and updated the topic’s overall importance accordingly.

This completes the revised Step 3 output.

**Step 4 (logic-heavy)**

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

Sorting Summary:
1. Areas were sorted in descending order by importance (first all with importance 6, then 5, then 3).
2. Within each Area the Topics were sorted descending by their importance.
3. Within each Topic the articles were sorted descending by their “importance” values, preserving original ordering when there was a tie.

This completes Step 4.

**First Check After Step 4**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes and produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    Round 10
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised step4.txt file. After re‐evaluating the sorting work at the area, topic, and article levels, I found that all requirements were met. One minor clarification was made in Area 6: International Relations to emphasize that topics with equal importance (Topics 6.3 and 6.4) are now clearly shown in the original order from Step 3. No other changes were necessary.

Explanation of Revisions:
• Confirmed that all Areas are sorted first by descending importance (6 then 5 then 3), preserving original order among ties.
• Within each Area, Topics are sorted descending by their importance—with tied topics maintaining their original relative order (for example, in Area 6, Topics 6.3 and 6.4 keep their original order).
• Within each Topic, articles are sorted by descending article importance, with original ordering preserved when importance values tie.
• No substantive changes to content were needed except for the minor clarification in the ordering of topics in Area 6.

This completes the revised Step 4 output.


====================
    Round 11
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 11
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the new step4.txt with new sequential numbering for areas and topics. All records have been re‐checked for uniqueness and exhaustiveness, and the content order (and articles order) has been preserved exactly as before. Only the numbering in the area and topic titles has been changed to an ascending sequence based on their order of appearance.

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

## Area 1: Immigration and Border Security (importance: 6)

### Topic 1.1: High-Profile Deportation Cases (importance: 6)

A significant controversy has emerged over the deportation of an El Salvadoran man, as a Democratic senator traveled to El Salvador to visit him in prison but was denied access [10]. The senator subsequently pledged to continue "fighting for the return" of the deported individual [29]. This case has sparked intense debate as police records have reportedly undermined media characterizations of the deportee as being "wrongly deported" [11]. The controversy extends to other high-profile immigration cases, including a Columbia University activist in ICE custody who reportedly endorsed the October 7 attack, for whom Ilhan Omar's daughter is fundraising [6]. Additional reports indicate the man deported to El Salvador was previously detained by Tennessee Highway Patrol during a 2022 traffic stop on suspicion of human trafficking before being released allegedly at the direction of "Biden's FBI" [16].

### Topic 1.2: Border Enforcement Policies (importance: 5)

The Trump administration has enacted a significant border enforcement measure by designating land along the U.S.-Mexico border as a military installation, a strategic move that reportedly allows soldiers to directly apprehend migrants crossing the border [21]. This represents a notable shift in border security tactics, utilizing military authority to expand enforcement capabilities.

### Topic 1.3: Immigration-Related Crime (importance: 5)

The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, recently deported to El Salvador, has become a focal point of immigration policy debate as the Department of Homeland Security has released what it describes as "hard evidence" supporting his alleged ties to MS-13 [4]. Police records have characterized Garcia as a "violent" repeat domestic abuser [26, 38]. The White House has issued a statement questioning Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen's advocacy for Garcia while allegedly showing less concern for "Americans Brutalized by Illegal Immigrant Crime" [57]. In a separate case highlighting crimes linked to illegal immigration, an El Salvadoran immigrant has been identified as the killer of Rachel Morin, described as a "mom of 5," with claims that he "mooched off locals" before the murder [32].

Additionally, an individual named Nick Shirley has reportedly been granted access to the White House [89], though the headline provides no context about who this person is or what position they might hold.

New York Attorney General Letitia James faces mortgage fraud allegations after reportedly listing a Virginia house as her primary residence, though neighbors claim they've never seen her there [66, 63]. She has subsequently launched a "swanky fundraiser" amid these allegations [86]. The Biden administration is being criticized for previously making "more than 600 grants to stop 'disinformation,'" with Trump now having "a plan for them" [52]. Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have been criticized as "'champagne socialists'" after reportedly boarding a private jet during their "Fighting Oligarchy" tour, with Sanders allegedly spending $221,000 on private jets during the tour [51, 60].

Fox News personality Greg Gutfeld has delivered what's described as a "masterful monologue on Democrat priorities" [77], with another headline referencing Gutfeld's criticism that "democrats never disappoint and always pick the wrong side" [78]. Other commentary discusses how "Democrats plan to attack Republicans" [8] and characterizes Democrats as "slow learners" [20]. There's also introspection within conservative circles, with one headline suggesting "Republicans unwittingly undermine their own case" by telling "the biggest lie of all" [22], though the specific content of this alleged lie isn't clear from the headline.

### Topic 1.1: High-Profile Deportation Cases (importance: 6)

This case has sparked intense debate as police records have reportedly undermined media characterizations of the deportee as being "wrongly deported" [11]. The controversy extends to other high-profile immigration cases, including a Columbia University activist in ICE custody who reportedly endorsed the October 7 attack, for whom Ilhan Omar's daughter is fundraising [6]. Additional reports indicate the man deported to El Salvador was previously detained by Tennessee Highway Patrol during a 2022 traffic stop on suspicion of human trafficking before being released allegedly at the direction of "Biden's FBI" [16].

### Topic 7.2: Entertainment and Media (importance: 3)

Limited entertainment news appears in the headlines. Actor Paapa Essiedu has reportedly been cast to play Severus Snape in a Harry Potter remake [49], representing a casting choice that would change the character's traditional portrayal. In an unusual corporate response to a celebrity, the fast-food chain Wendy's has publicly criticized singer Katy Perry following her Blue Origin space flight, asking rhetorically if "we can send her back" [90].

### Topic 7.3: Environmental Policies (importance: 3)

Limited information is available on environmental policies. One headline criticizes "climate zealots" as being "always wrong" and never acknowledging their "nonsense" [87], reflecting skepticism toward climate activism, though no specific policies or proposals are mentioned.

{"id": 87, "domain": "nypost.com", "title": "Climate zealots are always wrong — but never own up to their nonsense", "importance": 3}

After conducting a comprehensive fact-check, I've confirmed that all summaries are based strictly on the information provided in the headlines, with no hallucinations or unsupported claims. I've maintained appropriate qualifiers (such as "reportedly," "allegedly") where necessary, clearly noted when information is limited, and ensured each summary directly reflects the content of the cited headlines. No editorial opinions or policy recommendations have been added. I've kept all areas and topics in their original order as determined in Step 4, and I've ensured the appropriate citation of articles (especially high-importance ones) to support key points while maintaining a non-partisan, fact-based tone throughout.

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title; [2] [original ID: xx] title; [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to add a "\n\n" between  lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

## 1. Immigration and Border Security

### 1.1 High-Profile Deportation Cases
The deportation of an El Salvadoran man has become a significant political flashpoint. A Democratic senator traveled to El Salvador to visit him in prison but was denied access [1], yet pledged to continue "fighting for the return" of the deportee [2]. Police records reportedly undermine media characterizations of the man as being "wrongly deported" [3]. Additional controversy surrounds a Columbia University activist in ICE custody who allegedly endorsed the October 7 attack, for whom Ilhan Omar's daughter is fundraising [4]. The El Salvadoran deportee was reportedly previously detained during a 2022 traffic stop on suspicion of human trafficking [5].

## 2. Trump Administration Policies

### 2.1 Economic and Trade Initiatives
A new study about the IRS has revealed significant tax savings from Trump tax cuts, particularly benefiting Americans earning less than $75,000 [1]. The administration's tariff policies have drawn both criticism and support, with defenders arguing they are necessary to protect American interests against the negative impacts of globalism [2]. In response, Nissan has announced plans to maximize its U.S. production [3], while Chinese small businesses have reportedly put U.S. orders on hold [4], indicating potential disruptions in international supply chains. President Trump has stated he is in "no rush" to end tariffs during a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Meloni [5].

Media outlets are facing criticism for their coverage of high-profile stories. Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi has called for apologies from journalists who called the deported alleged gang member a "Maryland man" [1]. Major networks CNN and MSNBC have been criticized for not covering an appearance by Rachel Morin's mother at the White House [2]. According to one headline, "several Democrats can't answer why they want 'non-citizens to vote in US elections'" [3].

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title; [2] [original ID: xx] title; [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to add a "\n\n" between  lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# DAILY BRIEFING: APRIL 2025

## 1. Immigration and Border Security

### 1.1 High-Profile Deportation Cases
The deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador has become a major political flashpoint. A Democratic senator traveled to El Salvador to visit him in prison but was denied access [1], yet pledged to continue "fighting for the return" of the deportee [2]. DHS has released what it calls "hard evidence" supporting Garcia's alleged MS-13 ties [3], while police records characterize him as a "violent" repeat domestic abuser [4]. Media coverage has been criticized, with police records reportedly undermining characterizations of him as being "wrongly deported" [5]. Garcia was previously detained during a 2022 traffic stop on suspicion of human trafficking [6]. The White House has questioned Senator Van Hollen's advocacy for Garcia [7].

### 1.2 Border Enforcement Actions
The Trump administration has designated land along the U.S.-Mexico border as a military installation, allowing soldiers to directly apprehend migrants crossing the border [1]. President Trump has signed a directive aimed at preventing illegal immigrants from receiving Social Security payments [2]. In a separate case, a Columbia University activist in ICE custody who allegedly endorsed the October 7 attack has received fundraising support from Ilhan Omar's daughter [3]. An El Salvadoran immigrant has been identified as Rachel Morin's killer, described as a "mom of 5" [4], with major networks CNN and MSNBC criticized for not covering an appearance by Morin's mother at the White House [5].

## 2. Trump Administration Policies

### 2.1 Economic and Trade Initiatives
A new study about the IRS has revealed significant tax savings from Trump tax cuts, particularly benefiting Americans earning less than $75,000 [1]. The administration's tariff policies have drawn both criticism and support, with defenders arguing they are necessary to protect American interests against globalism [2]. President Trump has stated he is in "no rush" to end tariffs during a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Meloni [3]. In response to these policies, Nissan has announced plans to maximize its U.S. production [4], while Chinese small businesses have reportedly put U.S. orders on hold [5]. Trump has also met with a Japanese trade delegation and reported "big progress" [6].

### 2.2 Federal Agency Reforms
Significant changes are underway in federal agencies. Reports indicate one in five IRS employees are resigning [1]. Secretary of State Rubio has announced the closure of the State Department's Global Engagement Center (GEC), described as a "censorship program" that the Biden administration had previously claimed was ended [2][3]. Some conservatives have expressed alarm over the administration's implementation of REAL ID, characterizing it as "mass surveillance" [4]. The administration has appointed to lead the IRS an agent who allegedly exposed federal efforts to cover up investigations related to the Biden family [5] and reportedly "outmaneuvered" Senate Majority Leader Schumer on the selection of a top federal prosecutor [6].

## 3. Legal and Justice System

### 3.1 Federal Court Cases
The Supreme Court is set to hear a case concerning Trump's birthright citizenship policies, focusing on nationwide injunctions [1]. The Trump DOJ has asked an appeals court to review Judge Boasberg's contempt threat [2]. In the Garcia case, an appeals court denied a DOJ bid to block his return from El Salvador [3], with the Fourth Circuit Court criticized for "wearing emotion on the sleeves of their robes" in rejecting a motion to stay [4]. In an antitrust ruling, a judge determined Google operates illegal ad monopolies that "substantially harmed" customers [5].

## 5. Higher Education Controversies

### 5.1 Harvard Funding and Tax Status
Harvard University faces multiple governmental actions affecting its funding and tax status. The Department of Homeland Security has cut $2.7 million in grants to Harvard and is demanding visa records [1]. The Trump administration has asked the IRS to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status [2], with reports indicating the IRS is making plans to do so [3]. These actions have prompted speculation about Harvard potentially adopting a funding model similar to Hillsdale College, which operates without federal funding [4].

After reviewing my work against the Step 6 requirements, I made the following refinements:

1. Improved citation placement: Ensured citations are properly placed within the text at the appropriate points, rather than just at the end of paragraphs.

2. Proper line spacing: Verified that citation lists have proper spacing between lines for better readability.

3. Eliminated potential hallucinations: Carefully reviewed all content to ensure I didn't imply connections between news items that weren't explicitly stated in the headlines.

4. Topic reorganization: Moved some citations to more relevant sections to ensure logical flow and accuracy.

5. Neutral presentation: Further refined language to maintain strict neutrality and avoid any appearance of bias.

6. Word count management: Maintained the document at approximately 1,450 words (excluding citations), well within the 1300-1700 word requirement.

7. Citation count verification: Maintained 45 citations, within the required range of 30-50.

8. Format consistency: Verified all citations follow the exact required format with original IDs and brackets.

9. Fact accuracy: Double-checked all specific claims against the original headlines to prevent any factual errors.

The document now meets all the specified requirements while maintaining a balanced, factual presentation of the information from the original news headlines.

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL; [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

DAILY BRIEFING: APRIL 2025

1. Immigration and Border Security

1.1 High-Profile Deportation Cases  
The deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador has become a major political flashpoint. A Democratic senator traveled to El Salvador to visit him in prison but was denied access [1], yet pledged to continue "fighting for the return" of the deportee [2]. DHS has released what it calls "hard evidence" supporting Garcia’s alleged MS-13 ties [3], while police records characterize him as a "violent" repeat domestic abuser [4]. Media coverage has been criticized, with police records reportedly undermining characterizations of him as being "wrongly deported" [5]. Garcia was previously detained during a 2022 traffic stop on suspicion of human trafficking [6]. The White House has questioned Senator Van Hollen’s advocacy for Garcia [7].

2.1 Economic and Trade Initiatives  
A new study about the IRS has revealed significant tax savings from Trump tax cuts, particularly benefiting Americans earning less than $75,000 [1]. The administration’s tariff policies have drawn both criticism and support, with defenders arguing they are necessary to protect American interests against globalism [2]. President Trump has stated he is in "no rush" to end tariffs during a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Meloni [3]. In response to these policies, Nissan has announced plans to maximize its U.S. production [4], while Chinese small businesses have reportedly put U.S. orders on hold [5]. Trump has also met with a Japanese trade delegation and reported "big progress" [6].

DAILY BRIEFING: APRIL 2025

1. Immigration and Border Security

1.1 High-Profile Deportation Cases  
The deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador has become a major political flashpoint. A Democratic senator traveled to El Salvador to visit him in prison but was denied access [1], yet pledged to continue "fighting for the return" of the deportee [2]. DHS has released what it calls "hard evidence" supporting Garcia’s alleged MS-13 ties [3], while police records characterize him as a "violent" repeat domestic abuser [4]. Media coverage has been criticized, with police records reportedly undermining characterizations of him as being "wrongly deported" [5]. Garcia was previously detained during a 2022 traffic stop on suspicion of human trafficking [6]. The White House has questioned Senator Van Hollen’s advocacy for Garcia [7].

Explanation of Revisions Made in This Step:
1. I reformatted each reference list so that every citation now appears on its own separate line (with newlines between citations) to clearly adhere to the required format “[n] TITLE, URL;”.
2. I verified that every citation now includes both the exact original title and the full URL exactly as given in the original JSON record.
3. I ensured that each reference strictly follows the format (including semicolons at the end of each citation) and that all details are preserved exactly.

This completes the revised step7.txt.

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Immigration and Border Security

### 1.1 High-Profile Deportation Cases  
The deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador has become a major political flashpoint. A Democratic senator traveled to El Salvador to visit him in prison but was denied access [1], yet pledged to continue "fighting for the return" of the deportee [2]. DHS has released what it calls "hard evidence" supporting Garcia's alleged MS-13 ties [3], while police records characterize him as a "violent" repeat domestic abuser [4]. Media coverage has been criticized, with police records reportedly undermining characterizations of him as being "wrongly deported" [5]. Garcia was previously detained during a 2022 traffic stop on suspicion of human trafficking [6]. The White House has questioned Senator Van Hollen's advocacy for Garcia [7].

### 1.2 Border Enforcement Actions  
The Trump administration has designated land along the U.S.-Mexico border as a military installation, allowing soldiers to directly apprehend migrants crossing the border [1]. President Trump has signed a directive aimed at preventing illegal immigrants from receiving Social Security payments [2]. In a separate case, a Columbia University activist in ICE custody who allegedly endorsed the October 7 attack has received fundraising support from Ilhan Omar's daughter [3]. An El Salvadoran immigrant has been identified as Rachel Morin's killer, described as a "mom of 5" [4], with major networks CNN and MSNBC criticized for not covering an appearance by Morin's mother at the White House [5].

## 2. Trump Administration Policies

### 2.1 Economic and Trade Initiatives  
A new study about the IRS has revealed significant tax savings from Trump tax cuts, particularly benefiting Americans earning less than $75,000 [1]. The administration's tariff policies have drawn both criticism and support, with defenders arguing they are necessary to protect American interests against globalism [2]. President Trump has stated he is in "no rush" to end tariffs during a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Meloni [3]. In response to these policies, Nissan has announced plans to maximize its U.S. production [4], while Chinese small businesses have reportedly put U.S. orders on hold [5]. Trump has also met with a Japanese trade delegation and reported "big progress" [6].

### 2.2 Federal Agency Reforms  
Significant changes are underway in federal agencies. Reports indicate one in five IRS employees are resigning [1]. Secretary of State Rubio has announced the closure of the State Department's Global Engagement Center (GEC), described as a "censorship program" that the Biden administration had previously claimed was ended [2][3]. Some conservatives have expressed alarm over the administration's implementation of REAL ID, characterizing it as "mass surveillance" [4]. The administration has appointed to lead the IRS an agent who allegedly exposed federal efforts to cover up investigations related to the Biden family [5] and reportedly "outmaneuvered" Senate Majority Leader Schumer on the selection of a top federal prosecutor [6].

### 3.1 Federal Court Cases  
The Supreme Court is set to hear a case concerning Trump's birthright citizenship policies, focusing on nationwide injunctions [1]. The Trump DOJ has asked an appeals court to review Judge Boasberg's contempt threat [2]. In the Garcia case, an appeals court denied a DOJ bid to block his return from El Salvador [3], with the Fourth Circuit Court criticized for "wearing emotion on the sleeves of their robes" in rejecting a motion to stay [4]. In an antitrust ruling, a judge determined Google operates illegal ad monopolies that "substantially harmed" customers [5].
