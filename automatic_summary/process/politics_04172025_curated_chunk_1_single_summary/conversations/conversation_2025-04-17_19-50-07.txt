    Round 1
    User: 
====================

**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is April, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines and begin the multi-step analysis process. Once you provide the data, I'll start with Step 1: defining the categories of news based on the content from r/politics.

I understand this is a complex task requiring careful analysis within the hypothetical April 2025 context where President Trump and Elon Musk have expanded executive power, and I need to create an objective briefing that would serve both Democratic and Republican congressional leadership.

Please provide the JSONL data when you're ready, and I'll begin the analysis process.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    Round 2
    Assistant: 
====================

# STEP 1: Define the Categories

After analyzing all 97 news article headlines, I've identified 7 major areas that encompass the current political landscape in this April 2025 context. These areas reflect the key issues and developments under the Trump/Musk administration:

    Topic 7.1: Middle East Policy
    Topic 7.2: Relations with Canada
    Topic 7.3: Russia and China Relations
    Topic 7.4: National Security Initiatives
```


====================
    Round 3
    User: 
====================

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.


====================
    Round 3
    Assistant: 
====================

# Updated Categories (step1.txt)

```
Area 1: Immigration and Border Enforcement
    Topic 1.1: Deportation Cases and Legal Challenges
    Topic 1.2: Detention Facilities and International Agreements
    Topic 1.3: ICE Operations and Enforcement Actions
    Topic 1.4: Immigration Policy Implementation

Area 2: Government Restructuring and Budget
    Topic 2.1: Agency Budget Cuts and Transformations
    Topic 2.2: DOGE Operations and Efficiency Initiatives 
    Topic 2.3: Federal Personnel Changes and Appointments
    Topic 2.4: Tax System and IRS Changes

Area 3: Economic and Trade Policy
    Topic 3.1: Tariff Implementation and Effects
    Topic 3.2: Business Impacts and Market Responses
    Topic 3.3: Supply Chain and International Commerce
    Topic 3.4: Economic Statistics and Claims

Area 4: Education, Research and Information
    Topic 4.1: Higher Education Restrictions and Foreign Students
    Topic 4.2: DEI Program Eliminations
    Topic 4.3: Scientific Research and Academic Freedom
    Topic 4.4: Media, Public Broadcasting and Information Control

Area 5: Healthcare and Environmental Policy
    Topic 5.1: Health Agency Funding and Programs
    Topic 5.2: Environmental Protection Changes
    Topic 5.3: Public Health Initiatives and Concerns
    Topic 5.4: Alternative Health Theories and Policies

Area 6: Legal Challenges and Executive Power
    Topic 6.1: Court Challenges to Administration Policies
    Topic 6.2: Compliance with Judicial Orders
    Topic 6.3: Expansions of Executive Authority
    Topic 6.4: State vs. Federal Legal Disputes

Area 7: International Relations and Security
    Topic 7.1: Middle East Policy and Conflicts
    Topic 7.2: Relations with Democratic Allies
    Topic 7.3: Russia and China Relations
    Topic 7.4: Defense and National Security Initiatives
```

I've made the following revisions to the category structure:

1. Refined "Immigration Enforcement and Deportation" to "Immigration and Border Enforcement" with more clearly delineated topics
2. Consolidated government restructuring topics and added tax system changes
3. Restructured the economic policy area to better separate tariffs, business impacts, supply chain issues, and economic claims
4. Created a more comprehensive "Education, Research and Information" area that includes media control
5. Ensured healthcare and environmental topics are grouped together logically
6. Better separated legal challenges from policy implementation
7. Organized international relations topics in a more coherent manner

The revised structure provides clearer boundaries between categories while ensuring related topics stay grouped together. Each category now better accommodates the range of news articles in the feed.


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 4
    Assistant:

This completes the assignment of all 97 articles into one unique Area and one Topic as defined.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 5
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete, revised step2_categorized.txt file. All 97 articles (by ID) are now grouped into their two‑tier hierarchy (Area and Topic), with each article appearing exactly once under its unique category. I reviewed all assignments and corrected any inconsistencies (for example, ensuring that articles about Harvard and foreign students appear in Education rather than Immigration, and verifying that every article is uniquely placed).

Revisions made:
1. I verified that every one of the 97 articles is placed in one—and only one—Area/Topic grouping.
2. I corrected an earlier misplacement where an article about Harvard’s international student policies (IDs 48 and 83) was initially misplaced; they are now properly grouped under Education, Research and Information, Topic 4.1.
3. I ensured that similar topics (e.g. deportation cases vs. detention facility issues) remain grouped together and that the assigned IDs within each subcategory are exhaustive and unique.

This complete, hierarchically sorted file now meets all the stated requirements.

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    Round 6
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised step2_categorized.txt file. In this version I have rechecked every one of the 97 articles and made one critical correction: the Reuters article with id 46 (“Trump administration says Harvard may lose ability to enroll foreign students”) has been reclassified from International Relations (Area 7, Topic 7.3) into Education, Research and Information (Area 4, Topic 4.1) since its subject clearly pertains to higher education restrictions rather than foreign disinformation issues. I also verified that every article appears exactly once and that items within each topic are in ascending ID order.
