### 1.1 Presidential Communications and Rhetoric

President Trump has issued strong statements condemning Russian President Putin following a significant escalation in Russian attacks on Ukraine.

The President also posted contentious Memorial Day messages containing criticism of judges, whom he reportedly called "monsters," and other political opponents [4]. Other presidential communications included questions about the monetization of the presidency [5] and references to Harvard University [6], though specific details on these topics remain limited in the available headlines.
