**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

====================Input File End======================

---

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines containing the Reddit news posts. Once you provide them, I'll begin the systematic analysis following the 8-step workflow to create a comprehensive Daily Briefing for both Democratic and Republican leadership. I understand this is set in May 2025, and I'll rely solely on the information provided rather than my outdated internal knowledge.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

# step1.txt (Updated)

Based on careful review of the provided news headlines, I've organized them into a logical hierarchical structure with major areas and specific topics:

Area 1: Executive Branch Activities
    Topic 1.1: Presidential Communications and Rhetoric
    Topic 1.2: Administration Management and Appointments
    Topic 1.3: Executive Policy Implementation
    Topic 1.4: Presidential Events and Appearances

Area 2: International Relations and Trade
    Topic 2.1: Russia-Ukraine Conflict
    Topic 2.2: EU and Trade Negotiations
    Topic 2.3: Middle East and Iran Diplomacy
    Topic 2.4: Other International Engagements

Area 3: Congress and Legislation
    Topic 3.1: Proposed Bills and Legislative Actions
    Topic 3.2: Congressional Statements and Activities
    Topic 3.3: Budget and Spending Issues
    Topic 3.4: Partisan Dynamics

Area 4: Legal and Judicial System
    Topic 4.1: Federal Court Rulings
    Topic 4.2: Judicial Independence and Security
    Topic 4.3: Law Enforcement Actions
    Topic 4.4: Legal Challenges to Administration

Area 5: Domestic Policy Implementation
    Topic 5.1: Economic and Tax Policy
    Topic 5.2: Healthcare and Social Services
    Topic 5.3: Immigration and Border Security
    Topic 5.4: Environmental and Infrastructure Issues

Area 6: Social Issues and Civil Rights
    Topic 6.1: Racial Justice and Civil Rights
    Topic 6.2: LGBTQ+ Rights and Inclusion
    Topic 6.3: Veterans and Military Affairs
    Topic 6.4: Public Health and Safety

Area 7: Political Strategy and Future Elections
    Topic 7.1: Democratic Party Strategy
    Topic 7.2: Republican Party Positioning
    Topic 7.3: 2028 Election Considerations
    Topic 7.4: Public Opinion and Media

**Revisions Made:**
1. Renamed and refined several area titles to be more precise and reduce overlap
2. Reorganized topics to create clearer distinctions between categories
3. Made the flow more logical - from executive actions to international affairs, then to domestic legislation, legal matters, policy implementation, social issues, and future political considerations
4. Ensured each news article has a clearer best-fitting category by refining topic definitions


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Each article now appears exactly once with a unique placement under one of the seven defined areas and its corresponding topic.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions and Explanation:

• I rechecked every original assignment from step2.txt and ensured that each of the 68 articles is placed exactly once into one Area and then the appropriate Topic.
• I grouped the articles into seven Areas (Executive Branch Activities; International Relations and Trade; Congress and Legislation; Legal and Judicial System; Domestic Policy Implementation; Social Issues and Civil Rights; and Political Strategy and Future Elections) as defined previously.
• Within each Area the articles are sub-grouped by their designated Topics.
• Within each Topic, the JSON lines are ordered in ascending order according to their original IDs.
• I verified that the total count (68 articles) is fully and uniquely covered.

This completes the Sorting and First Check after Step 2.


====================
    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised step2_categorized.txt file. After a thorough independent review, I found that every article—from ID 1 to ID 68—was included exactly once under one Area and one Topic. I verified that the total count is 68 articles, with each article uniquely categorized. Only minor adjustments of formatting (and verifying proper ascending order within each topic) were needed, so the file remains essentially unchanged from the previous version.

Revisions and Explanation:

• A full second pass confirmed that all 68 articles (IDs 1–68) are uniquely and exhaustively included.
• The articles have been grouped into the seven Areas and their respective Topics, with the JSON lines maintained in ascending order within each Topic.
• No duplicate assignments or missing records were found, so only minimal formatting clarifications were needed.

This completes the second check after Step 2.

====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete contents of step3.txt. In this file we provide the three‐tier hierarchy (Area → Topic → Article), and we have inserted an “importance” field into each article’s JSON line (immediately following the "title" field) according to our scoring rubric. In addition, we annotate each Topic and Area with an overall importance score (from 1 to 10), based on both the weight and quality of the articles it contains.

Explanation of the Scoring Process:

1. For each article we evaluated the source’s reputation (e.g., AP, Reuters, BBC, Financial Times were rated high), the clarity and factual tone of the headline, and the intrinsic news impact. Scores typically ranged from 5–8 for most pieces, with a score of 4 for niche legislative proposals and 6–8 for articles addressing major policy or international events.
2. At the Topic level, we considered both the aggregate importance of its articles and the overall subject’s weight on national/international political developments.
3. At the Area level, we similarly aggregated the topics and weighed their overall importance considering how they might affect U.S. policy, governance, or political discourse.

This completes Step 3.


====================
    Round 8
    User: 
====================

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the updated step3.txt file after a careful re‐evaluation. In this revision, I adjusted some topic and area importance scores so that they better reflect the average impact of the articles within each topic and the collective weight of topics within each area. In short, I reduced Area 1 from an 8 to a 7 (with Topic 1.1 changing from 8 to 7), reduced Topic 2.2 from 8 to 7 and Area 2 from 8 to 7, lowered the overall importance of Area 3 from 7 to 6 (with Topic 3.2 shifting from 7 to 6), kept Area 4 unchanged at 7, revised Area 5 to 7 (with Topic 5.2 dropping from 7 to 6), reduced Area 6 from 7 to 6 (with Topic 6.1 adjusted to 6), and lowered Area 7 from 6 to 6 with Topic 7.4 adjusted to 6. The detailed file is provided below.

• In Topic 7.4, changed the score from 7 to 6, with Area 7 overall remaining at 6.
These revisions ensure better consistency with the average importance of individual articles and the overall weight of each topic and area.

This completes the updated Step 3.

**Step 4 (logic-heavy)**

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 9
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete contents of step4.txt with the entire document sorted by importance from high to low. The sorting was done in three layers: (1) Areas were sorted in descending order by their “importance” (with ties kept in original order), (2) within each Area the Topics were sorted in descending order by their “importance” (again preserving original order for ties), and (3) within each Topic the individual articles (JSON lines) were sorted in descending order by their “importance” (preserving the original order for any ties).

**First Check After Step 4**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes and produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 10
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the updated step4.txt file with revised sorting. In this revision I re‐examined every area, topic, and article and found that while the overall logic was correct, one minor adjustment was needed in the ordering of topics within Area 5. In the originally provided file the order of topics in Area 5 did not fully reflect the original ordering for ties, so I have now placed Topic 5.3 (Immigration and Border Security) before Topic 5.4 (Environmental and Infrastructure Issues) while moving Topic 5.2 (Healthcare and Social Services) to the end. All other sorted sections remain as previously produced.

Revision Summary:
• In Area 5 (Domestic Policy Implementation), the original topic order was adjusted. Instead of the previous sequence, I now order the topics as follows: Topic 5.1 (Economic and Tax Policy, importance 8) remains first, followed by Topic 5.3 (Immigration and Border Security, importance 7), then Topic 5.4 (Environmental and Infrastructure Issues, importance 7), and finally Topic 5.2 (Healthcare and Social Services, importance 6) at the end. This change fully respects the descending importance order while preserving the original order for topics with tied importance.
• All other areas, topics, and the articles within them remain as previously sorted with no further changes needed.

This completes the updated Step 4 output.


====================
    Round 11
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 11
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the newly renumbered step4.txt file. All areas and topics are now assigned new ascending numbers based on their order of appearance, while the ordering and content of the articles remain exactly the same.

Revision Summary:
• Re-numbered all Areas sequentially from 1 to 7 based on their order of appearance.
• Within each Area, all Topic designations were re-numbered in ascending order (e.g., Area 1 topics now read 1.1, 1.2; Area 2 topics now read 2.1, 2.2, etc.) while retaining the original ordering and content.
• Verified that every record from the previous document is covered uniquely and exhaustively.

This completes the revised step4.txt file with updated numbering.

    Round 12

====================

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

────────────────────────────────────────────
Area 1: Executive Branch Activities [importance: 7]

  Topic 1.1: Presidential Communications and Rhetoric [importance: 7]
  
President Trump has issued strong statements condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin following a significant escalation in Russian attacks on Ukraine. Multiple news outlets reported Trump calling Putin "absolutely crazy" and warning about the "downfall of Russia" if attacks continue (26, 51, 52, 14). In response, Russian sources characterized Trump's reaction as stemming from "emotional overload" or "emotional overstrain" (61, 55). The President also posted contentious Memorial Day messages containing criticism of judges, whom he reportedly called "monsters," and other political opponents (48, 65, 68). These communications mark a notably confrontational tone from the administration toward both foreign leaders and domestic institutions. Other presidential communications included questions about the monetization of the presidency (21) and references to Harvard University (66), though specific details on these topics remain limited in the available headlines.

  Topic 1.2: Presidential Events and Appearances [importance: 6]
  
President Trump delivered a commencement address at the United States Military Academy at West Point where he reportedly warned graduating cadets about "the perils of trophy wives" (28), though the context and full content of these remarks are not clear from the headline alone. Separately, reports indicate an upcoming "Trump Parade" that appears to be overshadowing traditional Memorial Day commemorations (47). With only these two headlines available, the complete nature and significance of these presidential appearances cannot be fully assessed.

────────────────────────────────────────────
Area 2: International Relations and Trade [importance: 7]

  Topic 2.1: Russia-Ukraine Conflict [importance: 8]
  
The Russia-Ukraine conflict has intensified with Russia launching what's described as its "third consecutive attack on Ukraine" (23). President Trump has strongly condemned Putin's actions, stating "I don't know what the hell happened to Putin" and indicating he's "absolutely" considering sanctions against Russia (23, 24). This represents a significant shift in tone, with Trump taking an unexpectedly confrontational stance toward Putin. Russian officials responded to Trump's criticisms by suggesting the President was experiencing "emotional overload" or "emotional overstrain" (50, 55). The exchange indicates escalating tensions between the U.S. and Russia over the Ukraine conflict, though the specific details of potential U.S. sanctions or other responses remain unclear from the available headlines.

  Topic 2.2: Middle East and Iran Diplomacy [importance: 8]
  
President Trump has indicated that a significant announcement regarding Iran nuclear talks is imminent, suggesting it will come in the "next two days" (32). The President framed a potential Iran deal as necessary to avoid "a lot of people dead" (49), suggesting urgent security concerns are driving the negotiations. These statements point to active diplomatic engagement with Iran, though the specific terms or nature of the potential agreement remain unclear from the available headlines. This development could mark a major shift in U.S.-Iran relations under the Trump administration.

  Topic 2.3: EU and Trade Negotiations [importance: 7]
  
President Trump has postponed the implementation of threatened 50% tariffs on the European Union until July 9, 2025 (19, 43, 3). The delay reportedly followed a "very nice call" with an EU chief (36), with one report characterizing the EU president as having "secured" the tariff delay (42). Some media outlets framed this decision more critically, suggesting Trump "chickened out" on the tariff threat (38). This development indicates ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and EU remain unresolved, but suggests diplomatic channels remain open for potential resolution before the new July deadline.

  Topic 2.4: Other International Engagements [importance: 6]
  
Southeast Asian nations are seeking to negotiate with the Trump administration on tariffs as a unified bloc, according to Malaysia's Prime Minister (33). This indicates regional coordination in response to U.S. trade policies. Meanwhile, businesses are reportedly finding legal methods to circumvent tariffs (57), suggesting economic adaptation to trade tensions. A separate headline draws comparisons between military operations in various countries, stating "that's the way militaries work in Russia and China and North Korea" (5), though the specific context of this comparison is unclear from the headline alone. These developments point to complex international dynamics around trade policy and military operations.

Area 3: Legal and Judicial System [importance: 7]

  Topic 3.1: Judicial Independence and Security [importance: 8]
  
U.S. federal judges are considering the establishment of their own armed security force as threats against them reportedly increase (16).

A separate report raises concerns about protecting judges from what it characterizes as "Trump's incitement" (56). These headlines suggest significant tensions between the judiciary and executive branch, with judges expressing concerns about their physical security and independence. The creation of an independent security apparatus would represent a major structural change in judicial protection protocols.

Republican senators have publicly rebuked what they described as an "immoral" Trump-backed bill, with one quoted as saying "Emperor has no clothes" (46). This headline suggests significant intra-party tensions within the Republican party over certain legislation, potentially the same "big, beautiful bill" mentioned in other reports. The use of stark language like "immoral" and the emperor metaphor indicates unusually strong opposition from members of the President's own party, though the specific bill and the nature of the objections are not detailed in this single headline.

Summary of process:
For each topic, I carefully analyzed the headlines and created concise, fact-based summaries that:
1. Focus on clearly presented facts from the headlines
2. Cite article IDs for major claims
3. Avoid speculation, policy recommendations, or editorializing
4. Acknowledge limitations where information is insufficient
5. Maintain a non-partisan tone throughout
6. Use appropriate length based on topic importance and complexity
7. Include all relevant JSON lines after each summary

The summaries prioritize the most important articles (those with higher importance scores) while still covering the breadth of information available across all headlines. Where headlines present limited or unclear information, I've explicitly noted these limitations rather than speculating.

Area 1: Executive Branch Activities [importance: 7]

  Topic 1.1: Presidential Communications and Rhetoric [importance: 7]
  
President Trump has issued strong statements condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin following a significant escalation in Russian attacks on Ukraine. Multiple news outlets reported Trump calling Putin "absolutely crazy" and warning about the "downfall of Russia" if attacks continue (26, 51, 52, 14). In response, Russian sources characterized Trump's reaction as stemming from "emotional overload" or "emotional overstrain" (61, 55). The President also posted contentious Memorial Day messages containing criticism of judges, whom he reportedly called "monsters," and other political opponents (48, 65, 68). These communications mark a notably confrontational tone from the administration toward both foreign leaders and domestic institutions. Other presidential communications included questions about the monetization of the presidency (21) and references to Harvard University (66), though specific details on these topics remain limited in the available headlines.

  Topic 2.1: Russia-Ukraine Conflict [importance: 8]
  
The Russia-Ukraine conflict has intensified with Russia launching what's described as its "third consecutive attack on Ukraine" (23). President Trump has strongly condemned Putin's actions, stating "I don't know what the hell happened to Putin" and indicating he's "absolutely" considering sanctions against Russia (23, 24). This represents a significant shift in tone, with Trump taking an unexpectedly confrontational stance toward Putin. Russian officials responded to Trump's criticisms by suggesting the President was experiencing "emotional overload" or "emotional overstrain" (50, 55). The exchange indicates escalating tensions between the U.S. and Russia over the Ukraine conflict, though the specific details of potential U.S. sanctions or other responses remain unclear from the available headlines.

The delay reportedly followed a "very nice call" with an EU chief (36), with one report characterizing the EU president as having "secured" the tariff delay (42). Some media outlets framed this decision more critically, suggesting Trump "chickened out" on the tariff threat (38). This development indicates ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and EU remain unresolved, but suggests diplomatic channels remain open for potential resolution before the new July deadline.

Southeast Asian nations are seeking to negotiate with the Trump administration on tariffs as a unified bloc, according to Malaysia's Prime Minister (33). This indicates regional coordination in response to U.S. trade policies. Meanwhile, businesses are reportedly finding legal methods to circumvent tariffs (57), suggesting economic adaptation to trade tensions. A separate headline draws comparisons between military operations in various countries, stating "that's the way militaries work in Russia and China and North Korea" (5), though the specific context of this comparison is unclear from the headline alone.

U.S. federal judges are considering the establishment of their own armed security force as threats against them reportedly increase (16). According to reports, the proposal would move security under judges' direct control, with one article noting that the Department of Justice "has vowed loyalty to Trump" (16). A separate report raises concerns about protecting judges from what it characterizes as "Trump's incitement" (56). These headlines suggest significant tensions between the judiciary and executive branch, with judges expressing concerns about their physical security and independence. The creation of an independent security apparatus would represent a major structural change in judicial protection protocols.

Revisions made:

1. Topic 1.2: Removed specific reference to "United States Military Academy" at West Point, as the headline only mentions "West Point Commencement Speech" without specifying it was at the military academy.

2. Topic 2.3: Removed "2025" after July 9, as the headlines do not specify the year for the tariff delay.

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Senator Rand Paul has criticized what's being called a "big, beautiful bill," describing the cuts in the legislation as "wimpy," "anemic," and warning that they would "explode the debt" [1]. Additionally, Republican senators have publicly rebuked what they described as an "immoral" Trump-backed bill, with one quoted as saying "Emperor has no clothes" [2].

House Speaker Mike Johnson was questioned about "Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill'" [3] and claimed the bill "will only cut Medicaid for undeserving people" who "were never supposed to have had Medicaid" [3].

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

DAILY BRIEFING: May 2025

1. EXECUTIVE BRANCH ACTIVITIES

1.1 Presidential Communications and Rhetoric

President Trump has issued strong statements condemning Russian President Putin following a significant escalation in Russian attacks on Ukraine. Multiple news outlets reported Trump calling Putin "absolutely crazy" [1] and warning about the "downfall of Russia" if attacks continue [2]. In response, Russian sources characterized Trump's reaction as stemming from "emotional overload" or "emotional overstrain" [3].

Revisions Made:
1. Ensured every citation entry now strictly follows the format “[number] TITLE, URL” with a double newline between each entry.
2. Verified that each title and URL exactly match the original full JSON record.
3. Adjusted formatting for consistency and clarity throughout the document.

This completes the updated step7.txt.


====================
    Round 19
    User: 
====================

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Branch Activities

### 1.1 Presidential Communications and Rhetoric

President Trump has issued strong statements condemning Russian President Putin following a significant escalation in Russian attacks on Ukraine. Multiple news outlets reported Trump calling Putin "absolutely crazy" [1] and warning about the "downfall of Russia" if attacks continue [2]. In response, Russian sources characterized Trump's reaction as stemming from "emotional overload" or "emotional overstrain" [3].

The President also posted contentious Memorial Day messages containing criticism of judges, whom he reportedly called "monsters," and other political opponents [4]. Other presidential communications included questions about the monetization of the presidency [5] and references to Harvard University [6], though specific details on these topics remain limited in the available headlines.

### 2.3 EU and Trade Negotiations

President Trump has postponed the implementation of threatened 50% tariffs on the European Union until July 9 [1][2]. The delay reportedly followed a "very nice call" with an EU chief [3], with one report characterizing the EU president as having "secured" the tariff delay. Some media outlets framed this decision more critically, suggesting Trump "chickened out" on the tariff threat [4].

Meanwhile, Southeast Asian nations are seeking to negotiate with the Trump administration on tariffs as a unified bloc, according to Malaysia's Prime Minister [5]. Businesses are reportedly finding legal methods to circumvent tariffs [6], suggesting economic adaptation to trade tensions.

## 3. Legal and Judicial System

### 3.1 Judicial Independence and Security

U.S. federal judges are considering the establishment of their own armed security force as threats against them reportedly increase [1]. According to reports, the proposal would move security under judges' direct control, with one article noting that the Department of Justice "has vowed loyalty to Trump" [1]. A separate report raises concerns about protecting judges from what it characterizes as "Trump's incitement" [2].

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has reportedly begun arresting migrants at courthouses, a practice that "opens door to fast-track deportations" according to reports [2]. In a separate incident, a U.S. police officer resigned after "wrongfully arresting undocumented teen" [3].
