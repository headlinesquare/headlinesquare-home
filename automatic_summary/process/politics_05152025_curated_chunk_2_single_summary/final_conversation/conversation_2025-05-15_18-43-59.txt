**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I understand the task completely. I'll be analyzing news from r/politics in a May 2025 scenario where Trump is President and Musk leads DOGE, following your structured workflow across multiple steps.

I recognize that my internal knowledge is outdated, and I'll rely solely on the information you've provided about current political figures and the news headlines in the JSON lines to create an objective briefing for both Democratic and Republican congressional leadership.

I'll follow the 8-step process you outlined, with checks after each step, building the briefing methodically. I'll maintain factual accuracy without speculation, quoting unclear headlines directly, and being cautious about political titles/positions.

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines in your next prompt.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# Step 1: Category Definition

After analyzing the news headlines, I've identified major thematic areas and specific topics for categorization. Here is my proposed hierarchical structure:

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

    Round 3
    Assistant: 
====================

# Step 1: Category Definition (Revised)

After careful analysis of the news headlines, I've identified major thematic areas and specific topics for categorization. Here is my revised hierarchical structure:

Area 1: Executive Branch & White House
    Topic 1.1: Presidential Travel & Foreign Engagements
    Topic 1.2: Executive Orders & Administrative Actions
    Topic 1.3: Cabinet & Administration Personnel
    Topic 1.4: DOGE Operations & Efficiency Initiatives

Area 2: Economic Policy & Business
    Topic 2.1: Tariffs & International Trade
    Topic 2.2: Corporate Relations & Industry Directives
    Topic 2.3: Tax Legislation & Fiscal Measures
    Topic 2.4: Economic Indicators & Cost of Living

Area 3: Legislative & Congressional Activities
    Topic 3.1: Federal Budget & Spending Bills
    Topic 3.2: Government Agency Reform Legislation
    Topic 3.3: Social Services & Welfare Proposals
    Topic 3.4: Other Congressional Initiatives

Area 4: Immigration & Border Policy
    Topic 4.1: Birthright Citizenship Legal Challenges
    Topic 4.2: Immigration Enforcement & Deportations
    Topic 4.3: Visa Policies & Green Card Regulations
    Topic 4.4: Refugee, Asylum & Migration Issues

Area 5: Foreign Policy & National Security
    Topic 5.1: Middle East Relations & Diplomacy
    Topic 5.2: Russia-Ukraine Conflict
    Topic 5.3: China Relations & Trade Tensions
    Topic 5.4: International Agreements & Security Alliances

Area 6: Legal System & Judiciary
    Topic 6.1: Supreme Court Cases & Constitutional Issues
    Topic 6.2: Law Enforcement & Criminal Justice
    Topic 6.3: Civil Rights & Legal Protections
    Topic 6.4: State & Federal Legal Conflicts

Area 7: Domestic & Social Policy
    Topic 7.1: Healthcare & Public Health Initiatives
    Topic 7.2: Education & School Regulations
    Topic 7.3: Environmental & Land Use Policies
    Topic 7.4: State & Local Political Developments

**Revisions Explained:**
1. Reduced from 8 to 7 areas to improve cognitive efficiency
2. Combined and reorganized categories to ensure related topics are grouped together
3. Renamed several areas for clarity and precision
4. Made "Political Opposition & Public Response" elements distributable within relevant policy areas instead of separate
5. Created more specific topic descriptions to better accommodate all news headlines
6. Ensured each article can find a natural home in the category system


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Below is the complete step2.txt listing. Each line shows its unique assignment as [Area #: … / Topic #.#: …] followed by the original JSON line. The articles remain in ascending order by their IDs.

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 5
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete revised “step2_categorized.txt” file. In this file the 95 articles are grouped first by Area (with the seven defined areas) and then by Topic (with the four topics per area). Under each topic the articles appear in ascending order by their original IDs. (Note that for some areas a Topic had no articles, so it is omitted.) After the file, you’ll find a brief explanation of the revisions made.

Revisions Made:
1. I reorganized the flat list from Step 2 into a clear hierarchical structure by Area and then by Topic.  
2. During the review I discovered that Article id 176 had been omitted from Area 1, Topic 1.2; it is now correctly included, bringing the total to 95 unique records.
3. I ensured that every article appears once and only once, grouped under its unique area and topic, while preserving the original ascending order by ID within each topic.

This completes the fully revised step2_categorized.txt file.


====================
    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the updated version of step2_categorized.txt after an independent re‐check. In this version every one of the 95 articles appears exactly once in one (and only one) topic under its designated Area. The major revision made was to move the article with id 139 – originally assigned under Economic Policy & Business (Tax Legislation & Fiscal Measures) – into Immigration & Border Policy under Topic 4.3 (Visa Policies & Green Card Regulations), as its content clearly relates to green card regulations rather than tax policy.

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

====================

Below is the complete final “step3.txt” file. In this file, every article’s JSON object now has an added key "importance" (inserted immediately after the "title" field) with a score from 1 to 10. In addition, each Topic header is annotated with a “(Topic Importance: X)” note and each Area header with “(Area Importance: X)”. (All scores were determined by evaluating the source prestige, title clarity, relevance, and the overall weight of the news in its topic and area. The scores have been applied in a consistent manner across all items.)

Revisions and scoring rationale:
1. Each article has been reviewed for source reliability, title clarity, relevance, and overall impact to assign an importance score between 1 and 10.
2. Topic scores were determined by the collective importance of the articles it contains as well as the broader policy impact of that topic.
3. Area scores reflect the aggregate influence of the topics contained therein.
4. Care was taken to use the top score (10) very sparingly and to provide a consistent scale across articles, topics, and areas.

This completes the step3.txt file with all scoring added.

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the updated final version of step3.txt. In this new file I kept nearly all scores unchanged but made two minor adjustments based on a careful re‐evaluation:

• In Topic 1.4 (“DOGE Operations & Efficiency Initiatives”), the article from NBC News (id 188) has been raised from an importance of 7 to 8. Although the previous score was reasonable, the report’s subject—the new DOGE department’s oversight over federal fraud—is especially noteworthy in today’s unfolding events.

• In Topic 7.4 (“State & Local Political Developments”), the article from Common Dreams (id 158) has been increased from an importance of 4 to 5 to better reflect its strong language and potential to shape public sentiment amid a turbulent political moment.

All other scores remain unchanged. The new file is provided below.

**Step 4 (logic-heavy)**

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

Below is the complete final “step4.txt” file. In this file we have re‐ordered the entire document in three layers. First, the Areas are sorted in descending order by their Area importance. Next, within each Area the Topics are sorted in descending order by Topic importance (using the original order as a tie-breaker). Finally, within each Topic the articles are sorted in descending order by their “importance” field (again using their original order when scores tie).

    Round 10
    User: 
====================

**First Check After Step 4**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes and produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 10
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised final “step4.txt” file. In this update I made a few minor tweaks to ensure complete adherence to the instructions. In particular, I rechecked the ordering for topics and articles in a couple of areas (for example, within Topic 2.3 and Topic 7.4) to confirm that ties are broken strictly by preserving the original order as given in the Step 3 file. No information was dropped and every area, topic, and article is now sorted solely by descending importance with original order preserved in the event of ties.

Revisions Summary:
1. Re-evaluated the sorting within Topic 2.3 and Topic 7.4 to ensure that articles with equal importance preserve their original order.
2. Confirmed that all areas and topics are now re-ordered strictly by descending importance, with ties broken by original sequencing.
3. Verified that no information was dropped and that each layer (areas, topics, articles) adheres exactly to the descending importance order per the task instructions.

This completes the revised Step 4 output.


====================
    Round 11

====================

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Area 1: Executive Branch & White House (Area Importance: 8)
  Topic 1.1: Executive Orders & Administrative Actions (Topic Importance: 8)
  
The Trump administration is organizing a large-scale military parade coinciding with the President's birthday, featuring 25 Abrams tanks (190, 176). This event has drawn attention for its significant costs, though specific figures aren't provided in the headlines. In business directives, President Trump has ordered Apple not to expand iPhone production in India, with multiple reports citing tensions between Trump and Apple CEO Tim Cook, including quotes where Trump stated "I had a little problem with Tim Cook" and reportedly told him "I treated you very good" (117, 182). Other executive actions include an order for troops to applaud a podcast host who supported Trump's campaign (154), which raises questions about military protocols. Media commentary includes criticism regarding what appears to be a $400 million jet gift to Trump (101), though details about this gift are limited in the available headlines.

  Topic 1.2: Cabinet & Administration Personnel (Topic Importance: 7)
  
Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has dismissed top officials from the National Intelligence Council following a report related to Venezuela (175). The headlines don't provide specific details about the content of the Venezuela intelligence report or the exact reasons for the dismissals, but suggest significant internal changes in intelligence leadership under Gabbard's direction.

  Topic 1.3: DOGE Operations & Efficiency Initiatives (Topic Importance: 7)
  
According to a report by an anti-fraud firm cited by NBC News, international criminal organizations are allegedly siphoning approximately one trillion dollars annually from U.S. government programs, yet the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) appears to be taking minimal action to address this issue (188). The headline suggests a significant disparity between DOGE's stated efficiency mission and its response to this massive fraud problem, raising questions about the department's priorities.

  Topic 1.4: Presidential Travel & Foreign Engagements (Topic Importance: 6)
  
President Trump's recent Middle East tour appears to have included more substantive diplomatic content than initially disclosed by the White House (103). Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are scheduled to attend Pope Leo XIV's inauguration at the Vatican (111, 125). The headlines suggest Vance may have previously visited the Vatican, as one headline mentions his "return" to the Vatican for the Pope's inaugural mass. President Trump's foreign travels have drawn criticism from Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, who characterized one of Trump's trips as a "public corruption tour" (140), though the specific trip in question and the basis for this characterization aren't specified in the headlines.

Area 2: Economic Policy & Business (Area Importance: 8)
  Topic 2.1: Corporate Relations & Industry Directives (Topic Importance: 8)
  
The Trump administration has reportedly pressured African nations to advance business opportunities for Elon Musk, according to ProPublica (114). While Musk leads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the headline doesn't specify whether these business opportunities relate to his official government role or his private business interests. Separately, the administration is reportedly planning to significantly reduce banking regulations that were implemented following the 2008 financial crisis to prevent similar economic downturns (116). The headline suggests a major shift in financial regulatory policy that could have implications for economic stability.

  Topic 2.2: Tax Legislation & Fiscal Measures (Topic Importance: 8)
  
A Republican tax bill currently under consideration is reportedly obscuring its potential impact on the national debt, with analysis suggesting it could increase U.S. debt by more than $1 trillion (109, 142). The legislation contains controversial provisions, including one that could apply a "terrorism" designation to non-profit organizations that oppose Trump (138), and another proposing taxes on money transfers (remittances) that migrants and visa holders send to their home countries (178). The bill faces potential internal resistance from New York Republican representatives concerned about provisions affecting property owner tax write-offs (123). These diverse provisions suggest a contentious legislative process with significant fiscal and political implications.

  Topic 2.3: Economic Indicators & Cost of Living (Topic Importance: 8)
  
Economic indicators present a mixed picture of the U.S. economy. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon continues to warn that a recession remains possible for the United States, even after a reduction in China tariffs (134, 155). A concerning analysis reported by CBS News indicates that most Americans earn insufficient wages to cover basic living expenses (149). On a potentially positive note, U.S. wholesale prices decreased by 0.5% in the previous month despite the implementation of tariffs by the Trump administration (169). However, as CNN notes, falling prices might be attributed to concerning economic factors rather than positive developments (183). These headlines collectively suggest economic uncertainty despite some apparently positive indicators.

  Topic 2.4: Tariffs & International Trade (Topic Importance: 7)
  
Walmart, America's largest retailer, has announced plans to increase consumer prices in response to tariff costs (126, 96, 115, 133). These price increases are expected to take effect within weeks (112), potentially impacting millions of American consumers. Despite reporting strong first-quarter sales, Walmart maintains that price increases are necessary to offset tariff-related costs (133). Meanwhile, Fox News reports a significant development in U.S.-China trade negotiations that extends beyond tariff reductions (153), though specific details of this "breakthrough" aren't provided in the headline. These developments suggest that the administration's trade policies are having direct effects on consumer prices while diplomatic progress may be occurring with China.

Area 3: Immigration & Border Policy (Area Importance: 8)
  Topic 3.1: Birthright Citizenship Legal Challenges (Topic Importance: 9)
  
The U.S. Supreme Court is hearing arguments in a landmark case regarding President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship (137, 152, 160, 172). This legal challenge represents the culmination of what NPR describes as a "once-fringe theory on birthright citizenship" now reaching the nation's highest court (100). During oral arguments, justices appeared to question aspects of Trump's order (177). The case also involves consideration of whether lower courts should be permitted to issue nationwide injunctions against such executive actions (99). The numerous high-importance headlines from diverse media sources underscore the constitutional significance of this case, which could potentially redefine citizenship rights in the United States.

  Topic 3.2: Immigration Enforcement & Deportations (Topic Importance: 7)
  
Immigration enforcement actions continue to generate political and social controversy. Colorado has joined a 19-state coalition challenging federal funding decisions related to "sanctuary city" policies (141), suggesting significant intergovernmental tension over immigration enforcement. Several incidents highlight ongoing immigration enforcement activities, including the reported forcible removal of a drummer from the band Lord Buffalo from a flight by immigration authorities (166) and workers at Kid Rock's restaurant being advised to stay home to avoid rumored Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids (174). In New Jersey, a Democratic representative has criticized ICE and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) regarding conditions at a Newark facility (180). These headlines reflect continuing tensions surrounding immigration enforcement policies and practices.

  Topic 3.3: Visa Policies & Green Card Regulations (Topic Importance: 7)
  
The administration is implementing stringent scrutiny of technology sector visa applications, according to Wired (184), potentially affecting the tech industry's ability to recruit international talent. Additionally, Newsweek reports that a White House proposal would grant authorities the power to revoke green cards (permanent residency) "at any time" (139), representing a significant shift in immigration policy that could impact the security and stability of legal permanent residents in the United States. While details are limited in the headlines, both developments suggest a tightening of immigration pathways and reduced security for immigrants who have followed legal channels.

  Topic 3.4: Refugee, Asylum & Migration Issues (Topic Importance: 7)
  
The Trump administration's refugee policies regarding South Africans have sparked controversy. Democracy Now reports that the U.S. is welcoming white South Africans as refugees based on what they characterize as false claims by President Trump about "genocide" in South Africa (145). This policy decision has prompted analysis from historians, including one who grew up under apartheid, questioning whether white South Africans genuinely qualify as refugees (185). These headlines suggest a debate over the factual basis and potential racial implications of new refugee acceptance criteria.

  Topic 4.1: Middle East Relations & Diplomacy (Topic Importance: 9)
  
The United States and Iran are nearing a nuclear agreement, according to statements from President Trump reported by the BBC (98). This development suggests a potential diplomatic breakthrough with significant implications for regional security and international nuclear non-proliferation efforts. Separately, President Trump is rapidly pursuing artificial intelligence agreements with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, creating tensions with administration officials concerned about China's influence (146). These "China hawks" appear to oppose aspects of these Middle East AI deals, though specific points of contention aren't detailed in the headline. These developments indicate an active, multi-faceted Middle East policy that includes both traditional security issues like nuclear agreements and emerging technology partnerships.

President Trump has indicated that progress in resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict is contingent on his direct meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating that "nothing" will happen regarding Ukraine until this meeting occurs (107, 165). Both Trump and Putin have opted not to attend peace talks in Turkey, effectively sidelining Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy from these diplomatic efforts (119). These headlines suggest a significant shift in U.S. approach to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, with Trump prioritizing direct engagement with Putin over multilateral negotiations that include Ukraine's leadership.

Rolling Stone reports that Trump promised protection to Qatar in the context of Qatar providing him with a jet (161), though the specific nature of this jet arrangement isn't clear from the headline alone. These developments suggest evolving security and economic relationships between the U.S. and Gulf states, with significant financial commitments involved.

Republican legislators have introduced a series of bills aimed at eliminating major federal agencies. These include H.R.3345 to abolish the Department of Education (104), H.R.3347 to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and replace it with a block grant program for disaster relief (118), and H.R.3346 to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (129). These bills represent substantial proposals to restructure the federal government by eliminating agencies responsible for education, environmental protection, and disaster response, reflecting a significant push toward reducing the federal regulatory apparatus.

Congressional Republicans are advancing proposals that would significantly reshape social welfare programs. The New York Times reports that House Republicans are moving forward with plans to reduce taxes while simultaneously cutting Medicaid and food assistance programs (171). The Hechinger Report notes that while conservatives advocate for increased birth rates, proposed congressional cuts could negatively impact families with young children (159). Specific legislative proposals include Senate bill S.1761, which seeks to eliminate unemployment benefits for unemployed millionaires (150). Meanwhile, MSNBC characterizes a Republican "senior bonus" as a political gesture to Social Security recipients (170), though details of this bonus aren't specified in the headline. These developments suggest a broad effort to restructure social safety net programs while implementing targeted benefits for specific constituencies.

Congressional activities extend beyond legislation to include political tensions and electoral considerations. The Hill reports on an exchange between an individual named Homan and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, regarding her warning of "problems" if Democrats face arrests (105), though context for these potential arrests isn't provided. Democratic strategist James Carville has urged calm, claiming Democrats are winning elections "left and right" (110), while Newsweek reports on a Democratic electoral setback with chaotic aftermath (122). Notably, the New Republic cites a "MAGA Senator" acknowledging that Republican policies are negatively affecting Trump voters (124), though the specific senator and policies aren't identified in the headline. People magazine reported that three members of Congress fell asleep during extended budget deliberations (164), highlighting the intense schedule of recent legislative sessions.

  Topic 6.1: Supreme Court Cases & Constitutional Issues (Topic Importance: 8)
  
Bloomberg reports that President Trump is seeking to suspend habeas corpus, a fundamental legal protection that allows individuals to challenge their detention in court (135). The headline frames this as an explanatory piece about both the nature of habeas corpus and Trump's reasons for wanting to suspend it. This development has significant constitutional implications, as habeas corpus is a foundational legal right in the American judicial system, and its suspension is strictly limited under the Constitution to cases of rebellion or invasion when public safety requires it.

Recent law enforcement actions have targeted both high-profile figures and judicial officials. A co-founder of Ben & Jerry's ice cream was arrested after protesting against the Gaza blockade during a U.S. Senate hearing (106, 136, 179). In a separate case, Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges related to allegedly helping a man evade immigration authorities (144, 163). The headlines indicate she faces two federal criminal charges, though specific details aren't provided. Additionally, a Russian scientist is being held in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility on charges of smuggling frog embryos into the United States (168). These cases highlight law enforcement actions spanning from protest-related arrests to charges against a sitting judge and allegations of biological smuggling.

Multiple developments suggest shifting approaches to civil rights and legal protections. ProPublica reports that the Trump administration is reducing enforcement of fair housing laws (130), though specific mechanisms of this weakening aren't specified in the headline. Public media organizations are defending their operations before both Congress and the courts amid what NPR characterizes as "attacks" (113), suggesting challenges to public broadcasting funding or operations. In a significant judicial development, the Supreme Court has expanded the legal standard for determining what constitutes unreasonable force by police officers (173), potentially making it easier for citizens to pursue claims against law enforcement for excessive force. These headlines point to evolving tensions between civil liberties, government authority, and institutional protections.

  Topic 7.1: Healthcare & Public Health Initiatives (Topic Importance: 7)
  
President Trump's healthcare approach emphasizes artificial intelligence over traditional medical care and insurance coverage, according to Rolling Stone's characterization (151). The Associated Press reports that Trump's nominee for Surgeon General has publicly endorsed experimental psychedelic therapies and personally credited mushrooms with helping her find romantic relationship success (189). At the state level, proposed reductions to Medicaid and other healthcare services are predicted to cause "actual harm" to Idaho residents (121). In a case highlighting the intersection of healthcare and state laws regarding pregnancy, a family reports that a woman declared brain dead remains on life support due to her pregnancy under applicable state law (181). These headlines reflect diverse healthcare policy developments at both federal and state levels, from novel AI approaches to controversial personnel selections and contentious state-level policies.

Environmental policy controversies span from land use to nuclear waste management. Inside Climate News reports strong local opposition to a plan characterized as "insane" that would sell 500,000 acres of public lands for housing development in Nevada and Utah (102). Meanwhile, The Guardian warns that budget cuts proposed by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could undermine efforts to clean up millions of gallons of nuclear waste from wartime activities (131). These headlines suggest tensions between development interests, environmental protection, government efficiency initiatives, and the remediation of legacy environmental hazards.

A Wyoming community that initially reached consensus on establishing a charter school has subsequently experienced deep divisions over the implementation of this educational alternative, according to Wyofile (187). While the headline doesn't specify the nature of these divisions, it suggests that agreement on the general concept of charter schools doesn't necessarily translate to harmony regarding their specific implementation. This local education controversy reflects broader debates about school choice and educational alternatives.

  Topic 7.4: State & Local Political Developments (Topic Importance: 5)
  
State and local political developments reflect diverse policy approaches and political responses across the country. In Texas, a sponsor of the state's abortion ban is working to clarify circumstances under which doctors can legally perform the procedure (128), suggesting potential refinements to the restrictive law. California Governor Gavin Newsom has attributed his state's $12 billion budget deficit to what he terms a "Trump slump," claiming California is "under assault" from federal policies (167). Arizona has joined several states requiring identification verification for accessing online pornography (162), reflecting a state-level approach to digital content regulation.

Scientific American has published an article suggesting that scientific analysis indicates the U.S. is moving toward dictatorship (157), while Newsweek reports a shift in President Trump's approval ratings among Millennial voters (127). Cultural figures have also weighed in on the political climate, with musician Bruce Springsteen criticizing what he termed "treasonous" aspects of "Trump's America" (148), and actor Robert De Niro expressing urgent concerns about the current political situation (147).

Some articles suggest personal impacts of the political climate, with The Daily Beast reporting increased American emigration to Spain attributed to a "Trump Nightmare" (97). At the organizational level, a Wyoming research group known for migration studies reportedly faces existential threat from what are characterized as Trump administration "liquidation plans" (132). These diverse headlines reflect varied political, cultural, and personal responses to current national leadership and policies across different states and constituencies.

The Trump administration is organizing a military parade that includes 25 Abrams tanks (190) and coincides with the President's birthday (176). The event has drawn attention for its costs, though specific figures aren't provided in the headlines. In business directives, President Trump has instructed Apple not to expand iPhone production in India (117), with reports quoting Trump saying "I had a little problem with Tim Cook" (182) and reportedly telling Cook "I treated you very good" (143). Another executive action involves directing troops to applaud a podcast host who supported Trump's campaign (154). Media commentary includes Lawrence O'Donnell's characterization of Trump as "too stupid" to recognize alleged humiliation regarding what O'Donnell describes as a $400 million jet gift (101), though details about this gift are limited in the headlines.

  Topic 1.3: DOGE Operations & Efficiency Initiatives (Topic Importance: 7)
  
NBC News reports that international criminal organizations are allegedly stealing approximately one trillion dollars annually from U.S. government programs, citing findings from an anti-fraud firm. The same report suggests the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is taking minimal action to address this fraud issue (188). The headline indicates a potential disconnect between DOGE's efficiency mission and its response to this reported fraud problem.

ProPublica reports that the Trump administration has pressured African nations to advance business opportunities for Elon Musk (114). The headline doesn't specify whether these business opportunities relate to Musk's role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) or his private business interests. Separately, The Guardian reports that the administration is planning to reduce banking regulations that were implemented following the 2008 financial crisis to prevent similar economic downturns (116).

A Republican tax bill currently under consideration is reportedly obscuring its potential impact on the national debt, with analysis suggesting it could increase U.S. debt by more than $1 trillion (109, 142). The legislation contains controversial provisions, including one that could apply a "terrorism" label to non-profit organizations opposed to Trump, according to The Guardian (138), and another proposing taxes on remittances that migrants and visa holders send to their home countries (178). The bill faces potential internal resistance from New York Republican representatives concerned about provisions affecting property owner tax write-offs (123).

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon continues to warn that a recession remains possible for the United States, even after a reduction in China tariffs (134, 155). CBS News reports an analysis indicating that most Americans earn insufficient wages to cover basic living expenses (149). U.S. wholesale prices decreased by 0.5% in the previous month despite the implementation of tariffs by the Trump administration, according to the Associated Press (169). However, CNN suggests that falling prices might be attributed to concerning economic factors rather than positive developments (183), though specific factors aren't detailed in the headline.

Meanwhile, Fox News reports a significant development in U.S.-China trade talks that extends beyond tariff reductions (153), though specific details of this "breakthrough" aren't provided in the headline.

NPR characterizes this as bringing a "once-fringe theory on birthright citizenship" to the nation's highest court (100). During oral arguments, justices appeared to question aspects of Trump's order, according to CNBC (177). The case also involves consideration of whether lower courts should be permitted to issue nationwide injunctions against such executive actions (99). The numerous headlines from diverse media sources underscore the constitutional significance of this case, which addresses foundational citizenship rights.

The Trump administration's refugee policies regarding South Africans have sparked debate. Democracy Now reports that the U.S. is welcoming white South Africans as refugees based on what the outlet characterizes as false claims by President Trump about "genocide" in South Africa (145). This policy has prompted analysis from a historian who grew up under apartheid, questioning whether white South Africans genuinely qualify as refugees, according to Vox (185). These headlines suggest scrutiny of the factual basis and potential racial implications of refugee acceptance criteria.

Rolling Stone characterizes President Trump's healthcare approach as emphasizing artificial intelligence over traditional medical care and insurance coverage (151). The Associated Press reports that Trump's nominee for Surgeon General has publicly endorsed experimental psychedelic therapies and personally credited mushrooms with helping her find romantic relationship success (189), though the nominee isn't named in the headline.

====================
    Round 14
    User: 
====================

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# DAILY BRIEFING: May 2025
## CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP ANALYSIS

### 1. EXECUTIVE BRANCH & WHITE HOUSE

#### 1.1 Executive Orders & Administrative Actions  
The Trump administration is organizing a military parade featuring 25 Abrams tanks [1] to coincide with the President's birthday [2].

Explanation of Revisions Made in Step 7:
• In Section 1.1, the duplicate Apple production citation was removed so that only the CNBC quote is retained.
• In Section 2.2, the New York GOP tax bill detail ([4]) was dropped.
• In Section 2.3, one Walmart tariff citation was removed to avoid redundancy.
• In Section 3.1, the BBC headline was removed and the Reddit discussion thread citation was eliminated.
• In Section 5.2, the Slate amendment reference was dropped.
• In Section 7.2, the Texas abortion ban sponsor reference was removed.
These reductions brought our total citation count to 50, meeting the requirement that citations be within 30–50 items, with each citation now displaying the original title and its full URL in the required format.

====================
    Round 19
    User: 
====================

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!


====================
    Round 19
    Assistant: 
====================

I'll finalize the report following your requirements for formatting and citation style. Let me carefully review the content to ensure there are no hallucinations while maintaining all the information from step7.txt.

My review plan:
1. Check proper formatting for titles and headers
2. Ensure proper citation placement throughout text
3. Verify all reference lists use proper Markdown formatting with two spaces at the end of each line
4. Perform fact-checking against the original news headlines
5. Apply the exact start/end markers as requested
