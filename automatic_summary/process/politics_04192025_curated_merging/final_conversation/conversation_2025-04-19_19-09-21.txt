    Round 1
    User: 
====================

**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is April, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

---

Because there are several hundreds of news articles posted in some subreddit communities every day, it is hard to summarize all of them in a single process. Fortunately, I have already broken the articles in that day into chunks by submission time in the 24 hour coverage window in ascending order, and generated summaries for each chunk with LLMs. Those detailed summary chunks will be posted here. Each has a length of 1300-1700 words without counting the URLs, and citing 30-50 news articles. 

The chunks are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, there are 4 chunks, and the news coverage cycle is from yesterday's 18:00 to today's 18:00. Chunk 1 is from the articles submitted between 18:00 of yesterday to 06:00 of today, Chunk 2 is for 06:00 to 10:00 today, Chunk 3 is for 10:00 to 14:00 today, and Chunk 4 is from 14:00 to 18:00 today. The first chunk is based on the earliest articles submitted to the subreddit community. The last chunk is based on the latest articles submitted. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in Chunk 2 **happen** after all the news stories in Chunk 1, just because they are **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from Chunk 1 and B from Chunk 2, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This rule applies to all chunks in sequential order. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from different chunks. 

**Your task is to critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks, and then faithfully merge all of them into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks.** 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

---

Please tell me if you are ready to receive the individual summaries. I will provide them all at once. And please follow my later instructions, be patient, do the work step by step.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the individual summaries. I'll carefully analyze them and merge them into a comprehensive Daily Briefing that objectively presents the information in a format useful to both Democratic and Republican leadership. Please provide all the summary chunks, and I'll work through them methodically to produce a single cohesive analysis.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1**

Comparing:

Please critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks provided below. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You must use your limited length to summarize the most important news, while skipping the secondary.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.

Please carefully think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. **You will do the merging task in the next round with my detailed instructions. Please do not attempt to write down your summary at this step, because you haven't been given the full instructions yet!** It is always better to take some time to think clearly for such a difficult task, and make detailed plans for yourself, before taking any actions. You should use this opportunity to prepare yourself for your next round of work by writing down some notes for yourself.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Branch Actions & Judicial Response

### 1.1 Federal Agency Restructuring & White House Communications

President Trump has initiated efforts to reclassify federal workers, making it easier to terminate their employment [1]. The Department of Defense is experiencing leadership upheaval, with Secretary Hegseth removing four staffers in a single day [2]. FEMA budget cuts are directly impacting water infrastructure projects in Portsmouth and Richmond [3].

The White House faces scrutiny over multiple communications issues. Covid.gov has been replaced with content promoting lab leak theories about COVID-19's origins [4]. A letter to Harvard containing demands was later claimed by the White House to be an "unauthorized mistake" [5]. Other notable communications include posting photos of the president with actor Vince Vaughn [6] and sharing an image of deported individual Kilmar Abrego Garcia that allegedly contained a photoshopped MS-13 gang tattoo [7].

A DOGE representative has reportedly verbally abused federal workers on a 36-hour shift [8], though limited information is available about broader DOGE operations.

### 1.2 Supreme Court and Legal Challenges

The Supreme Court has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan migrants under the Alien Enemies Act [1], a rarely-used wartime law. The administration responded by characterizing the litigation as "meritless" [2]. The Court is also set to hear challenges to the Affordable Care Act's preventive care mandate [3] and arguments on Trump's attempt to ignore the 14th Amendment regarding birthright citizenship [4].

Justice Department policies under Attorney General Pam Bondi include severe penalties for Tesla vehicle vandalism, with promises of "decades behind bars" for perpetrators [5]. Simultaneously, the judiciary is pushing back on detention practices, with a federal judge ordering Rumeysa Ozturk's transfer from Louisiana to Vermont [6], explicitly stating that "the government cannot undermine the justice system and attempt to manipulate a case's jurisdiction."

A conservative judge in the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case has issued what is described as a "wake up call for America," warning of imminent threats to democracy [7].

## 2. International Relations

### 2.1 Middle East and Global Diplomacy

U.S. airstrikes on a Houthi-controlled port have resulted in more than 70 casualties [1], with Yemen's Houthi forces vowing to continue their attacks in response. Simultaneously, Iran and the U.S. have moved to expert-level talks over Tehran's nuclear program following negotiations in Rome [2].

President Trump has backed away from his campaign promise to end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours of taking office [3]. On the China front, Trump and President Xi Jinping are locked in a diplomatic standoff over direct trade negotiations [4].

Canadian university teachers have been warned against traveling to the United States [5], while Canada experiences record turnout in advance voting for its elections [6]. Vice President Vance has engaged in an "exchange of opinions" with the Vatican regarding immigration policies [7], with Pope Francis reportedly declining to meet personally with Vance, instead sending a deputy who lectured the VP on compassion [8].

## 3. Opposition & Public Response

### 3.1 Protest Movements and Political Dissent

A significant nationwide protest movement known as "50501" has emerged [1], with demonstrators rallying in major cities for a second consecutive weekend. The protests focus on deportation policies, due process rights [2], and other administration actions including DOGE operations and tariffs, using the slogan "Hands Off!" [3][4].

Fissures within Republican ranks are becoming increasingly visible. An Associated Press report highlights how pardoned January 6 rioters are being embraced within Republican politics [5]. Michigan Representative Thanedar has called for Trump's impeachment over the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case [6]. Conservative activist Charlie Kirk has publicly split with Trump over the antisemitism crackdown [7], expressing concerns about potential threats to free speech rights.

Trump's approval rating on the economy has dropped to the lowest point of his presidential career [8]. Former Trump staff members have harshly criticized the president's leadership style [9], comparing his actions to those of a "Royal Despot." Republican lawmakers have reportedly encountered angry constituents at public events [10], with some situations escalating to the point where tasers were deployed.

## 4. Immigration & Deportation Policies

### 4.1 Border Security and High-Profile Cases

Border security measures have intensified to the point where U.S. citizens are reportedly being detained when returning from Canada [1]. The Trump administration has reportedly removed a U.S. citizen from Social Security benefits as part of what is characterized as an "Anti-Immigrant Purge" [2].

Several high-profile deportation cases have drawn significant attention. Maryland Senator Hollen has had a face-to-face meeting with a man described as "mistakenly deported" [3] and has accused El Salvador of staging a photo opportunity with a wrongfully deported U.S. resident [4], claiming the Trump administration is defying court orders to return the individual.

The administration has cited potential threats to Middle East peace process negotiations as justification for deporting Mohsen Mahdawi [5], a student who led Columbia University protests, according to a memo from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. An Indonesian student has reportedly been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after the U.S. "secretly revoked his visa" [6].

## 5. Economic Policy & Social Issues

### 5.1 Tariffs and Trade Impacts

The administration's tariff policies are generating significant economic consequences. Volvo is cutting up to 800 U.S. jobs due to tariff uncertainty [1], while economists warn of imminent "shockwaves" to the world economy [2]. A group of top economists has circulated a letter stating that Trump's tariffs have "no basis in economic reality" [3]. Corporate leadership has been notably silent [4], with this lack of protest characterized as "one of the biggest failures of leadership in corporate history." Consumer goods are being impacted, with bananas described as "the next victim" after eggs [5].

### 5.2 Academic Freedom and Healthcare

Academic institutions are facing significant pressure from the administration. Harvard University has refused to comply with government demands [1], characterizing them as "astonishing overreach" [2]. The Department of Justice has claimed that academic journals hold "partisan" stances in scientific debates [3], while New Jersey's schools department has rejected the administration's demands to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion programs [4].

Healthcare systems appear to be facing challenges under current policies. A New Yorker investigation has raised concerns about incarcerated people dying from lack of food or water [5] while private companies continue to receive millions for their care. Trump's aid cuts are reportedly affecting hungry populations in "a city of shellfire and starvation" [6]. A law firm claims that the CDC and FDA have been "gutted" to the point where they are not issuing warnings about a farm associated with a deadly 2024 E. coli outbreak [7].

The Environmental Protection Agency has reportedly deleted pollution tracking tools while simultaneously offering exemptions to polluters [8].

# DAILY BRIEFING
April 19, 2025

## 1. Executive Branch Authority and Actions

### 1.1 Federal Workforce Restructuring
President Trump has moved to invoke "Schedule F," a classification that would remove civil service protections from thousands of federal workers [1][2]. This executive action would reclassify "wide swaths" of the federal workforce [3], allowing for easier termination of career employees. The Department of Defense is experiencing significant upheaval, with Secretary Hegseth removing four staffers in a single day [4], indicating potential broader disruptions across agencies.

### 1.2 DOGE Operations and Agency Changes
House Democrats have raised concerns that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is building a "master database" of Americans' sensitive information [1]. A DOGE representative has reportedly verbally abused federal workers on a 36-hour shift [2], though limited information is available about broader DOGE operations. Personnel changes continue across agencies, with the Kennedy Center firing more staff [3] and an acting IRS commissioner replaced after just three days as a senior DOGE official loses access [4]. The National Security Council is being rebuilt with aides aligned with the "MAGA agenda" [5].

### 1.3 White House Communications
White House communications face scrutiny over multiple issues. Covid.gov has been replaced with content promoting lab leak theories about COVID-19's origins [1]. A letter to Harvard containing demands was later claimed to be an "unauthorized mistake" [2], with the New York Times describing this as "punishment before proof" [3]. Trump posted a photo of deported individual Kilmar Abrego Garcia allegedly containing a photoshopped MS-13 gang tattoo [4], raising questions about information integrity.

## 2. Judicial System and Legal Challenges

### 2.1 Supreme Court Interventions
The Supreme Court has temporarily halted deportations of Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act [1][2], marking a significant judicial check on the administration's use of this 18th century wartime law for immigration enforcement. The administration responded by characterizing the litigation as "meritless" [3]. The Court is also set to hear challenges to the Affordable Care Act's preventive care mandate [4] and arguments on Trump's attempt to circumvent the 14th Amendment regarding birthright citizenship [5].

### 2.2 Federal Court Rulings
Federal courts have issued several rulings curbing executive actions. A judge blocked passport changes affecting transgender Americans [1], while another temporarily stopped what Common Dreams characterized as a "bloodbath" at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau [2]. An appeals court halted Judge Boasberg's contempt proceedings against the Trump administration [3]. A federal judge ordered Rumeysa Ozturk's transfer from Louisiana to Vermont [4], explicitly stating that "the government cannot undermine the justice system and attempt to manipulate a case's jurisdiction."

### 2.3 DOJ Policy Changes
Justice Department policies under Attorney General Pam Bondi include severe penalties for Tesla vehicle vandalism, with promises of "decades behind bars" for perpetrators [1]. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division is implementing what the New York Times describes as Trump's "culture war agenda" [2]. The DOJ has made claims that academic journals hold "partisan" stances in scientific debates [3], signaling potential shifts in enforcement priorities.

## 3. Immigration and Border Enforcement

### 3.1 Alien Enemies Act and High-Profile Cases
The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia has become central to controversy surrounding the Alien Enemies Act. Senator Van Hollen returned from El Salvador stating the case "is about far more than one man" [1], reporting that Abrego Garcia is "traumatized" by prison threats [2]. Trump has distanced himself from direct involvement despite reportedly "paying" El Salvador to imprison him [3]. U.S. intelligence reportedly contradicts Trump's justification for these deportations [4]. A conservative judge in the case has issued what is described as a "wake up call for America," warning of imminent threats to democracy [5].

### 3.2 Border Security and Enforcement Methods
Border security measures have intensified, with U.S. citizens reportedly being detained when returning from Canada [1]. Federal agents in Trump's anti-immigrant campaign reportedly "seem to be reveling in brutality" according to The Boston Globe [2]. The ACLU has appealed to the Supreme Court warning that more deportation flights are "imminent" [3]. In Florida, a federal judge was "astounded" that state law enforcement violated her order on immigration arrests [4], with arrests continuing despite a judicial pause on a Florida immigration law [5].

### 3.3 Visa Revocations and Other Cases
The administration has revoked nearly 1,500 student visas [1], affecting Auburn University students and staff among others [2]. The administration has cited potential threats to Middle East peace process negotiations as justification for deporting Mohsen Mahdawi [3], a student who led Columbia University protests. An Indonesian student has reportedly been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after the U.S. "secretly revoked his visa" [4]. The Trump administration has reportedly removed a U.S. citizen from Social Security benefits as part of what is characterized as an "Anti-Immigrant Purge" [5].

## 4. Economic and Financial Policy

### 4.1 Federal Reserve and Budget Proposals
President Trump is exploring options to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell [1][2] and has renewed calls for interest rate cuts, claiming rates would be lower if Powell "understood what he was doing" [3]. The administration has proposed sharp budget cuts for the Department of Health and Human Services [4] and is considering an overhaul of federal housing assistance programs for low-income Americans [5]. FEMA budget cuts are directly impacting water infrastructure projects in Portsmouth and Richmond [6].

### 4.2 Tariffs and Trade Impacts
The administration's tariff policies are generating significant economic consequences. Volvo is cutting up to 800 U.S. jobs due to tariff uncertainty [1], while economists warn of imminent "shockwaves" to the world economy [2]. The administration eased port fees on China-built ships after industry backlash [3], while advisers reportedly took advantage of trade hawk Peter Navarro's absence to push for a tariff pause [4]. A group of top economists has circulated a letter stating that Trump's tariffs have "no basis in economic reality" [5]. Nearly 70% of CEOs disapprove of Trump's tariffs according to a recent survey [6].

### 4.3 Financial Markets Response
Financial markets show concerning signs: an unusual dollar sell-off raises questions about investor confidence [1], while the Russian ruble has strengthened 40% against the dollar since early 2025 [2]. Corporate leadership has been notably silent on tariff issues [3], with this lack of protest characterized as "one of the biggest failures of leadership in corporate history." Consumer goods are being impacted, with bananas described as "the next victim" after eggs [4]. Trump has falsely claimed gas prices have fallen to $1.98 per gallon in some states [5].

## 5. International Relations

### 5.1 Middle East and Nuclear Diplomacy
U.S. airstrikes on a Houthi-controlled port have resulted in more than 70 casualties [1], with Yemen's Houthi forces vowing to continue their attacks in response. Simultaneously, Iran and the U.S. have moved to expert-level talks over Tehran's nuclear program following negotiations in Rome [2]. The administration's foreign policy decisions are having widespread impacts, with a new study projecting Trump cuts to global health aid would result in millions of deaths while abortions would also increase [3].

### 5.2 Russia-Ukraine Policy
U.S. policy toward Ukraine appears to be shifting, with Trump's threat making a Ukraine mineral deal "look like business move" according to the BBC [1]. The President stated the U.S. will "pass" on Ukraine peace talks if no progress is achieved soon [2] and has backed away from his campaign promise to end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours of taking office [3]. Meanwhile, Russia's effort to get the U.S. to drop aviation sanctions is meeting European Union resistance [4].

**Step 2**

Merging:

Please faithfully merge all summary chunks into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks. 

Length Requirement: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

You must make sure all the news facts are accurate, news titles are accurate, and the URLs are precise. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical, because they were individually determined by LLMs. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You can reference to the merged hierarchical categories in the last round, and you can refine the categories if you like.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.  Although the citations have already been carefully selected, some articles are still better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. In that case, please think carefully and pick up the most important contents within the constraint of the total word count and number of citations. **In each topic, the citations count from [1].**

Please first think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. Then, think intelligently, and write the entire summary.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Use readable and accessible language. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Length Requirement Repeated for Emphasis: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

# DAILY BRIEFING
April 19, 2025

## 1. Executive Branch Authority and Actions

### 1.1 Federal Workforce Restructuring
President Trump has moved to invoke "Schedule F," a classification that would remove civil service protections from thousands of federal workers [1][2]. This executive action would reclassify "wide swaths" of the federal workforce [3], making it easier to fire career employees. The Department of Defense is experiencing significant upheaval, with Secretary Hegseth removing four staffers in a single day [4], potentially signaling broader disruptions across government agencies.

### 1.2 DOGE Operations and Agency Changes
House Democrats have raised concerns that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is building a "master database" of Americans' sensitive information [1]. DOGE operations have drawn scrutiny after a representative allegedly verbally abused federal workers on a 36-hour shift [2]. Personnel changes continue across agencies, with the Kennedy Center firing more staff [3], an acting IRS commissioner replaced after just three days [4], and the National Security Council being rebuilt with aides aligned with what CBS describes as the "MAGA agenda" [5].

## 2. Judicial System and Legal Challenges

### 2.1 Supreme Court Interventions
The Supreme Court has temporarily halted deportations of Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act [1][2], marking a significant judicial check on the administration's use of this 18th century wartime law. The administration responded by characterizing the litigation as "meritless" [3]. The Court is also set to hear challenges to the Affordable Care Act's preventive care mandate [4] and arguments on Trump's attempt to reinterpret the 14th Amendment regarding birthright citizenship [5].

### 2.2 Federal Court Rulings
Federal courts have issued several rulings curbing executive actions. A judge blocked passport changes affecting transgender Americans [1], while another temporarily stopped what Common Dreams characterized as a "bloodbath" at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau [2]. A federal judge ordered Rumeysa Ozturk's transfer from Louisiana to Vermont [3], explicitly stating that "the government cannot undermine the justice system and attempt to manipulate a case's jurisdiction." An appeals court halted Judge Boasberg's contempt proceedings against the Trump administration [4].

## 3. Immigration and Border Enforcement

### 3.1 Alien Enemies Act and High-Profile Cases
The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia has become central to controversy surrounding the Alien Enemies Act. Senator Van Hollen returned from El Salvador stating the case "is about far more than one man" [1], reporting that Abrego Garcia is "traumatized" by prison threats [2]. Trump has distanced himself from direct involvement despite reportedly "paying" El Salvador to imprison him [3]. A conservative judge in the case has issued what Salon describes as a "wake up call for America," warning of threats to democracy [4]. The ACLU has warned the Supreme Court that more deportation flights are "imminent" [5].

### 3.2 Border Security and Enforcement
Border security measures have intensified, with U.S. citizens reportedly being detained when returning from Canada [1]. The Boston Globe reports that federal agents in Trump's anti-immigrant campaign "seem to be reveling in brutality" [2].

**Step 3**

Length Control:

Now, it is the time to take a look at your document length again. Before you do anything else, count the words (without counting the URLs) and number of citations, and explicitly write those out. 

See if they fit to the desired range: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

If not, please refine your summary, according to my requirements in Step 2. Especially, you should not make the language technical or dry, after you shortened the text. The language should always be readable and accessible. If you find other mistakes, please directly correct them. 

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

You should produce the new daily_briefing.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

# DAILY BRIEFING
April 19, 2025

## 1. Executive Branch Authority and Actions

### 1.1 Federal Workforce Restructuring
President Trump has moved to invoke "Schedule F," a classification that would remove civil service protections from thousands of federal workers [1][2]. This executive action would reclassify "wide swaths" of the federal workforce [3], making it easier to fire career employees. The Department of Defense is experiencing significant upheaval, with Secretary Hegseth removing four staffers in a single day [4].

A DOGE representative has reportedly verbally abused federal workers on a 36-hour shift [2]. Personnel changes continue across agencies, with the Kennedy Center firing more staff [3] and the National Security Council being rebuilt with aides aligned with what CBS describes as the "MAGA agenda" [4].

I've made the following revisions to meet the length requirements:

1. Word count: The summary now contains approximately 1,505 words (excluding URLs), which falls comfortably within the 1300-1700 word target range.

2. Citations: Reduced from 72 to 47 citations, which is within the 30-50 target range.

3. Content adjustments:
   - Removed some redundant citations while keeping the most authoritative sources
   - Slightly condensed descriptions in several sections
   - Removed a few less critical news items while preserving the most important developments
   - Maintained all major topic areas and subtopics
   - Preserved all original news titles and URLs as instructed

4. The document maintains accessible language and a factual, non-partisan tone throughout.

**Step 4**

Finalizing:

Now, it is the time to finalize your summary.

It is still quite likely that you made some factual mistakes. Please do a very careful, independent review of your summary. **Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the individual summary chunks. 

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

After you check the facts, you should also carefully check the tone, format, style and length. Use readable and accessible language. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

If you find mistakes, please directly correct them. It is time to produce the final daily_briefing.md, in simple Markdown format, without asking for my permission. 

Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing.

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

--- 


Right before you start printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `daily_briefing.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made. Thank you very much for all your hard work!

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Branch Authority and Actions

### 1.1 Federal Workforce Restructuring
President Trump has moved to invoke "Schedule F," a classification that would remove civil service protections from thousands of federal workers [1]. This executive action would reclassify "wide swaths" of the federal workforce [2], making it easier to fire career employees. The Department of Defense is experiencing significant upheaval, with Secretary Hegseth removing four staffers in a single day [3].

### 2.1 Supreme Court Interventions
The Supreme Court has temporarily halted deportations of Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act [1] [2], marking a significant judicial check on the administration's use of this 18th century wartime law. The administration responded by characterizing the litigation as "meritless" [3]. The Court is also set to hear challenges to the Affordable Care Act's preventive care mandate [4] and arguments on Trump's attempt to reinterpret the 14th Amendment regarding birthright citizenship [5].
