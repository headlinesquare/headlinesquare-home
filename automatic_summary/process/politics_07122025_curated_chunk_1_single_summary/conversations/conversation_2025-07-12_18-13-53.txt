**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is July, 2025. The executive branch expanded their power dramatically, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025], and the tech czar Elon Musk [The founder and former head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)]. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. Later, Elon Musk left DOGE, but his influence continues. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

====================Input File End======================

---

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I am ready. I have reviewed the background information, the context of my role, and the detailed 8-step workflow. I understand the critical importance of objectivity, factual accuracy based *only* on the provided materials, and the need to filter for bias from the specified news source.

I await the JSONL news feed to begin Step 1.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    Round 2
    Assistant: 
====================

Here is the analysis for Step 1.

I have reviewed all 79 headlines and established a hierarchical categorization system with 7 primary areas and 22 specific topics. This structure is designed to group related events, facilitate a clear understanding of the current political landscape, and serve as the foundation for the subsequent steps of the briefing process.

====================
    Round 3
    User: 
====================

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.


====================
    Round 3
    Assistant: 
====================

I have re-evaluated the categorization based on the provided requirements. The initial structure was solid, but I identified opportunities for refinement to improve clarity, logical grouping, and the precision of topic definitions. The updated structure below is more robust and better reflects the nuances of the news items.

***

**step1.txt**

Area 1: Executive Branch & Presidential Affairs
    Topic 1.1: Departmental Management & Personnel Changes
    Topic 1.2: Budget, Spending & Government Efficiency (DOGE)
    Topic 1.3: Presidential Conduct, Rhetoric & Polling

Area 2: Immigration & Border Policy
    Topic 2.1: ICE Enforcement, Raids & Incidents
    Topic 2.2: Judicial Rulings on Immigration Policy
    Topic 2.3: Broader Immigration Policy & Public Opinion

Area 3: Justice System, Law Enforcement & Investigations
    Topic 3.1: Epstein Case Investigation & Political Fallout
    Topic 3.2: Judicial Rulings on Police Conduct
    Topic 3.3: State-Level Crime & Political Investigations

Area 4: Economic & Trade Policy
    Topic 4.1: Tariffs & International Trade Disputes
    Topic 4.2: Federal Reserve & Monetary Policy

Area 5: Congressional & Partisan Politics
    Topic 5.1: Legislative Proposals & Activity
    Topic 5.2: Intra-Party Dynamics & Tensions
    Topic 5.3: Political Commentary & Activism

Area 6: Foreign Affairs & National Security
    Topic 6.1: U.S.-Israel/Palestine Relations
    Topic 6.2: General Foreign & Defense Policy

    Topic 7.1: Disaster Response & FEMA
    Topic 7.2: Public Health & Healthcare Policy
    Topic 7.3: Cannabis Legalization & Regulation

**Explanation of Revisions:**

After a careful review, I have made the following adjustments to the initial category list to enhance its logical coherence and utility for the briefing:

1.  **Renamed Areas and Topics for Precision:**
    *   "Area 1: Executive Branch Operations & Policy" was renamed to **"Area 1: Executive Branch & Presidential Affairs"** to better encompass stories about the President's personal conduct and polling.
    *   "Topic 1.2" was updated to **"Budget, Spending & Government Efficiency (DOGE)"** to explicitly include the prominent DOGE-related news.
    *   "Topic 1.3" was changed from "...Approval" to **"...Polling"** for a more neutral and specific term.
    *   "Area 4" was shortened to **"Economic & Trade Policy"** for conciseness.
    *   "Area 7" was renamed to **"Domestic Crises & Social Policy"** to better capture the scope of its topics.

2.  **Improved Grouping of Justice and Crime Articles:**
    *   The original "Area 3" had a broad topic for "Federal Appointments & Crime." I split this.
    *   Articles concerning state-level political scandals (Newsom's donor, Georgia Ponzi scheme) are now grouped under a new, more descriptive topic: **"Topic 3.3: State-Level Crime & Political Investigations."**
    *   A judicial ruling related to police conduct (LAPD shooting at journalists) was separated from immigration rulings, creating a more focused **"Topic 3.2: Judicial Rulings on Police Conduct"**.

3.  **Refined Political Categories:**
    *   Stories about intra-party conflicts (Fetterman vs. Mamdani, Bannon's warnings to the GOP, Tillis's independent streak) have been consolidated under **"Topic 5.2: Intra-Party Dynamics & Tensions"** for a clearer view of party cohesion.
    *   General commentary and activism (from figures like Eric Idle, Obama, and AOC) are now distinctly categorized under **"Topic 5.3: Political Commentary & Activism."**

4.  **Created a Specific Topic for Cannabis:**
    *   The two articles related to cannabis policy were distinct enough to warrant their own topic. I created **"Topic 7.3: Cannabis Legalization & Regulation"** to house them, separating this specific issue from broader domestic policy.

These changes result in a more intuitive and analytically sound framework. Each article now has a more precise and logical placement, which will improve the quality of the summary and analysis in the subsequent steps.
