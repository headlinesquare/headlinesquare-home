# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Trump Administration and Governance

### 1.1 Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and White House Operations

The Department of Government Efficiency under Elon Musk faces intense scrutiny, with The New York Times reporting DOGE is "building a surveillance state" [1]. Congress is considering H.R.3072 to codify DOGE's authority [2], while Musk has stated DOGE "should definitely" examine Federal Reserve costs [3]. Musk is expanding his influence by developing a new Texas city government [4], though his lawyer has withdrawn from the Texas attorney general race [5]. In education, colleges in some states reportedly face a "double dose of DOGE" oversight [6]. The Daily Beast reports Trump has marginalized Musk over perceived DOGE failures, sending him "back home to his cars" [7].

The White House has launched a Drudge-style website to promote Trump [8] and established special briefings for MAGA influencers [9]. The New Republic reports Trump has demanded media "just say yes" to "his version" of reality [10], while Business Insider reports Mark Zuckerberg saying "a relationship with Trump is 'necessary' for Big Tech" [11].

The employment outlook is deteriorating, with The Hill noting "companies sharply slow hiring in April" according to ADP data [3]. Consumer spending has weakened, with McDonald's reporting "its biggest sales drop since the pandemic as customers fearful of economy pull back on spending" [4].

As Trump reaches his 100-day mark, Reuters reports he "struggles to explain weak economic data" [6].

Economic impacts are becoming visible, with CNN reporting "the last boats without crippling tariffs from China are arriving" and warning of "shortages and higher prices" [4]. Local communities are feeling effects, with a "Washington state border town paying an economic toll for Trump's trade war with Canada" [5]. While Reuters reports experts are skeptical about the administration's goal of securing "90 deals in 90 days" [6], Bloomberg reports the "Trump Trade Chief Says Tariff Deals 'Close,' More Meetings This Week" [7].
