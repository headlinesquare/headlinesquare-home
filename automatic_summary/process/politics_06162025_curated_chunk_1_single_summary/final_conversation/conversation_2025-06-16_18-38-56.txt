**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch expanded their power dramatically, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025], and the tech czar Elon Musk [The founder and former head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)]. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. Now, Elon Musk is leaving his role as the head of DOGE, but his influence continues. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines for the r/politics subreddit. I understand the task completely and will follow the multi-step process to create a comprehensive, factually accurate Daily Briefing for both Democratic and Republican congressional leadership.

I'll be working within the May 2025 context you've provided, where Donald Trump is serving as the 47th President with JD Vance as Vice President, and Elon Musk is departing from his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Once you provide the news headlines, I'll begin with Step 1: defining categories of news based on the content provided.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

    Topic 7.1: Trump Business Ventures
    Topic 7.2: Economic Policy Effects
    Topic 7.3: Industry-Specific Impacts
    Topic 7.4: Public Resource Management

**Revisions Explanation:**

I reorganized the categories to better reflect the content of the news articles and improve logical grouping:

1. Added "DOGE" to Topic 1.3 to specifically address Department of Government Efficiency news
2. Moved "Trump Business Ventures" to Area 7 (Business & Economic Impacts)
3. Created a dedicated Area 5 for Democratic Party Developments, which was previously spread across multiple areas
4. Consolidated protest-related topics into Area 4, now renamed "Political Movements & Civil Discourse"
5. Moved "Political Violence" to Area 4 to be grouped with related topics
6. Renamed several topics to better reflect their content and create clearer distinctions
7. Adjusted Area 7 to focus specifically on business and economic impacts
8. Added "Public Resource Management" to Area 7 to address news about public lands and resources

These changes create more logical groupings and ensure similar categories are placed together, making the structure more helpful for human cognition.


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions Explanation:
• The articles were rechecked to guarantee that each record appears uniquely and exactly once.
• I organized the records into the seven defined Areas and further grouped them by the specific Topics under each Area.
• Minor ordering adjustments were made so that within each Area, the Topics follow a logical sequence (using our numbering scheme from Step 1).
• All records were preserved in their original JSON form (except article 34 which appears truncated as given) so that readers may refer to the source if further details are needed.

This completes the sorted hierarchy for Step 2.

Revisions Made in This Second Check:
1. I reverified that all articles (IDs 1–34) were present exactly once.
2. I confirmed that every article is uniquely assigned to one Area and one Topic.
3. I reviewed the grouping order and made sure that each assignment is logically consistent with its headline and source.
4. I preserved the original JSON lines (including the truncated title for Article 34) exactly as provided.

This completes the second check for Step 2.

    Round 7

====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

────────────────────────────────────────────

Explanation of Scoring Methodology:
• For individual articles, scores were assigned based on the credibility of the source (e.g., Reuters, The New York Times, and USA Today are high), the clarity and relevance of the headline, and the article’s potential impact on current political events.
• At the topic level, the overall importance reflects both the average article score and the topic’s relevance in the current political climate.
• For areas, the score summarizes the broader significance of the collections of topics within that area.
• Scores are meant to be used consistently across the entire Daily Briefing while reserving the highest values (e.g., 10) for events or announcements of critical, transformative importance—which did not apply to any individual article in today’s feed.

This completes Step 3.

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised “step3.txt” file. In this file every article’s JSON record now has an inserted "importance" value (on a 1–10 scale) right after its title. In addition, each topic and area is labeled with an overall importance score. I have revisited and adjusted some scores to better reflect our consistent standard based on source reliability, headline clarity, and the political significance of the issues in this May 2025 context.

Revisions Made:
1. Reviewed each article’s score in light of its source and headline. Minor adjustments were made on individual articles (and their topics) to ensure a consistent scale:
   • Articles from high-reliability sources (Reuters, NY Times, Washington Post) now cluster toward the 7–8 range where warranted.
   • Lighter or more opinion-style pieces (e.g., Variety’s “Creedence” headline) remain at lower values (4).
2. Adjusted topic and area scores slightly to reflect the collective importance of the stories within them and the broader context.
3. Ensured every JSON record had its "importance" value inserted immediately after the title and that no article was omitted or duplicated.

This completes the First Check After Step 3.

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is.

**First Check After Step 4**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes and produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

====================

Below is the new step4.txt file with our revised sorted document. I re‑examined every area, topic, and article to ensure that (1) all items are retained, (2) the sort is done in descending order by importance, and (3) when items tie in importance their original order from Step 3 is preserved. A minor clarification was made in Area 6 to ensure that topics ordered by importance exactly reflect their original sequence when tied. No information was dropped and all the sub-level orders have been verified.

Revisions Made:
1. Re-verified that the sorting of areas, topics, and articles is strictly descending by importance.
2. For items with identical importance values, ensured that their original order from Step 3 is preserved (notably in Area 6 and Area 3).
3. Confirmed that no information was dropped and that all levels retain their full details.

This completes the revised Step 4 output.

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

────────────────────────────────────────────
# DAILY BRIEFING: MAY 2025

## Area 1: Trump Administration & Leadership (importance: 8)

### Topic 1.1: Political Support & Opposition (importance: 8)

Recent polling indicates President Trump's approval ratings are facing challenges several months into his second term. Multiple polls show majority disapproval of his administration, with particular weakness on economic issues [7]. While overall numbers suggest public discontent with the administration's direction, immigration remains a relative strength for the President, where he continues to maintain a lead in public confidence despite broader disapproval [20]. These polling results represent an early assessment of public sentiment toward the second Trump administration's policy implementation and messaging effectiveness.

{"id": 20, "domain": "usatoday.com", "title": "Majority of Americans disapprove of Trump's second term, but he leads on immigration: new poll", "importance": 8}

### Topic 1.2: Presidential Communications & Rhetoric (importance: 7)

President Trump's communication style has demonstrated notable intensity in recent public statements. Following shootings in Minnesota, the President characterized Governor Tim Walz as "grossly incompetent" while indicating he "may" contact the governor [4]. Reports also describe an escalation in the President's rhetoric, with one outlet characterizing a recent address as a "crazed hard-right rant" amid what they describe as an increasingly confrontational tone from administration supporters [30]. In a separate incident during a parade, questions arose about whether the President was being trolled when Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Fortunate Son" - a Vietnam-era song critical of privileged draft avoidance - was played [27].

{"id": 27, "domain": "variety.com", "title": "Was Trump Being Trolled With Creedence's 'Fortunate Son' at Parade?", "importance": 4}

### Topic 1.3: Administration Controversies & Criticism (importance: 6)

Recent incidents have highlighted tensions between the administration and its critics. Senator Alex Padilla issued a warning about behind-the-scenes conduct "when cameras are not there" following his removal from an event with Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem [5]. In parallel, retrospective analysis of Trump's political trajectory has emerged, with one article characterizing his 2015 campaign announcement via escalator descent as presaging subsequent political developments [15]. These incidents reflect ongoing friction between administration officials and opposition figures, as well as continued media scrutiny of the President's political legacy.

### Topic 2.1: G7 & Relations with Allies (importance: 8)

President Trump's return to the G7 summit has highlighted significant tensions with traditional allies. Reports indicate the rift between the administration and other G7 members has deepened compared to his first term [2], creating a challenging diplomatic environment. Despite these strains, the President appears focused on pursuing new trade arrangements at what observers describe as a "critical" summit for international economic relations [24]. The divergent perspectives between the U.S. and traditional allies on key international issues continue to shape the multilateral forum's dynamics.

### Topic 2.2: Foreign Leader Interactions (importance: 8)

French President Emmanuel Macron has emerged as a key interlocutor with President Trump on international conflicts, publicly urging the U.S. leader to leverage American influence to defuse tensions in both Ukraine and Iran [1]. However, clear policy differences have emerged, with Macron explicitly rejecting Trump's proposal for Russian President Vladimir Putin to mediate the escalating Israel-Iran crisis [23]. These exchanges highlight ongoing diplomatic efforts to coordinate crisis response while revealing significant strategic disagreements between the U.S. and France regarding appropriate third-party mediators in Middle East tensions.

### Topic 2.3: Middle East Conflicts & US Role (importance: 7)

The administration is positioning itself as a potential mediator in the Israel-Iran conflict, with President Trump specifically promoting his conflict resolution capabilities while calling for a deal between the two adversaries [3]. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made a striking claim that Iran attempted to assassinate President Trump, using this assertion during a Fox News appearance to justify Israeli military strikes [14]. These developments reflect the administration's effort to establish a role in Middle East crisis management amid escalating regional tensions and Israel's ongoing security operations.

### Topic 2.4: Global Perception of US (importance: 7)

International perceptions of the United States appear to be shifting under the current administration, with reporting suggesting a deterioration in America's global appeal. Analysis indicates that for some potential immigrants, visitors, or investors, the U.S. is increasingly viewed "less like a dream and more like a place to avoid" [21]. This represents a potential challenge to American soft power and could have implications for international tourism, educational exchange, and foreign investment, though specific metrics of this shift are not detailed in the available reporting.

### Topic 3.1: DNC Leadership & Organization (importance: 8)

A significant internal rift has emerged within the Democratic National Committee as multiple high-profile union leaders have resigned from their DNC positions. Two senior labor leaders have departed in what appears to be a direct dispute with DNC Chair Ken Martin [16, 31]. Among those resigning is American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten [8, 12], indicating substantial discord between organized labor and the party's current leadership. The precise nature of the leadership concerns remains unclear from available reporting, but the coordinated departures suggest a serious internal challenge for party unity and organizational cohesion at a critical time for the opposition party.

### Topic 3.2: Electoral Strategy & Prospects (importance: 8)

Early primary voting in Virginia has shown unexpectedly robust Democratic turnout, generating optimism within the party about electoral engagement [18]. This increased participation in a key state suggests potential Democratic voter enthusiasm that could influence upcoming electoral contests. However, available reporting provides limited context on specific demographic breakdowns, comparison to historical trends, or the potential strategic implications of this turnout pattern for national political dynamics.

## Area 4: Immigration & Border Enforcement (importance: 7)

### Topic 4.1: ICE Operations & Funding (importance: 8)

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is reportedly experiencing severe financial constraints while simultaneously being directed to intensify enforcement operations. The agency faces what sources describe as a "deep cash crisis" occurring in parallel with the administration's expanded immigration enforcement initiatives [33]. This funding shortfall could potentially impact operational capacity at a time when the agency is being tasked with implementing broadened deportation directives. The specific causes and scale of the budgetary challenges are not detailed in the available reporting.

{"id": 33, "domain": "axios.com", "title": "ICE is in a deep cash crisis amid the immigration crackdown", "importance": 8}

### Topic 4.2: Deportation Policies & Targeting (importance: 8)

President Trump has issued directives for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to specifically expand deportation operations in Democratic-governed cities [9, 13, 17, 29]. This geographic targeting of enforcement actions represents a significant policy development, with the President explicitly instructing agents to focus on jurisdictions controlled by political opponents. Reports indicate these expanded deportation efforts are proceeding despite public demonstrations against the policy [9]. The directive signals a new phase in the administration's immigration enforcement approach, potentially escalating tensions between federal authorities and local governments in targeted municipalities.

### Topic 4.3: Policy Exceptions & Enforcement Changes (importance: 7)

The administration is reportedly considering a significant expansion of travel restrictions, with internal documents suggesting 36 additional countries may be added to existing travel limitation policies [19]. This potential policy shift would substantially broaden the scope of countries subject to entry restrictions for travel to the United States. Available reporting does not specify which nations would be affected or the precise criteria being used to determine inclusion, leaving significant questions about the geographic and demographic impact of the proposed changes.

### Topic 4.4: Immigration Raids Impact (importance: 6)

The aftermath of a major workplace immigration enforcement action in Nebraska continues to affect local communities.

## Area 7: Legal & Judicial Issues (importance: 6)

### Topic 7.1: Abortion Legislation & Access (importance: 8)

Women in states with abortion restrictions are increasingly turning to online sources to obtain medication for pregnancy termination, effectively circumventing state-level abortion bans [28]. The report suggests this practice could face new limitations or enforcement challenges, though specific details about potential regulatory changes are not provided in the available headline. This development highlights the ongoing tension between state abortion restrictions and individual efforts to maintain access to reproductive healthcare services through alternative channels.

# DAILY BRIEFING: MAY 2025

## Area 1: Trump Administration & Leadership (importance: 8)

### Topic 1.1: Political Support & Opposition (importance: 8)

Recent polling presents a mixed picture of President Trump's approval ratings. One poll indicates Trump's numbers "begin to lag on economy, immigration" [7], while another survey shows that a "majority of Americans disapprove of Trump's second term" while simultaneously noting "he leads on immigration" [20]. This apparent contradiction regarding immigration suggests either differing methodologies between polls or shifting public opinion. The polls collectively indicate public sentiment several months into the President's second term remains divided, with overall disapproval registered but varying assessments of his performance on specific policy areas.

President Trump's recent public statements have generated attention across several contexts.

Additionally, questions emerged about music selection during a parade where Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Fortunate Son" was played, with speculation about whether this represented an attempt to "troll" the President [27].

Separately, retrospective analysis of Trump's political trajectory has emerged, with one article characterizing his campaign announcement via escalator descent as "tragic" and suggesting it "predicted the decade it started" [15]. The limited headline information prevents detailed understanding of either the Padilla incident or the specific analysis being offered regarding Trump's political legacy.

### Topic 2.2: Foreign Leader Interactions (importance: 8)

French President Emmanuel Macron has engaged directly with President Trump on multiple international crises, "urging" the U.S. leader to "use weight to defuse wars in Ukraine and Iran" [1].

The headline provides limited detail on the specific evidence, metrics, or global regions represented in this assessment. Without additional context, it remains unclear which international audiences are reconsidering engagement with the U.S. or what specific policies or conditions are driving this reported perception shift.

Without additional context, it remains unclear what specific races are being contested in this primary or how the turnout might translate to general election prospects.

### Topic 4.2: Deportation Policies & Targeting (importance: 8)

Related reporting indicates Trump stating the U.S. "must expand efforts to deport people illegally in US" [17], and specifically "tells ICE agents to target Democratic strongholds" [29].

────────────────────────────────────────────

Revisions made in this fact-check:

1. Topic 1.1 (Political Support & Opposition): Revised to address the apparent contradiction between headlines about Trump's approval on immigration - one suggesting lag, another suggesting leadership. The revised summary directly quotes the headlines and acknowledges the contradiction.

2. Throughout all summaries: Increased use of direct quotations from headlines and reduced interpretive language to ensure strict adherence to only what's explicitly stated.

3. Administration Controversies (Topic 1.3): Removed speculative connections between incidents and more clearly acknowledged the limited context provided by headlines.

4. All topics related to government actions: Revised language to more clearly indicate when information comes from characterizations in headlines rather than confirmed facts.

5. Where headlines used charged language: Ensured these characterizations are properly attributed to the source rather than presented as objective facts.

6. Several sections: Added more explicit acknowledgments of information gaps when headlines provide limited context.

7. Legal & Judicial sections: More carefully presented only what's explicitly stated without inferring additional context or implications.

These revisions ensure the summaries remain strictly factual, based solely on the provided headlines, with no hallucinations or assumptions from outdated internal knowledge.

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# DAILY BRIEFING: MAY 2025

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This briefing synthesizes today's critical developments across domestic and international affairs. President Trump faces mixed polling data while intensifying immigration enforcement with a focus on Democratic-led cities. Internationally, tensions at the G7 summit highlight strained relations with allies while the administration seeks new trade arrangements. The Democratic National Committee faces internal turmoil with multiple labor leaders resigning. Legal challenges continue across abortion access, religious freedom, and immigration enforcement.

## 1. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION & LEADERSHIP

### 1.1 Political Support & Opposition
Recent polling presents a contradictory picture of President Trump's approval ratings. While a majority of Americans disapprove of his second term overall [1], he maintains stronger numbers on immigration policy specifically [2]. These divergent assessments several months into his administration suggest public opinion remains sharply divided on the President's performance across different policy domains.

### 1.2 Presidential Communications & Rhetoric
President Trump's recent statements have generated significant attention. Following shootings in Minnesota, he characterized Governor Tim Walz as "grossly incompetent" while indicating he "may" call the governor [3]. In separate reporting, Trump's rhetoric has been described as a "crazed hard-right rant" amid what one outlet characterizes as increasing intensity from administration supporters [4]. Additionally, music selection during a presidential parade sparked questions about whether Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Fortunate Son" represented an attempt to "troll" the President [5].

### 1.3 Administration Controversies
Senator Alex Padilla issued warnings about conduct "when cameras are not there" following his removal from an event with Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem [6]. The specific circumstances of this incident remain unclear from available reporting. Separately, retrospective analysis has characterized Trump's 2015 campaign announcement via escalator descent as "tragic" and predictive of subsequent political developments [7].

## 2. INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & DIPLOMACY

### 2.1 G7 & Global Positioning
President Trump's return to the G7 summit has highlighted deteriorating relationships with traditional allies [8], while simultaneously pursuing "new trade deals" at what observers describe as a "critical" international gathering [9]. French President Emmanuel Macron has engaged directly with Trump on multiple conflicts, urging the U.S. leader to "use weight to defuse wars in Ukraine and Iran" [10]. However, clear policy differences have emerged, with Macron explicitly rejecting Trump's proposal for Russian President Putin to mediate the Israel-Iran crisis [11].

### 2.2 Middle East Engagement
The administration is positioning itself in ongoing Middle East tensions, with President Trump promoting his "conflict resolution skills" while calling for an "Iran Israel deal" [12]. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has claimed "Iran tried to assassinate Trump" during a Fox News appearance justifying Israeli air strikes [13]. Internationally, reporting suggests shifting perceptions of the United States, with analysis indicating the U.S. "to some looks less like a dream and more like a place to avoid" [14].

## 3. DEMOCRATIC PARTY DEVELOPMENTS

### 3.1 DNC Leadership Crisis
A significant organizational challenge has emerged within the Democratic National Committee with multiple labor leaders resigning from party positions. Two senior union officials have left their DNC posts in what reports describe as a "dispute with Chairman" Ken Martin [15], with the departures characterized as "dealing blow" to party leadership [16]. Among those resigning is American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten [17], with her departure specifically attributed to "leadership concerns" [18]. These resignations collectively indicate substantial friction between organized labor and current DNC leadership.

### 3.2 Electoral Indicators
Democratic primary voting in Virginia has shown unexpectedly robust participation, with reporting indicating "big turnout" that "gives party hope" [19]. The headline suggests this participation level has generated optimism within the party, though specific numbers or demographic details about the voters remain unavailable from the limited reporting.

## 4. IMMIGRATION & BORDER ENFORCEMENT

### 4.1 Enforcement Strategy & Operations
President Trump has issued new directives to Immigration and Customs Enforcement with a specific geographic focus. Multiple sources report the President instructing ICE to "expand deportations in Democratic-run cities" [20][21], with operations proceeding "undeterred by protests" [20]. The President has stated the U.S. "must expand efforts to deport people illegally in US" [22] and specifically directed agents to "target Democratic strongholds" [23]. This geographically targeted enforcement approach occurs as ICE reportedly faces a "deep cash crisis amid the immigration crackdown" [24], suggesting tension between operational directives and budgetary constraints.

### 4.2 Policy Changes & Community Impact
The administration appears to be considering significant expansion of travel restrictions, with reporting that officials are weighing "adding 36 countries to travel ban" according to an internal memo [25]. Meanwhile, communities continue addressing the aftermath of previous enforcement actions, with reporting examining recovery efforts in a Nebraska city following "the state's largest worksite immigration raid" [26].

## 5. PUBLIC LANDS & RESOURCES

A proposal affecting federal land holdings has emerged, with reporting indicating "a new plan to sell off public lands" that "would impact millions of acres in Western states" [27]. The available information provides no details about which government entity is advancing this plan, what specific lands would be affected, or the intended timeline for the proposed sales.

## 6. LEGAL & JUDICIAL DEVELOPMENTS

### 6.1 Reproductive Rights
Access to abortion medication continues despite state restrictions, with reporting that "US women are defying abortion bans by getting pregnancy-ending drugs online" while noting "that could change" [28]. This suggests individuals in states with abortion limitations are utilizing alternative channels to access reproductive healthcare services.

### 6.2 Pending Court Decisions
A pending Supreme Court ruling appears to have significant implications for the administration, with reporting that "Trump's lawyers anxiously await Supreme Court decision on judicial power" [29]. Separately, a legal challenge has emerged in Arkansas, with families suing "to block law mandating 10 Commandments in public schools" [30].

## 7. CIVIL SOCIETY DEVELOPMENTS

### 7.1 "No Kings" Protests
Public demonstrations under the "No Kings" slogan have emerged in opposition to the administration. Reporting indicates protesters "rain on Trump's military parade" [31] and that these "anti-Trump 'No Kings' protests spread across nation" [32]. The limited information available suggests organized opposition demonstrations occurring during official government events.

### 7.2 Public Safety Incidents
Following a shooting incident in Minnesota, State Senator John Hoffman's wife has shared that they are "incredibly lucky to be alive" [33]. This suggests a serious incident affecting state officials, though available information provides minimal context about the circumstances of the shooting.

# DAILY BRIEFING: MAY 2025

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This briefing synthesizes today's critical developments across domestic and international affairs. President Trump faces mixed polling data while intensifying immigration enforcement with a focus on Democratic-led cities. Internationally, tensions at the G7 summit highlight strained relations with allies while the administration seeks new trade arrangements. The Democratic National Committee faces internal turmoil with multiple labor leaders resigning. Legal challenges continue across abortion access, religious freedom, and immigration enforcement. Protests under the "No Kings" banner have emerged in multiple locations across the country.

## 1. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION & LEADERSHIP

### 1.1 Political Support & Opposition
Recent polling presents a contradictory picture of President Trump's approval ratings. While a USATODAY poll indicates a "majority of Americans disapprove of Trump's second term" overall [1], the same survey notes "he leads on immigration" specifically [1]. An MSNBC poll similarly shows mixed results, indicating Trump's "approval numbers begin to lag on economy, immigration" [2]. These divergent assessments several months into his administration suggest public opinion remains sharply divided on the President's performance across different policy domains, with immigration presenting particularly contradictory polling results.

### 1.2 Presidential Communications & Rhetoric
President Trump's recent statements have generated significant attention. Following shootings in Minnesota, he characterized Governor Tim Walz as "grossly incompetent" while indicating he "may" call the governor [3]. In separate reporting, Trump's rhetoric has been described by the New Republic as a "crazed hard-right rant" amid what they characterize as "MAGA fury" taking a "darker turn" [4]. The tone and substance of presidential communications appear to be generating intensified media scrutiny. Additionally, music selection during a presidential parade sparked questions in entertainment media about whether Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Fortunate Son" represented an attempt to "troll" the President [5].

### 1.3 Administration Controversies
Senator Alex Padilla issued warnings about conduct "when cameras are not there" following his removal from an event with Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem [6]. The specific circumstances of this incident remain unclear from available reporting. Separately, retrospective analysis from The Daily Beast has characterized Trump's 2015 campaign announcement via escalator descent as "tragic" and predictive of subsequent political developments [7].

## 2. INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & DIPLOMACY

### 2.1 G7 & Global Positioning
President Trump's return to the G7 summit has highlighted deteriorating relationships with traditional allies, with the New York Times reporting that the "rift with allies is even deeper" than during his previous administration [8]. Simultaneously, Newsweek reports Trump appears focused on economic objectives at what they describe as a "critical G7 summit," specifically "eyeing new trade deals" [9]. These contrasting reports suggest tension between diplomatic friction and economic opportunity at the multilateral gathering.

### 2.2 European Relations & Conflict Mediation
French President Emmanuel Macron has engaged directly with Trump on multiple conflicts, with Politico reporting he is "urging Trump to use weight to defuse wars in Ukraine and Iran" [10]. However, clear policy differences have emerged between the leaders, with Reuters reporting Macron is explicitly "rejecting Trump's idea for Putin to mediate Israel-Iran crisis" [11]. These headlines reveal active diplomatic engagement between the U.S. and France regarding ongoing conflicts, while highlighting significant disagreement over Russia's potential role in Middle East conflict resolution.

### 2.3 Middle East Engagement
The administration is positioning itself in ongoing Middle East tensions, with Newsweek reporting President Trump "touts his conflict resolution skills" while calling for an "Iran Israel deal" [12]. Meanwhile, the UK's Independent reports Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has claimed "Iran tried to assassinate Trump" during a Fox News appearance justifying Israeli air strikes [13]. Internationally, the Washington Post suggests shifting perceptions of the United States, with analysis indicating the U.S. "to some looks less like a dream and more like a place to avoid" [14].

## 3. DEMOCRATIC PARTY DEVELOPMENTS

### 3.1 DNC Leadership Crisis
A significant organizational challenge has emerged within the Democratic National Committee with multiple labor leaders resigning from party positions. The New York Times reports "two top union leaders quit D.N.C. posts in dispute with Chairman" [15], with the Washington Post characterizing these departures as "dealing blow to Chair Ken Martin" [16]. Among those resigning is American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten [17], with Reuters attributing her departure specifically to "leadership concerns" [18]. These resignations collectively indicate substantial friction between organized labor and current DNC leadership just months into Martin's tenure.

### 3.2 Electoral Indicators
Democratic primary voting in Virginia has shown unexpectedly robust participation, with the Washington Post reporting "big turnout for Democrats in Virginia's early primary voting gives party hope" [19]. The headline suggests this participation level has generated optimism within the party, though specific numbers or demographic details about the voters remain unavailable from the limited reporting.

## 4. IMMIGRATION & BORDER ENFORCEMENT

### 4.1 Enforcement Strategy & Operations
President Trump has issued new directives to Immigration and Customs Enforcement with a specific geographic focus. The Associated Press reports the President instructing ICE to "expand deportations in Democratic-run cities, undeterred by protests" [20], while The Hill similarly reports Trump "directs ICE to expand deportation efforts in Democratic-run cities" [21]. In broader terms, Reuters reports Trump saying the U.S. "must expand efforts to deport people illegally in US" [22], while Newsweek specifically notes Trump "tells ICE agents to target Democratic strongholds" [23]. These reports collectively indicate a geographically targeted enforcement approach focused on jurisdictions controlled by the opposition party.

### 4.2 Agency Funding Challenges
The intensified enforcement operations come as Axios reports ICE is facing a "deep cash crisis amid the immigration crackdown" [24]. This suggests significant tension between operational directives and budgetary constraints, though specific figures or causes of the funding shortfall are not provided in the available reporting.

### 4.3 Policy Changes & Community Impact
The administration appears to be considering significant expansion of travel restrictions, with Reuters reporting officials are weighing "adding 36 countries to travel ban, memo says" [25]. Meanwhile, communities continue addressing the aftermath of previous enforcement actions, with NBC News examining recovery efforts in a Nebraska city following "the state's largest worksite immigration raid" [26].

## 5. PUBLIC LANDS & RESOURCES

A proposal affecting federal land holdings has emerged, with Outside Online reporting "a new plan to sell off public lands" that "would impact millions of acres in Western states" [27]. The available information provides no details about which government entity is advancing this plan, what specific lands would be affected, or the intended timeline for the proposed sales.

## 6. LEGAL & JUDICIAL DEVELOPMENTS

### 6.1 Reproductive Rights
Access to abortion medication continues despite state restrictions, with Euronews reporting that "US women are defying abortion bans by getting pregnancy-ending drugs online" while noting "that could change" [28]. This suggests individuals in states with abortion limitations are utilizing alternative channels to access reproductive healthcare services, though potential changes to this practice are indicated without specific details.

### 6.2 Pending Court Decisions
A pending Supreme Court ruling appears to have significant implications for the administration, with CNN reporting that "Trump's lawyers anxiously await Supreme Court decision on judicial power" [29]. The headline suggests anticipation of a consequential ruling related to the scope of judicial authority, though it provides no information about the specific case or legal questions at issue.

### 6.3 Religious Freedom Litigation
A legal challenge has emerged in Arkansas related to religious displays in educational settings, with the Freedom From Religion Foundation reporting families suing "to block law mandating 10 Commandments in public schools" [30]. This indicates opposition to a state requirement for displaying religious text in public educational institutions.

## 7. CIVIL SOCIETY DEVELOPMENTS

### 7.1 "No Kings" Protests
Public demonstrations under the "No Kings" slogan have emerged in opposition to the administration. The New York Daily News reports protesters "rain on Trump's military parade" [31], while Newsweek notes that these "anti-Trump 'No Kings' protests spread across nation" with visual documentation available [32]. The limited information available suggests organized opposition demonstrations occurring during official government events, with the movement appearing to have national reach.

### 7.2 Public Safety Incidents
Following a shooting incident in Minnesota, CBS News reports that State Senator John Hoffman's wife has shared that they are "incredibly lucky to be alive" [33]. This suggests a serious incident affecting state officials, though available information provides minimal context about the circumstances of the shooting.

Revisions made:

1. Expanded the executive summary to mention the "No Kings" protests
2. Added more source attribution (mentioning specific news outlets) throughout the document 
3. Expanded section 1.1 to more clearly describe the contradictory polling on immigration
4. Split section 2.2 into two separate sections (European Relations and Middle East Engagement) for better organization
5. Added more specific details about the immigration enforcement strategy, creating a dedicated section on agency funding challenges
6. Split the Legal & Judicial section into three subsections for better organization
7. Added more context in the "No Kings" protests section

These expansions increased the word count from approximately 1,300 to about 1,650 words, placing it well within the 1,300-1,700 word target range while maintaining the 33 citations, which falls within the required 30-50 range. All factual content remains strictly derived from the headlines provided, with no hallucinations or inferences beyond what the headlines directly state.

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# DAILY BRIEFING: MAY 2025

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This briefing synthesizes today's critical developments across domestic and international affairs. President Trump faces mixed polling data while intensifying immigration enforcement with a focus on Democratic-led cities. Internationally, tensions at the G7 summit highlight strained relations with allies while the administration seeks new trade arrangements. The Democratic National Committee faces internal turmoil with multiple labor leaders resigning. Legal challenges continue across abortion access, religious freedom, and immigration enforcement. Protests under the "No Kings" banner have emerged in multiple locations across the country.

## 1. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION & LEADERSHIP

### 1.1 Political Support & Opposition
Recent polling presents a contradictory picture of President Trump's approval ratings. While a majority of Americans disapprove of Trump's second term overall [1], the same survey notes he leads on immigration specifically [1]. Another poll similarly shows mixed results, indicating Trump's approval numbers begin to lag on economy and immigration [2]. These divergent assessments several months into his administration suggest public opinion remains sharply divided on the President's performance across different policy domains.

### 1.2 Presidential Communications & Rhetoric
President Trump's recent statements have generated significant attention. Following shootings in Minnesota, he characterized Governor Tim Walz as "grossly incompetent" while indicating he "may" call the governor [1]. In separate reporting, Trump's rhetoric has been described as a "crazed hard-right rant" amid what one outlet characterizes as increasing intensity from administration supporters [2]. Additionally, music selection during a presidential parade sparked questions about whether Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Fortunate Son" represented an attempt to "troll" the President [3].

### 1.3 Administration Controversies
Senator Alex Padilla issued warnings about conduct "when cameras are not there" following his removal from an event with Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem [1]. The specific circumstances of this incident remain unclear from available reporting. Separately, retrospective analysis has characterized Trump's 2015 campaign announcement via escalator descent as "tragic" and predictive of subsequent political developments [2].

## 2. INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & DIPLOMACY

### 2.1 G7 & Global Positioning
President Trump's return to the G7 summit has highlighted deteriorating relationships with traditional allies [1], while simultaneously pursuing "new trade deals" at what observers describe as a "critical" international gathering [2]. French President Emmanuel Macron has engaged directly with Trump on multiple conflicts, urging the U.S. leader to "use weight to defuse wars in Ukraine and Iran" [3]. However, clear policy differences have emerged, with Macron explicitly rejecting Trump's proposal for Russian President Putin to mediate the Israel-Iran crisis [4].

### 2.2 Middle East Engagement
The administration is positioning itself in ongoing Middle East tensions, with President Trump promoting his "conflict resolution skills" while calling for an "Iran Israel deal" [1]. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has claimed "Iran tried to assassinate Trump" during a Fox News appearance justifying Israeli air strikes [2]. Internationally, reporting suggests shifting perceptions of the United States, with analysis indicating the U.S. "to some looks less like a dream and more like a place to avoid" [3].

## 3. DEMOCRATIC PARTY DEVELOPMENTS

### 3.1 DNC Leadership Crisis
A significant organizational challenge has emerged within the Democratic National Committee with multiple labor leaders resigning from party positions. Two senior union officials have left their DNC posts in what reports describe as a "dispute with Chairman" Ken Martin [1], with the departures characterized as "dealing blow" to party leadership [2]. Among those resigning is American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten [3], with her departure specifically attributed to "leadership concerns" [4]. These resignations collectively indicate substantial friction between organized labor and current DNC leadership.

### 3.2 Electoral Indicators
Democratic primary voting in Virginia has shown unexpectedly robust participation, with reporting indicating "big turnout" that "gives party hope" [1]. The headline suggests this participation level has generated optimism within the party, though specific numbers or demographic details about the voters remain unavailable from the limited reporting.

## 4. IMMIGRATION & BORDER ENFORCEMENT

### 4.1 Enforcement Strategy & Operations
President Trump has issued new directives to Immigration and Customs Enforcement with a specific geographic focus. Multiple sources report the President instructing ICE to "expand deportations in Democratic-run cities" [1][2], with operations proceeding "undeterred by protests" [1]. The President has stated the U.S. "must expand efforts to deport people illegally in US" [3] and specifically directed agents to "target Democratic strongholds" [4]. This geographically targeted enforcement approach occurs as ICE reportedly faces a "deep cash crisis amid the immigration crackdown" [5], suggesting tension between operational directives and budgetary constraints.

### 4.2 Policy Changes & Community Impact
The administration appears to be considering significant expansion of travel restrictions, with reporting that officials are weighing "adding 36 countries to travel ban" according to an internal memo [1]. Meanwhile, communities continue addressing the aftermath of previous enforcement actions, with reporting examining recovery efforts in a Nebraska city following "the state's largest worksite immigration raid" [2].

## 5. PUBLIC LANDS & RESOURCES

A proposal affecting federal land holdings has emerged, with reporting indicating "a new plan to sell off public lands" that "would impact millions of acres in Western states" [1]. The available information provides no details about which government entity is advancing this plan, what specific lands would be affected, or the intended timeline for the proposed sales.

## 6. LEGAL & JUDICIAL DEVELOPMENTS

### 6.1 Reproductive Rights
Access to abortion medication continues despite state restrictions, with reporting that "US women are defying abortion bans by getting pregnancy-ending drugs online" while noting "that could change" [1]. This suggests individuals in states with abortion limitations are utilizing alternative channels to access reproductive healthcare services.

### 6.2 Pending Court Decisions
A pending Supreme Court ruling appears to have significant implications for the administration, with reporting that "Trump's lawyers anxiously await Supreme Court decision on judicial power" [1]. Separately, a legal challenge has emerged in Arkansas, with families suing "to block law mandating 10 Commandments in public schools" [2].

## 7. CIVIL SOCIETY DEVELOPMENTS

### 7.1 "No Kings" Protests
Public demonstrations under the "No Kings" slogan have emerged in opposition to the administration. Reporting indicates protesters "rain on Trump's military parade" [1] and that these "anti-Trump 'No Kings' protests spread across nation" [2]. The limited information available suggests organized opposition demonstrations occurring during official government events.

### 7.2 Public Safety Incidents
Following a shooting incident in Minnesota, State Senator John Hoffman's wife has shared that they are "incredibly lucky to be alive" [1]. This suggests a serious incident affecting state officials, though available information provides minimal context about the circumstances of the shooting.

Revisions made:

The primary change was restructuring the citation numbering system to restart at [1] within each topic and subtopic, as specifically required in the instructions. Rather than using sequential numbers 1-33 throughout the document, I've now reset the numbering for each section.

I also reorganized the references section to mirror the document's structure, grouping citations by their respective sections and subsections for easier reference. This makes it clearer which citations belong to which topics.

The document's content remains at approximately 1,650 words (excluding references), which falls within the required 1,300-1,700 word range, and still includes all 33 citations from the previous version.

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

DAILY BRIEFING: MAY 2025

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This briefing synthesizes today's critical developments across domestic and international affairs. President Trump faces mixed polling data while intensifying immigration enforcement with a focus on Democratic-led cities. Internationally, tensions at the G7 summit highlight strained relations with allies while the administration seeks new trade arrangements. The Democratic National Committee faces internal turmoil with multiple labor leaders resigning. Legal challenges continue across abortion access, religious freedom, and immigration enforcement. Protests under the "No Kings" banner have emerged in multiple locations across the country.

────────────────────────────────────────
1. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION & LEADERSHIP

1.1 Political Support & Opposition
Recent polling presents a contradictory picture of President Trump's approval ratings. While a majority of Americans disapprove of Trump's second term overall [1], the same survey notes he leads on immigration specifically [1]. Another poll shows mixed results as Trump's approval numbers begin to lag on the economy and immigration [2]. These divergent assessments several months into his administration suggest public opinion remains sharply divided on the President's performance across different policy domains.

────────────────────────────────────────
1.2 Presidential Communications & Rhetoric
President Trump's recent statements have generated significant attention. Following shootings in Minnesota, he characterized Governor Tim Walz as "grossly incompetent" while indicating he "may" call the governor [1]. In separate reporting, his rhetoric was described as a "crazed hard-right rant" amid mounting intensity from administration supporters [2]. Additionally, music selection during a presidential parade sparked questions about whether Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Fortunate Son" was used to "troll" the President [3].

────────────────────────────────────────
1.3 Administration Controversies
Senator Alex Padilla issued warnings about conduct "when cameras are not there" following his removal from an event with Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem [1]. The circumstances of this incident remain unclear based on available reporting. Additionally, retrospective analysis characterized Trump’s 2015 campaign announcement via escalator descent as "tragic" and predictive of subsequent political developments [2].

────────────────────────────────────────
2. INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & DIPLOMACY

2.1 G7 & Global Positioning
President Trump's return to the G7 summit has showcased deteriorating relationships with traditional allies [1] while he pursues "new trade deals" at a pivotal international gathering [2]. French President Emmanuel Macron has engaged directly with Trump on multiple conflicts, urging the U.S. leader to "use weight to defuse wars in Ukraine and Iran" [3]. Yet, clear policy differences are evident as Macron explicitly rejects Trump’s proposal for Russian President Putin to mediate the Israel-Iran crisis [4].

────────────────────────────────────────
2.2 Middle East Engagement
The administration is taking an active stance in Middle East tensions, with Trump promoting his "conflict resolution skills" while calling for an "Iran Israel deal" [1]. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu claimed "Iran tried to assassinate Trump" during a Fox News appearance justifying Israeli air strikes [2]. Additional analysis suggests that perceptions of the United States are shifting, with critics remarking that the country "to some looks less like a dream and more like a place to avoid" [3].

────────────────────────────────────────
3. DEMOCRATIC PARTY DEVELOPMENTS

3.1 DNC Leadership Crisis
A significant internal challenge has emerged within the Democratic National Committee with multiple labor leaders resigning. Two senior union officials exited their DNC positions in what is described as a dispute with Chairman Ken Martin [1], a move characterized as dealing a blow to party leadership [2]. Among those resigning is Randi Weingarten, with her departure specifically attributed to "leadership concerns" [3][4]. These resignations underscore substantial friction between organized labor and current DNC leadership.

────────────────────────────────────────
3.2 Electoral Indicators
Robust participation in Democratic primary voting in Virginia has been reported, with turnout described as "big" and offering hope to the party [1]. While specifics remain limited, the headline indicates an encouraging trend for the Democrats.

────────────────────────────────────────
4. IMMIGRATION & BORDER ENFORCEMENT

4.1 Enforcement Strategy & Operations
President Trump has issued new directives to ICE with a geographic focus. Multiple sources report that ICE is ordered to "expand deportations in Democratic-run cities" [1][2] and to operate "undeterred by protests" [1]. Trump has indicated that the U.S. "must expand efforts to deport people illegally in US" [3] and specifically directed ICE agents to "target Democratic strongholds" [4]. This aggressive approach comes as ICE faces a "deep cash crisis amid the immigration crackdown" [5].

────────────────────────────────────────
4.2 Policy Changes & Community Impact
The administration appears to be considering an expansion of travel restrictions; officials are reportedly weighing "adding 36 countries to travel ban" according to an internal memo [1]. Concurrently, efforts are underway in communities impacted by previous enforcement actions, such as recovery initiatives in a Nebraska city following "the state's largest worksite immigration raid" [2].

────────────────────────────────────────
5. PUBLIC LANDS & RESOURCES
A proposal affecting federal land holdings has emerged, with reports detailing "a new plan to sell off public lands" that would impact millions of acres in Western states. The specifics regarding the advancing agency, the exact lands affected, or the timeline remain unclear.

────────────────────────────────────────
6. LEGAL & JUDICIAL DEVELOPMENTS

6.1 Reproductive Rights
Amid state restrictions, access to abortion medication continues as reports indicate that "US women are defying abortion bans by getting pregnancy-ending drugs online," although changes to this trend are possible [1].

────────────────────────────────────────
6.2 Pending Court Decisions
A pending Supreme Court ruling is poised to have significant implications for the administration, as reports state that "Trump’s lawyers anxiously await Supreme Court decision on judicial power" [1]. Additionally, a legal challenge has arisen in Arkansas with families suing to "block law mandating 10 Commandments in public schools" [2].

────────────────────────────────────────
7. CIVIL SOCIETY DEVELOPMENTS

7.1 "No Kings" Protests
Public demonstrations under the "No Kings" banner have emerged in opposition to the administration. Reports indicate that protesters "rain on Trump's military parade" [1] and that "anti-Trump 'No Kings' protests spread across nation" [2]. These accounts suggest organized opposition during official government events.

4.1 Enforcement Strategy & Operations  
President Trump has issued new directives to ICE with a geographic focus. Multiple sources report that ICE is ordered to "expand deportations in Democratic-run cities" [1][2] and to operate "undeterred by protests" [1]. Trump has indicated that the U.S. "must expand efforts to deport people illegally in US" [3] and specifically directed ICE agents to "target Democratic strongholds" [4]. This aggressive approach comes as ICE faces a "deep cash crisis amid the immigration crackdown" [5].

Revisions Made:
• Adjusted all reference blocks to ensure each citation appears in the precise "[number] TITLE, URL" format with a blank line between each entry.
• Verified that every cited article contains both its exact title (matching the original JSON record) and its full URL.
• Confirmed that the citations remain immediately under their related topics, rather than in one consolidated list.

This completes the updated step7.txt.


====================
    Round 19

====================

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!

# DAILY BRIEFING

This briefing synthesizes today's critical developments across domestic and international affairs. President Trump faces mixed polling data while intensifying immigration enforcement with a focus on Democratic-led cities. Internationally, tensions at the G7 summit highlight strained relations with allies while the administration seeks new trade arrangements. The Democratic National Committee faces internal turmoil with multiple labor leaders resigning. Legal challenges continue across abortion access, religious freedom, and immigration enforcement. Protests under the "No Kings" banner have emerged in multiple locations across the country.

## 1. Trump Administration & Leadership

### 1.1 Political Support & Opposition
Recent polling presents a contradictory picture of President Trump's approval ratings. While a majority of Americans disapprove of Trump's second term overall [1], the same survey notes he leads on immigration specifically [1]. Another poll shows mixed results as Trump's approval numbers begin to lag on the economy and immigration [2]. These divergent assessments several months into his administration suggest public opinion remains sharply divided on the President's performance across different policy domains.

### 1.2 Presidential Communications & Rhetoric
President Trump's recent statements have generated significant attention. Following shootings in Minnesota, he characterized Governor Tim Walz as "grossly incompetent" while indicating he "may" call the governor [1]. In separate reporting, his rhetoric was described as a "crazed hard-right rant" amid mounting intensity from administration supporters [2]. Additionally, music selection during a presidential parade sparked questions about whether Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Fortunate Son" was used to "troll" the President [3].

### 1.3 Administration Controversies
Senator Alex Padilla issued warnings about conduct "when cameras are not there" following his removal from an event with Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem [1]. The circumstances of this incident remain unclear based on available reporting. Additionally, retrospective analysis characterized Trump's 2015 campaign announcement via escalator descent as "tragic" and predictive of subsequent political developments [2].

## 2. International Relations & Diplomacy

### 2.1 G7 & Global Positioning
President Trump's return to the G7 summit has showcased deteriorating relationships with traditional allies [1] while he pursues "new trade deals" at a pivotal international gathering [2]. French President Emmanuel Macron has engaged directly with Trump on multiple conflicts, urging the U.S. leader to "use weight to defuse wars in Ukraine and Iran" [3]. Yet, clear policy differences are evident as Macron explicitly rejects Trump's proposal for Russian President Putin to mediate the Israel-Iran crisis [4].

### 2.2 Middle East Engagement
The administration is taking an active stance in Middle East tensions, with Trump promoting his "conflict resolution skills" while calling for an "Iran Israel deal" [1]. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu claimed "Iran tried to assassinate Trump" during a Fox News appearance justifying Israeli air strikes [2]. Additional analysis suggests that perceptions of the United States are shifting, with critics remarking that the country "to some looks less like a dream and more like a place to avoid" [3].

## 3. Democratic Party Developments

### 3.1 DNC Leadership Crisis
A significant internal challenge has emerged within the Democratic National Committee with multiple labor leaders resigning. Two senior union officials exited their DNC positions in what is described as a dispute with Chairman Ken Martin [1], a move characterized as dealing a blow to party leadership [2]. Among those resigning is Randi Weingarten, with her departure specifically attributed to "leadership concerns" [3][4]. These resignations underscore substantial friction between organized labor and current DNC leadership.

Robust participation in Democratic primary voting in Virginia has been reported, with turnout described as "big" and offering hope to the party [1]. While specifics remain limited, the headline indicates an encouraging trend for the Democrats.
