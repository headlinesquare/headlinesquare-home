**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is June, 2025. The executive branch expanded their power dramatically, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025], and the tech czar Elon Musk [The founder and former head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)]. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. Later, Elon Musk left DOGE, but his influence continues. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I am ready.

I have thoroughly reviewed the background information, my role as Chief News Analyst for Congressional leadership, and the critical context of the current political situation in June 2025.

I understand that my primary objective is to produce a balanced, objective, and factually rigorous intelligence briefing derived solely from the provided news feed. I will strictly adhere to the constraints you have outlined, particularly regarding my outdated internal knowledge and the need to analyze and filter for potential bias from the source subreddit, r/politics.

I am prepared to execute the 8-step workflow as instructed, proceeding meticulously through each stage of analysis and composition.

Please provide the JSONL data. I am ready to begin Step 1.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    Round 2
    Assistant: 
====================

Based on a thorough review of the 87 provided news headlines, I have defined the following hierarchical categories to structure the daily briefing. The categories are designed to group related events and themes logically, providing a clear overview of the current political landscape for both Democratic and Republican leadership.

Area 1: U.S. Military Action in Iran
    Topic 1.1: The Military Strikes: Official Statements and Operational Details
    Topic 1.2: Congressional Reaction and Legal Debate
    Topic 1.3: Public and Political Base Reaction
    Topic 1.4: International Response and Geopolitical Context

Area 2: Domestic Policy and Legislation
    Topic 2.1: Republican Omnibus Legislation ("Megabill")
    Topic 2.2: Immigration and Border Security
    Topic 2.3: Healthcare and Education Policy
    Topic 2.4: Social, Economic, and Labor Issues

Area 3: U.S. Elections and Party Politics
    Topic 3.1: New York City Mayoral Election
    Topic 3.2: National Party Operations and Discourse

Area 4: Executive Branch and Presidential Conduct
    Topic 4.1: Executive Authority and Ethics
    Topic 4.2: Presidential Statements and Rhetoric

Area 5: Media and Social Commentary
    Topic 5.1: Analysis of the Political Climate and Media's Role
    Topic 5.2: Regional and Localized Issues


====================
    Round 3
    User: 
====================

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.


====================
    Round 3
    Assistant: 
====================

Upon careful review, I have refined the categories to better reflect the nuances within the provided news headlines and improve their cognitive organization. The primary changes focus on clarifying and specifying the topics within "Area 2: Domestic Policy and Legislation" to prevent overlap and create more distinct groupings. I also made a minor adjustment to the naming of a topic in Area 3 for greater precision.

The overall structure of 5 areas remains, as it effectively covers the breadth of the news feed. The hierarchy is maintained at two tiers (Area, Topic). The refined categories will allow for a more precise and logical sorting of the articles in the next step.

Here is the updated `step1.txt`:

Area 1: U.S. Military Action in Iran
    Topic 1.1: The Military Strikes: Official Statements and Operational Details
    Topic 1.2: Congressional Reaction and Legal Debate
    Topic 1.3: Public and Political Base Reaction
    Topic 1.4: International Response and Geopolitical Context

Area 2: Domestic Policy and Legislation
    Topic 2.1: Republican Omnibus Legislation ("Megabill")
    Topic 2.2: Immigration and Border Security
    Topic 2.3: Education, Healthcare, and Social Issues
    Topic 2.4: Economic and Fiscal Policy

Area 3: U.S. Elections and Party Politics
    Topic 3.1: New York City Mayoral Election
    Topic 3.2: National Party Strategy and Discourse

Area 4: Executive Branch and Presidential Conduct
    Topic 4.1: Executive Authority and Ethics
    Topic 4.2: Presidential Statements and Rhetoric

Area 5: Media and Social Commentary
    Topic 5.1: Analysis of the Political Climate and Media's Role
    Topic 5.2: Regional and Localized Issues

---
**Summary of Revisions:**

1.  **Refined Area 2 (Domestic Policy):** I restructured the topics within this area for greater clarity.
    *   The original "Topic 2.3: Healthcare and Education Policy" and "Topic 2.4: Social, Economic, and Labor Issues" had potential for overlap.
    *   I have revised these into **"Topic 2.3: Education, Healthcare, and Social Issues"**, which now appropriately groups articles on the Ten Commandments in schools, Supreme Court rulings on social issues (trans kids), and healthcare changes (ObamaCare).
    *   I created a more focused **"Topic 2.4: Economic and Fiscal Policy"** to specifically cover issues like trade, food aid funding, postal service vehicle sales, and the minimum wage/tax debate. This creates a clearer distinction between social policy and economic/fiscal policy.

2.  **Clarified Area 3 (Party Politics):**
    *   The original "Topic 3.2: National Party Operations and Discourse" was slightly vague.
    *   I have renamed it to **"Topic 3.2: National Party Strategy and Discourse"** to more accurately encompass topics like fundraising (strategy) and intra-party conflicts and media narratives (discourse).

These adjustments ensure that each headline has a more precise and logical placement, which will enhance the clarity of the final briefing. The other areas and topics remain unchanged as they were already well-defined and effective.


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 4
    Assistant: 
====================

I have categorized each of the 87 news articles, assigning each one to a unique Area and Topic based on the structure defined in Step 1. The articles remain in their original chronological order, as ranked by their ID.

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 5
    Assistant: 
====================

Upon review, I have confirmed that all 87 articles from the original feed were uniquely assigned to a category in the previous step. My initial categorizations proved to be sound, and no articles needed to be reclassified. The key was to ensure a consistent interpretation of each category's scope. For instance, articles describing the political fallout *within* a party were kept distinct from articles about the broader congressional debate, and international reactions were separated from the direct details of the U.S. military operation.

I have now sorted the categorized articles into the defined hierarchical structure. The following file, `step2_categorized.txt`, groups all 87 articles under their respective Areas and Topics, providing an organized view of the day's news.

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant: 
====================

After conducting a second, independent review of the categorization, I can confirm that the initial assignments are correct and logically sound. All 87 articles are accounted for, each is placed in only one category, and the hierarchical structure is complete.

My review focused on articles that could potentially fit into multiple categories. For instance, an article like `{"id": 61, "title": "Marjorie Taylor Green calls out AOC over Iran: 'Pathetic little hypocrite'"}` could be seen as part of the "Congressional Reaction" to the Iran strikes. However, its core subject is the political exchange between two lawmakers rather than a substantive policy or legal stance on the strikes themselves. Therefore, its placement in "National Party Strategy and Discourse" remains the most accurate fit. Similarly, articles blending a specific social issue with the "Megabill" were retained in the social issue category when that was the headline's primary focus.

No articles were found to be miscategorized or omitted. Therefore, no revisions were necessary. The file `step2_categorized.txt` remains unchanged from the previous step.

    Round 7

====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

I have completed the scoring process. Each article, topic, and area has been assigned an importance score from 1 to 10 based on a consistent set of criteria: source reliability, the significance of the event or information reported, and its immediate relevance to Congressional leadership.

The scoring framework prioritizes direct reporting of major events, official statements, and significant procedural actions over analysis, opinion, or localized news. The highest scores (9-10) are reserved for the most critical developments, such as the initial reports of military action, key procedural blocks to major legislation, and direct threats of further escalation by the President.

The resulting analysis is compiled below in `step3.txt`.

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

After careful re-evaluation of the importance scores, I have identified a few areas where the initial assessment could be refined to better reflect the direct impact on Congressional leadership and the legislative process. My revisions are focused on elevating the importance of key procedural developments concerning the Republican "Megabill" and adjusting the relative weights of different political areas.

**Summary of Revisions:**

1.  **Area 2: Domestic Policy and Legislation:** The importance of this area was increased from 8 to 9. This is to reflect that the procedural rulings against the "Megabill" are of paramount importance to legislative leaders, on par with major foreign policy and executive actions.
2.  **Topic 2.1: Republican Omnibus Legislation ("Megabill"):** The topic's importance was raised from 8 to 9. The report from the Senate Parliamentarian (`id: 60`), which comes from a primary-source-style domain (`budget.senate.gov`), represents a direct and significant obstacle to the majority's primary legislative vehicle. Its importance has been upgraded from 9 to 10. Similarly, the ruling on food aid cuts (`id: 27`) is a major development and has been raised from 8 to 9.
3.  **Area 3: U.S. Elections and Party Politics:** The importance of this area was decreased from 8 to 7. While containing significant data points (like party fundraising), its overall immediate actionability for leadership is slightly less than the direct legislative battles in Area 2.
4.  **Topic 4.1: Executive Authority and Ethics:** This topic's importance was increased from 8 to 9. This adjustment is driven by the gravity of the report in `id: 19`, which alleges a systemic undermining of government ethics laws—a matter of significant oversight concern for Congress.

These changes provide a more accurate hierarchy of threats and priorities, ensuring the briefing directs leadership's attention to the most critical developments across all fronts.
