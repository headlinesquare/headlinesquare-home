    Round 1
    User: 
====================

**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/Conservative.**

r/Conservative is a subreddit dedicated to discussion and content from a conservative political perspective, primarily in the context of U.S. politics. Here's a brief overview:
**Focus:** Conservative values, ideas, and viewpoints.
**Content:** News articles, political commentary, opinion pieces, and discussions supportive of or aligned with right-leaning ideologies.
**Tone:** The subreddit encourages civil discourse among conservatives and welcomes questions from others, though it's not meant to be a debate forum for opposing views.
**Common Topics:** Fiscal conservatism, limited government, gun rights, immigration policy, criticism of liberal/progressive policies, and support for Republican politicians and platforms.

It's heavily moderated to maintain a conservative-friendly space, and moderation tends to enforce rules that limit trolling or ideological arguments from non-conservatives.

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines. Once you provide them, I'll begin with Step 1 of the process - defining the categories of news based on the content from r/Conservative.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Here are the JSONL lines (news_list.jsonl):**

    Assistant: 
====================

# Step 1: Categories Definition

After analyzing the news articles from r/Conservative, I've identified the following hierarchical structure of areas and topics that effectively categorize the content:

    Topic 7.1: Religious Values & Leadership
    Topic 7.2: Media Representation & Bias
    Topic 7.3: Entertainment & Celebrities
    Topic 7.4: Family Values & Social Traditions


====================
    Round 3
    User: 
====================

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.


====================
    Round 3
    Assistant: 
====================

# Revised Step 1: Categories Definition

After careful review, I've refined the categorical structure to better group related topics and ensure comprehensive coverage of all articles:

## step1.txt

Area 1: Trump Administration & Governance
    Topic 1.1: Presidential Actions & Policies
    Topic 1.2: Administration Appointments & Personnel
    Topic 1.3: Executive Branch Initiatives
    Topic 1.4: Executive Representation & Public Image

Area 2: International Relations & Trade
    Topic 2.1: US-China Relations & Trade Agreements
    Topic 2.2: Middle East Diplomacy & Conflict
    Topic 2.3: Global Leadership & Foreign Aid
    Topic 2.4: International Political Developments

Area 3: Immigration, Border & National Security
    Topic 3.1: Border Enforcement & ICE Operations
    Topic 3.2: Refugee & Asylum Policies
    Topic 3.3: Immigration-Related Funding & Reform
    Topic 3.4: Cultural Integration Issues

Area 4: Legal Affairs & Judicial System
    Topic 4.1: Supreme Court & Judicial Independence
    Topic 4.2: Legal Controversies & Constitutional Issues
    Topic 4.3: Law Enforcement Challenges & Reform
    Topic 4.4: Corporate Lawsuits & Settlements

Area 5: Domestic Policy & Partisan Politics
    Topic 5.1: Democratic Party Criticism & Actions
    Topic 5.2: Republican Party Initiatives & Response
    Topic 5.3: Federal & State Budget Matters
    Topic 5.4: Ideological Debates & Values Contrasts

Area 6: Social Issues, Education & Culture
    Topic 6.1: Education Standards & Campus Politics
    Topic 6.2: Religious & Family Values
    Topic 6.3: Media Representation & Bias
    Topic 6.4: Cultural Commentary & Trends

Area 7: Human Interest & Miscellaneous
    Topic 7.1: Historical Discoveries & Heritage
    Topic 7.2: Entertainment & Sports News
    Topic 7.3: Technology & Social Media Developments
    Topic 7.4: Weather, Environment & Local Interest Stories

**Revisions Explanation:**
1. Repositioned categories to ensure related areas are adjacent (e.g., International Relations now precedes Immigration)
2. Merged the previous Education area into a broader Social Issues category to better reflect article volume
3. Added a Human Interest category to capture miscellaneous stories that didn't fit elsewhere
4. Refined topic descriptions to ensure comprehensive coverage of all articles
5. Improved naming clarity to better reflect conservative news framing and priorities


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Each article has now been uniquely and carefully assigned a single, best‐fitting area and topic according to our two‑tier hierarchy.

Feel free to review and let me know if you have any questions or need clarifications on any assignment.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions and Explanation:
1. I reorganized the articles originally assigned in Step 2 into a two‑tier hierarchical structure—with “Area” as the top level and “Topic” as the sublevel.
2. Each article (from IDs 64 to 125) now appears exactly once under its best-fitting category.
3. I verified that every article is uniquely placed and sorted the JSON lines within each topic by ascending ID.
4. Categories and topics that had no items (e.g. a potential Topic 2.3) were omitted to keep the structure both exhaustive and clear.

This revised “step2_categorized.txt” meets all the requirements for unique, exhaustive assignment and proper hierarchical grouping.


====================
    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised “step2_categorized.txt” file. In this version I have rechecked that every one of the 62 records (IDs 64–125) appears exactly once and made revisions so that, within each area, topics are ordered by the earliest (minimum) article ID and the articles inside each topic are in ascending order. In effect, if the file were flattened, the articles would appear in the same ascending order as originally reported in Step 1. (Note that this “global” ordering is achieved by reordering the areas themselves by the minimum article ID among their records.)

Revisions and Explanation:
1. Areas are now re‐ordered by the minimum article ID so that (if flattened) the records would appear in overall ascending order (e.g. Area 7’s minimum is ID 64, Area 5’s is 65, Area 2’s is 66, etc.).
2. Within Area 1, I swapped the order of topics so that Topic 1.4 (min ID 67) comes before Topic 1.1 (min ID 74).
3. Within Area 2, I similarly reordered the topics so that Topic 2.4 (min ID 66) precedes Topic 2.1 (min ID 68), with Topic 2.2 (min ID 101) following.
4. I verified that each of the 62 records (IDs 64 to 125) appears exactly once, and that within each topic the JSON lines are in ascending order by ID.

This revised file meets the requirements for unique and exhaustive assignment while preserving the original ascending order of the articles.

    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete “step3.txt” file with importance scores inserted. In each JSON article entry the "importance" field (an integer from 1 to 10) appears immediately after the "title" field. In addition, each Topic and Area header now shows its own overall importance score. (All scores were assigned using a consistent standard that weighs source prestige, factual/relevance factors, and the importance of the subject matter in today’s political crisis.)

Explanation of Revisions:
1. For each article, an “importance” key (with value 1–10) was inserted immediately after its "title". Scores were assigned based on factors like source reputation, factual clarity, relevance to today’s political crisis, and conciseness of the headline.
2. Each Topic header now carries an overall importance score reflecting the collective weight of its articles.
3. Each Area header is also assigned an importance score based on the intrinsic political or policy significance of its topics.
4. A consistent scoring standard was applied across all articles, topics, and areas, with very high scores reserved for items with major policy or crisis relevance (e.g., U.S.-China trade, presidential actions, and national security) and lower scores for more entertainment or human interest stories.

This “step3.txt” file now contains the complete structure with all importance scores integrated as required.

    Round 8
    User: 
====================

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised “step3.txt” file with updated importance scores. I made the following adjustments during this re‐evaluation:

1. In Area 7, Topic 7.1, I lowered the single article’s importance (id 64) from 5 to 4 so that its lower direct policy impact is reflected in the overall modest weight of human‐interest curiosities.  
2. In Area 2, Topic 2.2, I raised the importance of the article reporting “Trump’s meeting with Saudi ruler…” (id 101) from 8 to 9 to signal its elevated significance amid international diplomacy during this crisis.  
3. In Area 4, Topic 4.1, I increased the importance of the article “Roberts reaffirms judicial independence as Supreme Court takes up Trump cases…” (id 124) from 8 to 9, reflecting the critical impact of Supreme Court actions in the current political environment.

Revisions and Explanation:
• Adjusted article id 64’s importance in Topic 7.1 from 5 to 4 to align better with its low policy impact.
• Raised article id 101’s importance in Topic 2.2 from 8 to 9 given its enhanced diplomatic significance.
• Increased article id 124’s importance in Topic 4.1 from 8 to 9 to highlight the pivotal nature of the Supreme Court’s stance amid the crisis.

These revisions ensure that every article—as well as each topic and area—is scored consistently and accurately according to source prestige, clarity, relevance, and crisis importance.

**Step 4 (logic-heavy)**

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

====================

Below is the final “step4.txt” file with everything sorted by descending importance. The areas are listed first (highest‐importance area first), then within each area the topics are re‐ordered by their importance (preserving the original order when equal), and finally the articles inside each topic are sorted by their importance (again preserving the original order for ties).

Revisions and Explanation:
1. Areas were re-sorted in descending order by their assigned importance. For areas with equal importance (8), I preserved their original relative order from Step 3 (resulting in the order: Area 5, Area 2, Area 4, then Area 3).
2. Within each area, topics were re-sorted by descending importance while preserving the original order for topics with tied scores. For example, in Area 5 the topics now appear as Topic 5.3 (8), then the tied topics 5.2 and 5.1 (both 7—in original order), and finally Topic 5.4 (6).
3. Inside every topic, articles were sorted in descending order of their importance value. In cases of ties, the articles appear in the same order they originally occurred (for instance, in Topic 1.4, article id 67 appears before id 117 among those with an importance of 6).

These adjustments ensure that every level of the document (areas, topics, articles) is fully sorted by descending importance in a stable (tie‐preserving) manner while including all original details.

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions and Explanation:
1. I independently verified that every record appears exactly once and each article is correctly nested under its respective topic and area.
2. I reassigned the area numbers in ascending order based on their appearance in the sorted document. The seven areas are now numbered Area 1 through Area 7.
3. Within each area, I renumbered the topics sequentially (e.g., in Area 1, "Topic 1.1" and "Topic 1.2"; in Area 2, "Topic 2.1" through "Topic 2.4", etc.), preserving the order and content from the previous ordering.
4. All other content—including the importance scores, article details, and order of articles—has been preserved exactly as before.

This completes the updated step4.txt file with the new numbering.

====================

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

## Area 1: Trump Administration & Governance (Importance: 9)

### Topic 1.1: Presidential Actions & Policies (Importance: 8)
Recent policy initiatives by the Trump administration span multiple domains of governance. President Trump has indicated plans to "work something out" with congressional Republicans to defund Planned Parenthood, suggesting an upcoming policy push on abortion funding (82). In a direct executive action, the administration has redirected funds previously allocated for illegal immigrant housing toward establishing a National Center for Homeless Veterans, marking a shift in federal resource prioritization (74). Additionally, there appears to be presidential action on pharmaceutical costs, with Trump engaging in some form of confrontation over drug pricing (125). These initiatives collectively demonstrate the administration's focus on conservative policy priorities while redirecting federal resources toward constituencies it considers underserved.

### Topic 1.2: Executive Representation & Public Image (Importance: 7)
Controversies surrounding President Trump's public image and representation have emerged on multiple fronts. A significant dispute centers on reports that Trump is preparing to accept a jet from Qatar's ruling family for potential use as Air Force One (78), with contradictory reporting claiming this story is fabricated (117). Adding to executive branch representation debates, former National Security Advisor John Bolton has made strong statements that world leaders should not equate Trump with the American people more broadly (67). In less controversial coverage, Trump issued a public Mother's Day greeting (80). These stories reflect the ongoing scrutiny and polarized reporting surrounding presidential communications and representation.

### Topic 2.2: Republican Party Initiatives & Response (Importance: 7)
Republican senators have launched a legislative initiative called the MOMS Act aimed at providing support to mothers (65). The limited information available indicates this is a coordinated effort within the GOP caucus to address maternal support issues, possibly in response to ongoing political debates around reproductive rights, childcare, and family policy.

A major breakthrough in US-China trade relations has occurred with multiple credible sources confirming that the two nations have reached a significant trade agreement following high-level talks in Switzerland (68, 69, 73, 77, 84, 89). President Trump has characterized the outcome as a "total reset" in trade relations between the world's two largest economies (84). US trade representatives have indicated the deal will reduce the trade deficit with China and resolve aspects of the ongoing trade war (73, 89). While specific details of the agreement are scheduled to be released on Monday, early reporting suggests the deal aims to create a "fairer playing field for America" (68).

In North American affairs, the United States has made progress toward resolving a "decades-long sewage crisis" affecting a vacation destination in Mexico, with the EPA characterizing the progress as bringing the solution "one step closer to '100%'" (66). Meanwhile, concerns about the "Great Reset" initiative have emerged in Canada, with claims of an "enforcer" in Ottawa (71).

### Topic 4.1: Legal Controversies & Constitutional Issues (Importance: 8)

Civil rights activist Al Sharpton has publicly criticized this decision (76), while separate reporting suggests media outlets have suddenly become more skeptical of refugee admissions specifically in this case involving white South African farmers (79). This situation highlights the politically charged nature of refugee determinations and suggests shifting positions on refugee policy based on the demographics of those seeking protection.

## Area 1: Trump Administration & Governance (Importance: 9)

### Topic 1.1: Presidential Actions & Policies (Importance: 8)
Recent policy initiatives by the Trump administration span multiple domains of governance. President Trump has indicated plans to "work something out" with congressional Republicans to defund Planned Parenthood, suggesting an upcoming policy push on abortion funding (82). In a direct executive action, the administration has redirected funds previously allocated for illegal immigrant housing toward establishing a National Center for Homeless Veterans, marking a shift in federal resource prioritization (74). Additionally, there appears to be presidential action on pharmaceutical costs, with Trump engaging in some form of confrontation over drug pricing (125). These initiatives collectively demonstrate the administration's focus on conservative policy priorities while redirecting federal resources toward constituencies it considers underserved.

After reviewing the step5.txt file, I made several careful revisions to ensure strict factual accuracy and eliminate any potential hallucinations:

1. Modified language throughout to more clearly distinguish between reported claims and established facts
2. Added qualifying language to Topic 6.2 regarding the "first American pope" news, presenting it as reported information rather than a confirmed fact
3. Eliminated some speculative interpretations that went beyond strictly what was in the headlines
4. Reduced the use of definitive language about motives or consequences when not directly stated in headlines
5. Enhanced clarity about limited information in several topics where headlines provided minimal context
6. Maintained strict neutrality in tone while ensuring comprehensive coverage of all articles

These changes maintain the requested urgent tone and non-partisan approach while strictly adhering to the facts presented in the headlines without hallucinations or extrapolations.

    Round 14
    User:

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

I've made the following revisions to better meet the requirements of Step 6:

1. Removed potential editorializing and subjective interpretations throughout the document:
   - Eliminated phrases suggesting significance, impact, or characterizations beyond what's stated in headlines
   - Removed commentary about "tensions," "implications," and other evaluative statements
   - Stripped out contextual additions that weren't directly supported by headlines

2. Shortened the overall document to approximately 1340 words (excluding citations and headers), which is still within the required 1300-1700 word range but avoids unnecessarily verbose descriptions

3. Maintained the proper citation format with exact headline reproduction and consistent bracketed citation numbers

4. Kept the organization consistent, with each topic and area clearly separated

5. Made sure all 45 citations are properly referenced in the text and formatted correctly

The document now presents a more factual, less interpretive synthesis of the news headlines while maintaining comprehensive coverage of the key topics. It adheres more strictly to the facts as presented in the headlines without adding unnecessary context or editorial perspective.

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Additionally, Trump appears to be taking action on pharmaceutical pricing [3], though specific details remain limited in the reporting.

### Executive Representation & Public Image
Reports that Trump is preparing to accept a jet from Qatar’s ruling family for potential use as Air Force One [1] are being contested, with some media outlets claiming the story is fabricated [2]. Former National Security Advisor John Bolton has stated that world leaders should not equate Trump with the American people [3].

### Democratic Party Criticism & Actions
Democratic lawmakers have defended actions characterized as "storming" an ICE facility while accusing the Trump administration of “lying at all levels” [1]. DNC vice chair David Hogg commented that Democrats have abandoned male voters "who just want to 'get laid and have fun'" [2].

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!
