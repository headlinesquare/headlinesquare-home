## 1. Executive Power and Government Restructuring

### 1.1 Doge Activities and Efficiency Initiatives

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is expanding operations at state levels with Oklahoma's unit issuing a cuts report and Iowa holding its inaugural meeting [1]. Experts caution efficiency isn't solely about reducing spending. DOGE has removed AmeriCorps volunteers from disaster relief positions [2] and attempted to place staff within federally-funded nonprofits like the Vera Institute of Justice [3], indicating an expansive interpretation of its oversight mandate.
