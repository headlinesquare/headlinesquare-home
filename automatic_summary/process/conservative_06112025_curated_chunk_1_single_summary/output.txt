# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Civil Unrest and Crisis Management

### 1.1 Los Angeles Riots and Federal Response

Los Angeles has experienced significant civil unrest, triggering a federal‐state confrontation. President Trump provided evidence contradicting Governor Newsom's claim that "there wasn't even a voicemail" regarding communication during the crisis [1]. This breakdown highlights critical coordination failures between federal and state authorities. Polling indicates a majority of Americans approve of President Trump's National Guard deployment to address the riots [2], though the decision remains politically divisive. Nancy Pelosi characterized the deployment as "contra-constitutional," drawing comparisons to January 6th when she claims "we begged the president of the United States to send in the National Guard. He would not do it" [3]. Multiple conservative commentators assert the administration "did everything right" with the military deployment [4]. Texas has independently announced plans to deploy National Guard units across its state during protests [5].

Los Angeles Mayor Bass implemented an 8pm curfew in response to escalating unrest [6]. Pelosi's characterization of violence stemming from "exuberance of the moment" [7] has generated additional controversy about the causes of the disorder.

Federal courts have validated the government's authority to deploy military resources despite state opposition. A judge denied Governor Newsom's lawsuit seeking to order Trump to withdraw National Guard troops [8], and similarly rejected what was characterized as an "AntiTrump Motion" to block troops from entering Los Angeles [9].

### 1.2 Legal and Political Fallout

According to Washington Post reporting, some individuals arrested during the unrest have already been deported [10]. This expedited enforcement action represents a significant development in immigration policy implementation during civil disorder.

## 2. Government and Politics

### 2.1 Executive Actions and Policy Shifts

President Trump has announced the restoration of names for several military bases that were changed during the Biden administration [1].

### 2.2 Political Figures and Controversies

California gubernatorial candidate Steve Hilton has published a critique of Governor Newsom's response to the Los Angeles riots, questioning why the governor allegedly failed to act as unrest escalated [4].

Newsom has reportedly criticized the troop deployment, suggesting the resources could instead be used for "veteran nutrition assistance and housing" [6].

In international developments, Moscow has made claims about conditions for ending the war in Ukraine, specifically mentioning NATO withdrawal from Baltic states [7].

### 2.3 Electoral Developments

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has decided against pursuing what some observers characterized as an "easy Senate seat" in the 2026 election [8]. Political analysts continue assessing the electoral landscape, with some conservative commentators suggesting Democrats face significant challenges [9].

### 3.2 Inflation and Economic Indicators

Recent economic data indicates inflation increased slightly on an annual basis in May, though below market expectations [4].

### 6.2 Media Analysis and Technology
