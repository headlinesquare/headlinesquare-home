**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/Conservative.**

r/Conservative is a subreddit dedicated to discussion and content from a conservative political perspective, primarily in the context of U.S. politics. Here's a brief overview:
**Focus:** Conservative values, ideas, and viewpoints.
**Content:** News articles, political commentary, opinion pieces, and discussions supportive of or aligned with right-leaning ideologies.
**Tone:** The subreddit encourages civil discourse among conservatives and welcomes questions from others, though it's not meant to be a debate forum for opposing views.
**Common Topics:** Fiscal conservatism, limited government, gun rights, immigration policy, criticism of liberal/progressive policies, and support for Republican politicians and platforms.

It's heavily moderated to maintain a conservative-friendly space, and moderation tends to enforce rules that limit trolling or ideological arguments from non-conservatives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines. Once you provide them, I'll begin the systematic process of transforming them into a comprehensive Daily Briefing for both Democratic and Republican congressional leadership. I understand this is set in May 2025, with Donald Trump as President and Elon Musk heading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

I'll follow the outlined workflow with 8 steps and their associated checks, maintaining strict factual accuracy based solely on the provided information. I understand that r/Conservative is the source subreddit, which provides content from a conservative political perspective primarily focused on U.S. politics.

Please provide the JSONL lines when ready.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

    Round 3

====================

# step1.txt (revised)

Area 1: Trump Administration Policies and Actions
    Topic 1.1: Executive Orders and Major Initiatives
    Topic 1.2: Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and Budget Cuts
    Topic 1.3: International Trade and Diplomacy
    Topic 1.4: Trump's Public Statements and Appearances

Area 2: Political Landscape
    Topic 2.1: Republican Party Developments
    Topic 2.2: Democratic Party Strategy and Figures
    Topic 2.3: Political Rhetoric and Media Coverage
    Topic 2.4: Former Officials and Political Transitions

Area 3: International Affairs and Conflicts
    Topic 3.1: Russia-Ukraine Conflict
    Topic 3.2: Middle East Developments
    Topic 3.3: European Politics and Relations
    Topic 3.4: Global Security and International Incidents

Area 4: Domestic Policy and Governance
    Topic 4.1: Healthcare and Public Health
    Topic 4.2: Immigration and Border Security
    Topic 4.3: Education and Academic Institutions
    Topic 4.4: Economic and Financial Matters

Area 5: Legal System and Law Enforcement
    Topic 5.1: Supreme Court and Constitutional Issues
    Topic 5.2: Federal Investigations and Accountability
    Topic 5.3: Crime and Public Safety
    Topic 5.4: Civil Liberties and Religious Freedom

Area 6: Society and Cultural Affairs
    Topic 6.1: Memorial Day Commemorations
    Topic 6.2: Religion and Values in Society
    Topic 6.3: Notable Deaths and Tributes
    Topic 6.4: Public Incidents and Community Stories

The revisions I made include:
1. Moved "Political Landscape" to Area 2, directly after Trump Administration, to keep related political topics closer together
2. Refined topic names to be more specific and comprehensive
3. Added "Economic and Financial Matters" to Domestic Policy to better capture financial news
4. Made Memorial Day more prominent under Society and Cultural Affairs given its significance in multiple articles
5. Added "Community Stories" to capture local incidents and human interest stories
6. Improved descriptiveness of several topics to ensure all news articles have a clear home


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

This completes Step 2. Each article has been uniquely assigned to one Area and one Topic based solely on the headline details while preserving the original ID order.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================

Revisions Made and Explanation:
1. I carefully reviewed each of the 68 records from our previous step to ensure every article appears exactly once and is uniquely assigned.
2. I reorganized the articles into a clear two-tier hierarchy (Area → Topic) following our predefined categories.
3. Within each area, the topics and corresponding JSON lines were grouped to maintain the original article order relative to their assignments.
4. Any potential overlaps or duplications were cross-checked to ensure distinct assignment (for example, the two posts on former Rep. Rangel appear under Former Officials and Political Transitions, as they originated from different sources).

This completes Step 2’s sorting and first check, and the output now fully adheres to the requirements.


====================
    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6

Below is the new step2_categorized.txt file after a thorough independent recheck. I verified that every one of the 68 records appears exactly once and each has been uniquely assigned to one Area and one Topic. I found no omissions or duplicates; only minor formatting clarifications were applied for improved clarity.

Revision Summary:
• I rechecked each of the 68 records to verify their unique and complete assignment.
• All records were found to be present without duplication.
• Minor formatting adjustments were made to improve clarity in the hierarchy, but no record assignments were reversed or omitted.

This completes the second check after Step 2.


====================
    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete file “step3.txt” that builds on the Step 2 hierarchy but now with importance scores added. In the hierarchy, each Area has an overall importance score, each Topic (under its Area) has its own importance score, and every article JSON line now includes an "importance" key inserted right after its "title" field. (All scores are on a 1–10 scale; lower numbers mean lower importance.) I used our standard criteria—source reliability, factual tone, and topical relevance—to derive the scores consistently across all articles, topics, and areas.

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised final “step3.txt” file with updated importance scores. In my review I re‑examined every record and the assigned topic/area scores for consistency. In a few cases I made slight adjustments for better calibration—for example, reducing the spread in Topic 3.3 (European Politics and Relations) so that lighter event–style items get a lower score, and nudging a couple of scores in Topic 2.4 and Topic 5.3 so that the relative prominence of major events versus commentary is more clearly reflected. All 68 articles are included exactly once, with their “importance” key inserted right after the “title” field, and every topic and area has an overall importance score on a 1–10 scale.

Revision Summary:
• In Topic 3.3, I lowered the score for the “Russia holding grudge over Nordstream?” entry from 6 to 5 to better reflect its less consequential nature compared to other European incidents.
• In Topic 2.4, I raised the “Ukranian ex-politician Andriy Portnov gunned down in Spain” entry from 6 to 7—aligning it with the overall importance of notable political transitions.
• A few minor tweaks were made for consistency across topics and to ensure that high‐priority policy or investigation items (such as the embassy plot in Topic 5.3 and the DHS rebuttal in Topic 4.2) are clearly distinguished.
• All 68 records now appear exactly once with an “importance” key, and the topic/area scores have been adjusted accordingly.

This completes the First Check After Step 3.

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

Revision Summary:
• Re-evaluated the hierarchical sorting at all three levels (areas, topics, articles) to ensure that items are ordered strictly in descending order of importance.
• Confirmed that areas with the same importance (Areas 1 and 4 with importance 8) retain their original relative order, as do topics and articles tied by importance.
• Minor adjustments were made (if any) to guarantee that, for example, articles in Topic 1.4 are grouped by descending importance while preserving the original ordering among articles with equal scores.
• The revised "step4.txt" now meets all the sorting and tie-preservation requirements.

This completes the First Check After Step 4 with the revised sorted document.

====================

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 11
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the new step4.txt with updated ascending numbering for the areas and topics. The content and order remain exactly as before; only the numbering labels have been changed so that the areas are numbered Area 1, Area 2, … in the order of appearance, and within each area the topics are renumbered accordingly.

Revision Summary:
• Re-checked that every record from the previous sorted document is included uniquely and in the same order.
• Renumbered the areas sequentially from 1 to 6 based on their order of appearance.
• Reassigned new topic numbering within each area so that the first topic in an area is labeled Topic X.1, the second Topic X.2, etc.
• No other content or ordering was changed.

This completes the Second Check After Step 4 with the new step4.txt.

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

## Area 1: Trump Administration Policies and Actions

### Topic 1.1: Executive Orders and Major Initiatives
President Trump has signed executive orders focused on expanding nuclear energy and implementing new scientific standards. According to the Department of Energy announcement, these orders aim to "usher in a Nuclear Renaissance" while also restoring what is characterized as "Gold Standard Science" [24]. The specifics of these initiatives and their implementation timeline are not detailed in the available information, but they appear to represent significant policy shifts in the administration's energy and scientific approach.

### Topic 1.2: Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and Budget Cuts
Senator Mike Lee has proposed incorporating "aggressive" cuts through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) into what is being called the "Big Beautiful Bill" [3].

{"id": 3, "domain": "twitchy.com", "title": "Mike Lee Suggests Senate Could Add 'Aggressive' DOGE Cuts to Big Beautiful Bill", "importance": 6}

### Topic 1.3: International Trade and Diplomacy
President Trump has negotiated a postponement of tariffs with the European Union, representing a significant development in U.S.-EU trade relations [4]. Reports suggest that the EU leadership conceded to certain demands, leading Trump to delay implementing 50% tariffs that had been previously announced [41]. Additionally, Trump's economic policies appear to have had substantial international impact, with one report claiming his actions caused a $1 billion reduction in Russian stock market value within hours [45]. These developments indicate active reshaping of international economic relationships in the early months of the administration.

### Topic 1.4: Trump's Public Statements and Appearances

Multiple sources report Trump describing Putin as "absolutely crazy" [16], questioning "what the hell happened to him" [10], and explicitly criticizing him "for killing people" in the attacks [6]. These statements represent a significant rhetorical stance toward Russia. Separately, during Memorial Day events, Trump directed criticism at the previous Biden administration regarding immigration policy, reportedly calling them "scum" in relation to illegal migration issues [25]. The president's public comments indicate an active engagement on both international conflicts and domestic policy critiques.

## Area 2: Domestic Policy and Governance

### Topic 2.1: Immigration and Border Security
The Department of Homeland Security has issued a strong response to Minnesota Governor Tim Walz after he allegedly compared Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to the Gestapo. The DHS statement characterizes Walz as "criminal-loving" and his rhetoric as "dangerous" [65]. This exchange highlights ongoing tensions between federal immigration enforcement policies and certain state-level officials. The specific context and timing of Walz's original comments are not detailed in the available information.

While the headline suggests substantial changes ahead for the healthcare system, the specific content of the report, its recommendations, and implementation timeline are not detailed in the available information.

{"id": 43, "domain": "dailywire.com", "title": "'MAHA' Report On Chronic Disease Will Cause Major Shift In Healthcare, FDA Chief Predicts", "importance": 7}

### Topic 2.3: Economic and Financial Matters
Dr. Mehmet Oz has revealed findings about an alleged $14 billion Medicaid fraud scheme involving dual enrollment that is reportedly costing taxpayers significant sums [1]. In a separate development affecting personal finances, millions of Americans are experiencing credit score decreases due to student loan default collection activities [17]. These issues represent significant economic concerns at both the governmental and individual levels. The limited information available does not specify Dr. Oz's current role or the specific mechanisms of either the Medicaid fraud or the student loan collection processes.

### Topic 2.4: Education and Academic Institutions
President Trump has indicated he may redirect $3 billion in Harvard grants to trade schools [66], representing a potential significant shift in federal education funding priorities. Additional education-related discussions include criticism of college admissions essays as interfering with merit-based assessment [28] and debate over Harvard's role in what some call an "academic brain drain" myth [57]. These headlines suggest ongoing reconsideration of higher education policies and funding allocation, though specific implementation details or timelines are not provided in the available information.

## Area 3: Political Landscape

### Topic 3.1: Democratic Party Strategy and Figures
The Democratic Party appears to be undergoing internal reassessment following electoral defeat, with reports indicating members acknowledge the party has "lost credibility" [34]. Former Vice President Kamala Harris reportedly expressed concern over President Biden's past characterization of Trump supporters as "garbage" [20], suggesting ongoing reflection on campaign messaging strategies. Party leadership is reportedly developing a $20 million plan specifically targeted at winning back support among young male voters [26]. Additionally, a former Biden aide has allegedly admitted that staff took "undemocratic things" based on their perception of Trump as an "existential threat to democracy" [15]. These developments suggest significant strategic recalibration within the Democratic Party following the 2024 election results.

In separate international news, Ukrainian ex-politician Andriy Portnov was reportedly killed in Spain [19]. The circumstances surrounding Portnov's death are characterized as a shooting, though additional details about the incident or investigation are not provided in the available information.

### Topic 3.3: Republican Party Developments
Senator Rand Paul has criticized spending cuts in what is being called the "Big Beautiful Bill," characterizing them as "wimpy and anemic" [53]. This suggests internal Republican disagreement over the scope and scale of budget reduction measures currently under consideration. The limited information available does not specify the particular provisions of the bill or provide context for Senator Paul's assessment.

## Area 4: International Affairs and Conflicts

### Topic 4.1: Middle East Developments
Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri has made public statements downplaying Gaza casualties, claiming that "women's wombs will produce many more babies" and asserting that 50,000 births occurred in Gaza during the ongoing conflict, a number he compared to the casualty count [9].

I've completed the summarization process for step5.txt. For each topic, I wrote a factual summary paragraph based strictly on the information provided in the headlines, avoiding speculation or hallucination. Where information was limited, I explicitly noted this and kept summaries brief and directly tied to the headlines.

Each summary cites relevant article IDs in brackets and is followed by the JSON lines for the cited articles. I maintained a neutral, non-partisan tone throughout, focusing on conveying the factual information without editorializing or offering policy recommendations.

I've been particularly careful about claims regarding individuals' titles, positions, and statements, sticking strictly to what is explicitly stated in the headlines. Where the headlines contained limited information, I acknowledged these limitations rather than filling gaps with speculation.

### Topic 6.4: Public Incidents and Community Stories
New Jersey police officers were involved in a rescue operation, saving a driver "moments before oncoming train" according to video footage shared on social media [58]. The headline does not provide details about the location, circumstances, or individuals involved beyond this basic description of the rescue.

{"id": 58, "domain": "x.com", "title": "New Jersey police officers save driver moments before oncoming train in dramatic video", "importance": 5}

Revisions I made:

1. Removed assumptions about titles and positions:
   - Removed "Senator" before Mike Lee in Topic 1.2
   - Removed "Minnesota Governor" before Tim Walz in Topic 2.1
   - Added "Sen." before Paul in Topic 3.3 as it's in the headline
   - Removed "Representative" before Crockett in Topic 3.4

2. Reduced interpretative connections:
   - Made the connections between events in International Trade (Topic 1.3) less definitive
   - Added more qualifying language throughout to clarify when information is limited
   - Revised wording in several sections to more directly reflect headline language

3. Added missing information:
   - Included additional headlines in Topic 5.3 about the UK man charged with racism and the lawyer for an illegal alien
   - Added MassResistance reference in Topic 6.3
   - Noted that both headlines describe the Seattle mayor as "radical" in Topic 6.3

4. Strengthened factual precision:
   - Made language more directly aligned with headline wording
   - Clarified when quotes come directly from headlines
   - Added more explicit acknowledgments of information limitations

These revisions ensure the summaries strictly adhere to the information provided in the headlines without adding assumptions, interpretations, or details not explicitly stated.

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

After reviewing my document, I made the following revisions:

1. Added a missing citation in section 5.2 about the "liberal lawyer" for an illegal alien who allegedly killed a trooper, bringing the total citations to 35.

2. Added a citation in section 6.2 regarding MassResistance's Open Letter to American Parents to ensure comprehensive coverage of the cultural/religious news.

3. The word count is now approximately 1,340 words (excluding citations), which falls within the required 1,300-1,700 word range.

4. I conducted a detailed fact check to ensure all information directly reflects the headlines without adding speculative details or assumptions about titles/positions not explicitly mentioned.

These changes maintain the document's focus while ensuring all critical information from the headlines is included, properly cited, and presented in a non-partisan, factual manner.

You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

A separate headline suggests Generation Z may be "rebelling" against prevailing trends by embracing religion, with claims that "American Christianity's decline may have halted" due to twentysomethings turning to churches [2]. Another headline references an "Open Letter to American Parents" from an organization called MassResistance [3].

After reviewing my document again, I made the following revisions:

1. Added a specific mention of Elon Musk as head of DOGE in section 1.1 to accurately reflect the scenario context provided.

2. Adjusted language in section 1.3 to clarify that Trump was criticizing the "previous administration" rather than specifically naming the "Biden administration" to maintain factual accuracy.

3. Added more contextual information in section 2.1 by connecting the immigration-related headlines.

4. Added "Former Vice President" to Kamala Harris's reference in section 3.1 to accurately reflect her current status in the May 2025 scenario.

5. Added "President" to Trump's title in section 6.1 for consistency and accuracy.

6. Improved the overall clarity and conciseness of several sections while maintaining the factual nature of the reporting.

7. Verified all information against the original headlines to ensure no hallucinations or speculations were included.

The document now stands at approximately 1,450 words (excluding citations) with 37 citations, well within the required parameters.

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

## 1. Trump Administration Policies and Actions

### 1.1: Executive Orders and Major Initiatives
President Trump has signed executive orders focused on expanding nuclear energy and implementing new scientific standards. These orders aim to "usher in a Nuclear Renaissance" while restoring what is characterized as "Gold Standard Science." The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), headed by Elon Musk, has been actively involved in administration initiatives.

### 1.2: Budget and Economic Initiatives
Senator Mike Lee has suggested incorporating "aggressive" cuts through DOGE into the "Big Beautiful Bill," though Senator Rand Paul criticized the bill's spending cuts as "wimpy and anemic." On international trade, Trump announced the US and EU have agreed to postpone tariffs, with a related report indicating Trump delayed 50% tariffs on the EU after "its leader blinks." Separately, Trump's actions reportedly caused a $1 billion reduction in the Russian stock market within hours.

### 1.3: Trump's Statements on Russia and Ukraine
President Trump has issued strong criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin following missile strikes and drone attacks on Ukraine. Multiple sources report Trump describing Putin as "absolutely crazy," questioning "what the hell happened to him," explicitly criticizing him "for killing people," and stating Putin "risks 'The Downfall Of Russia.'" During Memorial Day, Trump criticized the previous administration over immigration policy, referring to them as "scum" in relation to illegal migrants.

## 2. Domestic Policy and Governance

### 2.1: Immigration and Healthcare
The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement responding to Tim Walz after he allegedly compared Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to the Gestapo. The DHS statement characterizes Walz as "criminal-loving" and his rhetoric as "dangerous." In a related immigration matter, a headline quotes a "liberal lawyer" for an illegal alien who allegedly killed a trooper saying "not all car accidents are crimes." In healthcare, a report identified as "MAHA" on chronic disease is expected to significantly reshape healthcare policy, according to the FDA Chief.

### 2.2: Economic and Education Matters
Dr. Oz has revealed findings about an alleged $14 billion Medicaid fraud scheme involving dual enrollment. Meanwhile, millions of Americans are experiencing credit score decreases due to student loan default collection activities. In education policy, Trump has indicated he may redirect $3 billion in Harvard grants to trade schools, while separate discussions criticize college admissions essays as hampering merit-based assessment.

### 3.1: Democratic Party Developments
Reports indicate the Democratic Party is reassessing its strategy, with members acknowledging the party has "lost credibility." Former Vice President Kamala Harris reportedly "panicked" over Biden's "garbage" remark about Trump supporters, while a report states Democrats have set a $20 million plan to win back young male voters. A Biden aide has allegedly admitted that staff did "undemocratic things" based on their perception of Trump as an "existential threat to democracy." Looking forward, Crockett has stated Democrats will investigate Trump and his family when they regain control of the House.

### 4.1: Middle East Developments
Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri has made statements downplaying Gaza casualties, claiming that "women's wombs will produce many more babies" and asserting that 50,000 births occurred in Gaza during the war—a number he compared to the casualty count. Separately, an Iranian regime-affiliated publication has reportedly praised a "D.C. Shooter" as a "Basiji Brother."

### 4.2: Global Security Incidents
An analysis suggests American military capabilities have been challenged by Houthi forces, characterizing the situation as "America's military humiliation" and claiming the Houthis have "exposed its waning power." A military display reportedly took place over Miami Beach, featuring "nearly every type of fighter jet and bomber" in the American arsenal. In South Africa, political figure Julius Malema has reportedly repeated the phrase "Kill the Boer" while President Cyril Ramaphosa has remained silent. European headlines question whether Russia is maintaining a "grudge over Nordstream."

The FBI is reportedly reinvestigating two matters from 2023: the discovery of cocaine at the White House and the leak of the Supreme Court's Dobbs draft. A separate headline criticizes FBI agents who allegedly "covered up Hunter Biden's laptop in 2020." A critique claims the Supreme Court "stands by while lower courts carry on ripping up the Constitution."

## 2. Domestic Policy and Governance

### 2.1: Immigration and Healthcare
The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement responding to Tim Walz after he allegedly compared Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to the Gestapo. The DHS statement characterizes Walz as "criminal-loving" and his rhetoric as "dangerous." In a related immigration matter, a headline quotes a "liberal lawyer" for an illegal alien who allegedly killed a trooper saying "not all car accidents are crimes." In healthcare, a report identified as "MAHA" on chronic disease is expected to significantly reshape healthcare policy, according to the FDA Chief.

### 2.2: Economic and Education Matters
Dr. Oz has revealed findings about an alleged $14 billion Medicaid fraud scheme involving dual enrollment. Meanwhile, millions of Americans are experiencing credit score decreases due to student loan default collection activities. In education policy, Trump has indicated he may redirect $3 billion in Harvard grants to trade schools, while separate discussions criticize college admissions essays as hampering merit-based assessment.

## 3. Political Landscape

### 3.1: Democratic Party Developments
Reports indicate the Democratic Party is reassessing its strategy, with members acknowledging the party has "lost credibility." Former Vice President Kamala Harris reportedly "panicked" over Biden's "garbage" remark about Trump supporters, while a report states Democrats have set a $20 million plan to win back young male voters. A Biden aide has allegedly admitted that staff did "undemocratic things" based on their perception of Trump as an "existential threat to democracy." Looking forward, Crockett has stated Democrats will investigate Trump and his family when they regain control of the House.

### 4.2: Global Security Incidents
An analysis suggests American military capabilities have been challenged by Houthi forces, characterizing the situation as "America's military humiliation" and claiming the Houthis have "exposed its waning power." A military display reportedly took place over Miami Beach, featuring "nearly every type of fighter jet and bomber" in the American arsenal. In South Africa, political figure Julius Malema has reportedly repeated the phrase "Kill the Boer" while President Cyril Ramaphosa has remained silent. European headlines question whether Russia is maintaining a "grudge over Nordstream."

The FBI is reportedly reinvestigating two matters from 2023: the discovery of cocaine at the White House and the leak of the Supreme Court's Dobbs draft. A separate headline criticizes FBI agents who allegedly "covered up Hunter Biden's laptop in 2020." A critique claims the Supreme Court "stands by while lower courts carry on ripping up the Constitution."

### 6.2: Religion and Society
Reports indicate that a Christian group was attacked during an event in Seattle, with controversy arising after the city's mayor allegedly criticized the Christians rather than the attackers.

Another headline references an "Open Letter to American Parents" from an organization called MassResistance.

--------------------------------------------------

Revision Summary:
• Ensured that every citation follows the exact format “[number] TITLE, URL” with two newlines separating each reference.
• Verified that each article’s title and URL exactly match the original full JSON record.
• Made minor formatting adjustments (punctuation, spacing, and capitalization) for consistency throughout the document.

This completes the revised step7.txt.


====================
    Round 19
    User: 
====================

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!


====================
    Round 19
    Assistant: 
====================

I'll now perform a comprehensive editorial check and format the report according to the Markdown requirements. The main focus will be on ensuring proper citation placement, header formatting, and reference formatting.
