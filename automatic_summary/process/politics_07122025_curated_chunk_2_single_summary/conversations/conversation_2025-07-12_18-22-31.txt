**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is July, 2025. The executive branch expanded their power dramatically, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025], and the tech czar Elon Musk [The founder and former head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)]. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. Later, Elon Musk left DOGE, but his influence continues. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

====================Input File End======================

---

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I am ready. I have fully reviewed and understand the provided background information, the political context of July 2025, my role as a bipartisan Chief News Analyst, the constraints on my knowledge, and the meticulous 8-step process for creating the Daily Briefing.

I await the JSONL news feed to begin Step 1.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    Round 2
    Assistant: 
====================

Based on a thorough analysis of the provided 79 news headlines, I have defined a hierarchical set of categories to organize the day's political events. The structure is designed to be comprehensive and cognitively intuitive for leadership in both parties, starting with the most immediate executive actions and controversies, then moving to major policy domains, other branches of government, and finally electoral politics.

Here is the finalized category structure.

Area 1: Executive Branch: Operations, Controversies, and Personnel
    Topic 1.1: Department of Justice & FBI: Epstein Case Fallout
    Topic 1.2: Presidential Rhetoric and Actions on Citizenship and Culture
    Topic 1.3: General Administration Controversies and Protests

Area 2: Immigration and Border Security
    Topic 2.1: DHS/ICE Enforcement, Detention, and Legal Challenges
    Topic 2.2: Immigration Policy and Legislative Proposals
    Topic 2.3: International Relations and Deportation

Area 3: Economic Policy
    Topic 3.1: Trade and Tariffs
    Topic 3.2: Domestic Economy, Inflation, and Federal Reserve Conflict

Area 4: Domestic Affairs
    Topic 4.1: Texas Floods and Federal Disaster Response
    Topic 4.2: Health and Science Policy
    Topic 4.3: Social Issues and Political Commentary

Area 5: Foreign Policy and National Security
    Topic 5.1: Ukraine Conflict and European Security (NATO)
    Topic 5.2: U.S. Foreign Relations and Incidents Abroad
    Topic 5.3: U.S. Military Affairs

Area 6: Judicial and Legislative Branches
    Topic 6.1: Supreme Court Dynamics
    Topic 6.2: Congressional Affairs and Bipartisanship

Area 7: Electoral Politics and Party Dynamics
    Topic 7.1: Future Election Speculation (2026/2028)
    Topic 7.2: Intra-Party and Inter-Party Tensions
    Topic 7.3: Local Elections and Candidate Scrutiny (NYC Mayoral)


====================
    Round 3
    User: 
====================

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.


====================
    Round 3
    Assistant: 
====================

After careful review, I have refined the category structure to better align with the specific content of the news headlines and to improve the logical flow and clarity. The revised structure is more precise and consolidates categories that were not sufficiently distinct or well-supported by the provided articles.

Here is the updated `step1.txt`.

***

Area 1: Executive Branch: Operations, Controversies, and Personnel
    Topic 1.1: Department of Justice & FBI: Epstein Case Fallout and Personnel Changes
    Topic 1.2: Presidential Actions and Rhetoric on Citizenship and Culture
    Topic 1.3: General Administration Controversies, Protests, and Internal Affairs

Area 2: Immigration and Border Security
    Topic 2.1: DHS/ICE Enforcement, Detention, and Legal Challenges
    Topic 2.2: Immigration Policy and Legislative Reform
    Topic 2.3: International Dimensions of Immigration

Area 3: Economic Policy
    Topic 3.1: International Trade and Tariffs
    Topic 3.2: Domestic Economy, Inflation, and the Federal Reserve

Area 4: Domestic Policy and Public Discourse
    Topic 4.1: Texas Floods: Federal Disaster Response and FEMA Scrutiny
    Topic 4.2: Health, Science, and Social Policy
    Topic 4.3: Political Rhetoric, Accusations, and Conspiracies

Area 5: Foreign Policy and National Security
    Topic 5.1: Ukraine War and European Security
    Topic 5.2: U.S. Foreign Relations and Incidents Abroad

Area 6: Legislative and Judicial Branches
    Topic 6.1: Congressional Affairs
    Topic 6.2: Supreme Court Dynamics

Area 7: U.S. Elections and Party Politics
    Topic 7.1: Speculation on Future Elections (2026/2028)
    Topic 7.2: Intra-Party and Inter-Party Dynamics
    Topic 7.3: New York City Mayoral Race

***

**Summary of Revisions:**

1.  **Refined Topic Names for Precision:** Several topic and area names were adjusted for greater accuracy.
    *   `Topic 1.1` was expanded to include "Personnel Changes" to encompass the firings at the DOJ.
    *   `Topic 1.2` was rephrased to "Presidential Actions and Rhetoric on Citizenship and Culture" to better capture both the citizenship threats and the Stonewall Monument news.
    *   `Topic 1.3` now includes "Internal Affairs" for a wider scope.
    *   `Area 4` was renamed to "Domestic Policy and Public Discourse" to more accurately reflect its contents, which include both concrete policy (floods, health) and abstract commentary.
    *   `Topic 4.1` was made more specific: "Texas Floods: Federal Disaster Response and FEMA Scrutiny."
    *   `Topic 4.2` was broadened slightly to "Health, Science, and Social Policy" to include the article on the Texas anti-abortion program.
    *   `Topic 4.3` was changed from the generic "Social Issues and Political Commentary" to the more descriptive "Political Rhetoric, Accusations, and Conspiracies" to reflect the nature of the headlines about MTG, Ann Coulter, etc.
    *   `Area 6` was reordered to "Legislative and Judicial Branches" to reflect their constitutional order.
    *   `Topic 7.2` was changed to "Intra-Party and Inter-Party Dynamics" from "Tensions" to include non-confrontational topics like endorsements.
    *   `Topic 7.3` was simplified to "New York City Mayoral Race."

2.  **Consolidated a Weak Category:** The original structure had a topic for "U.S. Military Affairs" (`Topic 5.3`) based on a single, speculative article about conscientious objectors. I have eliminated this topic to create a tighter structure. The sole article will now be categorized under `Topic 1.3: General Administration Controversies, Protests, and Internal Affairs`, as it represents a potential internal issue within the Department of Defense, an executive department. This improves the overall robustness of the framework.

These changes result in a more streamlined, logical, and accurately labeled set of categories that will serve as a strong foundation for organizing and summarizing the news in the subsequent steps.


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 4
    Assistant: 
====================

I have processed all 79 news articles, assigning each to the most appropriate category and topic from the structure created in Step 1. Each article is placed uniquely, and the original numerical order of the articles by their ID is maintained.

Here is the resulting `step2.txt` file.

    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 5
    Assistant: 
====================

I have completed the sorting and review process. Each of the 79 articles has been sorted into the hierarchical structure defined by the Areas and Topics created in Step 1. The article list has been checked for completeness and uniqueness, ensuring every article is covered exactly once.

Upon careful review, the initial categorizations assigned in the previous step were found to be logical and consistent. No re-classifications were necessary. The primary task in this step was to reorganize the flat, chronologically-ordered list into a thematically grouped hierarchy to facilitate structured analysis.

The following `step2_categorized.txt` file presents the final, sorted output.

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant: 
====================

Upon a second, independent review of the categorized and sorted articles, I have confirmed that all 79 records are accounted for, each appears only once, and their placement within the established thematic structure is sound.

No mistakes, omissions, or miscategorizations were found during this verification process. The Area and Topic for each article remain the most logical fit based on the headline's content.

Therefore, no revisions were made. The file `step2_categorized.txt` from the previous check remains correct and is presented below as the final output for this step.

    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Here is the scored and compiled file `step3.txt`. I have assigned an importance score from 1 to 10 to each article, topic, and area based on a consistent methodology considering source reliability, the significance of the reported action, and its potential impact on national policy and politics.

**Scoring Methodology:**

*   **Article Score (1-10):** Based on source prestige (e.g., Reuters, AP, NYT are high), factual reporting vs. opinion, and the significance of the actors and actions described (e.g., a Presidential decree is more important than a pundit's commentary).
*   **Topic Score (1-10):** A weighted assessment based on the number and importance of articles within the topic, as well as the inherent urgency and significance of the subject itself (e.g., a DOJ crisis is inherently more critical than election speculation).
*   **Area Score (1-10):** An aggregation of the topic scores, reflecting the overall news focus for the day.

The scores reflect a news cycle dominated by multiple, concurrent, high-stakes events across the Executive Branch, immigration, and economic policy.

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

After a careful re-evaluation of the scoring, I have made a few adjustments to enhance the internal consistency and accuracy of the importance ratings. The revisions are minor and primarily focus on distinguishing more clearly between breaking news, policy analysis, and routine political actions. The top-level importance scores for the major Areas remain unchanged, as the day's news is still overwhelmingly dominated by events related to the Executive Branch, Immigration, and Economic Policy.

Here are the specific revisions made:

1.  **Topic 2.1 (DHS/ICE Enforcement):**
    *   The importance of article `id: 131` ("LA Judge Orders ICE to Stop...") was decreased from 7 to 6. While the court order is significant, this report from `commondreams.org` (an advocacy journalism site) is slightly less impactful for briefing purposes than reports on the same event from more traditional news sources.
    *   The importance of article `id: 138` ("ICE handcuffs 71-year-old grandmother, a U.S. citizen...") was increased from 7 to 8. A report from a major source like NBC News detailing a specific, egregious enforcement action against a U.S. citizen carries a very high political and public relations impact.

2.  **Topic 2.2 (Immigration Policy and Legislative Reform):**
    *   The importance of article `id: 119` ("Slotkin Introduces New Legislation...") was decreased from 6 to 5. A single senator introducing a bill, while noteworthy, is a standard legislative process and has less immediate weight than the administration's concrete actions on funding and detention sites reported in the same topic.

3.  **Area 6 (Legislative and Judicial Branches):**
    *   The importance of article `id: 80` ("How some Supreme Court decisions fractured...") was decreased from 6 to 5. This article is a retrospective analysis of court dynamics, not a new ruling, making it slightly less urgent than breaking news.
    *   Consequently, the score for **Topic 6.2 (Supreme Court Dynamics)** was lowered from 5 to 4, as it contains only one moderately ranked article. The overall **Area 6** score remains a 3.

The updated file with these revisions is below.
