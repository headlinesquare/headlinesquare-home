    Round 1
    User: 
====================

**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is April, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines from the r/politics subreddit and begin the multi-step process of creating an objective Daily Briefing for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress. I understand the context is April 2025, with President Trump and Elon Musk (as DOGE head) expanding executive power.

I'll work through the 8 steps and associated checks methodically, analyzing the news items for importance, factual accuracy, and bias, while accounting for the generally progressive-leaning nature of r/politics. Please provide the news feed, and I'll begin with Step 1: defining categories for the news.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

6. Added specific topics for security threats and capital punishment to capture all articles
7. Reordered topics to ensure related categories are adjacent


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Each article appears exactly once with a unique Area/Topic assignment based on our defined two-tier hierarchy.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 5
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the final version of step2_categorized.txt. In this file every article (from IDs 1–92) appears exactly once, organized by the two-tier hierarchy (Area then Topic). Within each topic the articles are listed in ascending ID order (which preserves their original reporting order). After the file, a brief explanation follows regarding the revisions.

Revisions Made:
1. All 92 articles from the previous step have been rechecked for unique, exclusive assignment to one Area and one Topic.
2. The flat list from step2.txt was reorganized into a two-tier hierarchical structure by Area (e.g., Immigration and Border Policy, Economic Policy and Trade, etc.) and Topic (e.g., within Area 1: Deportation Actions, Border Security, etc.).
3. Within each Topic the articles are listed in ascending order by their ID to preserve the original reporting order.
4. Duplicate titles (or very similar headlines) were kept as separate records because each JSON line represents a unique record.

This completes the sorting and first check after Step 2.


====================
    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised step2_categorized.txt file. In this version I have rechecked every article (IDs 1–92) for unique, exclusive assignment and ensured that within each Topic the JSON lines are in ascending order by their IDs. No article is omitted or repeated across Areas/Topics (even if some headlines appear identical, their distinct IDs preserve uniqueness). Minor reordering was applied within topics where needed, and the Topics have been left in the sequence originally defined (by their numbering, not by article ID) to preserve our two-tier hierarchical structure.

Revisions and Explanations:
1. A thorough independent recheck confirmed that all 92 records (IDs 1–92) have been included exactly once in the hierarchy.
2. Within each Topic, the JSON lines are now strictly sorted in ascending order by their ID.
3. The Topics under each Area are listed following the original numbering from our initial assignment.
4. No article was omitted or mis-assigned; duplicate headlines (with distinct IDs) remain as separate entries.

This completes the second check after Step 2 with the final corrected step2_categorized.txt file.


====================
    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete step3.txt file with the importance scores inserted at every level. (Note: In the file below, every article’s JSON object now includes an "importance" field inserted immediately after "title". Likewise, each Topic and Area is annotated with an overall importance rating. All scores were assigned consistently according to source prestige, title clarity, relevance, and the cumulative weight of each grouping.)

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised step3.txt file with updated importance scores. The changes made after a careful re‐evaluation are as follows:

• In Area 3 (“Government Efficiency and Reform”), Topic 3.1 (“DOGE Activities and Leadership”) has been bumped from an overall importance of 6 to 7 given its heightened significance in the current power‐grab scenario.  
• Accordingly, within Topic 3.1 the article from AP News (id 36) has been increased from an importance of 7 to 8.  
• To reflect the greater weight of DOGE-related news, the overall importance for Area 3 has been adjusted upward from 6 to 7.  
• All other scores have been retained as originally assigned for consistency and balance.

**Step 4 (logic-heavy)**

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

**First Check After Step 4**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes and produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 10
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the updated step4.txt file after re‐evaluating and correcting the ordering. The primary revision was to fix the header for Topic 7.2 under Area 7 (“International Relations and Diplomacy”). In the original Step3 text the header for Topic 7.2 was given as importance 7 (even though its single article carried importance 6), so it must be sorted with the other topics of higher importance. The revised file now lists Topic 7.2 with importance 7 (and it now appears in the correct position among the topics). No other changes were necessary.

Explanation of Revisions:
• Revised the header for Topic 7.2 (“Middle East and Israel Relations”) from importance 6 to importance 7 so that it is consistent with its original label in Step 3 and sorted correctly alongside other topics.
• All other areas, topics, and article sort orders have been preserved by grouping items by descending importance and maintaining original order within tied groups.

This completes the updated Step 4 file.

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Explanation of Revisions:
1. I carefully re-checked that every record from the previous step was included exactly once and in the proper sorted position.
2. I reassigned new ascending numbering for areas and topics. The areas are now numbered Area 1 through Area 8 in the order they appear, and each topic’s numbering within its area has been updated sequentially (e.g., in Area 2, the topics are now numbered Topic 2.1, Topic 2.2, Topic 2.3, Topic 2.4).
3. All content—the titles, domains, article details, and importance scores—remains unchanged; only the numbering has been updated.

This completes the revised step4.txt file.

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

## Area 1: Immigration and Border Policy (importance: 8)

### Topic 1.1: Deportation Actions and Legal Challenges (importance: 8)
The Trump administration is facing significant legal challenges over its deportation policies, with several high-profile cases drawing attention. In one major incident, U.S. officials claimed a wrongfully deported man named Kilmar Abrego Garcia is "alive and secure" in an El Salvador prison (8, 9, 17, 44). The administration made this assertion to a judge after legal scrutiny over the deportation (17). Lawyers for Abrego Garcia subsequently asked a judge for a U.S. contempt hearing regarding the case (37). Simultaneously, reports emerged of a U.S. citizen receiving instructions from the Department of Homeland Security to "immediately self-deport" amid the broader immigration crackdown (3, 35). This email from DHS to people with temporary legal status has raised questions about who is actually affected by such directives (35). These cases highlight mounting tensions between the administration and courts, with some reports characterizing the administration's response to court orders as defiant (28).

### Topic 1.2: Border Security and Military Involvement (importance: 8)
President Trump has granted the military jurisdiction over federal land at the U.S.-Mexico border as part of his administration's border security strategy (26). This move represents a significant expansion of military authority in domestic border enforcement operations. Without additional reporting, the specific implications of this jurisdictional shift—including scope, duration, and operational parameters—remain unclear.

### Topic 1.3: Social Security and Immigration Enforcement (importance: 8)
The Trump administration has directed the Social Security Administration to classify more than 6,000 living immigrants as deceased in official records (1). This action appears to be part of a systematic effort to use Social Security as an immigration enforcement tool (71). The reclassification of living individuals as deceased could potentially affect their ability to access benefits, employment, banking services, and other aspects of daily life that rely on valid Social Security verification.

### Topic 1.4: Due Process and Civil Liberties for Immigrants (importance: 7)
Constitutional concerns are mounting regarding immigration enforcement tactics and their impact on due process rights. Reports indicate that a lawyer representing a pro-Palestinian protester was stopped and searched at the U.S. border, with authorities allegedly attempting to take the lawyer's electronic device (34). This incident coincides with broader criticisms that the Trump administration's approach to immigration enforcement threatens fundamental due process protections (79). These actions have raised alarms about potential civil liberties violations at U.S. borders and within the immigration system.

## Area 2: Economic Policy and Trade (importance: 8)

### Topic 2.1: Tariffs Implementation and Adjustments (importance: 8)
The Trump administration's tariff policies have created significant economic disruption and uncertainty. After initially taking a hard stance, the administration has made adjustments, particularly for technology products (82, 32). Despite President Trump's promise of "no retreat on tariffs," he subsequently yielded on some measures (50). U.S. Commerce Secretary announced that exempted electronic products would come under separate tariffs (82). Business impacts are becoming apparent, with one Minnesota company seeing tariff costs on a shipment from China jump from $18,000 to $170,000 (74). Republican lawmakers are expressing concerns that the trade war could lead to political consequences (40), while economic experts warn of negative consequences, with one Iowa State economist stating, "We're all going to be poorer" (53). Analysts have also raised alarm about the potential for the tariff situation to increase the risk of a U.S. default (45).

### Topic 2.2: China Trade Relations (importance: 8)
U.S.-China trade tensions remain high despite some tactical adjustments to tariff policies. China has characterized the U.S. tariff exemptions as a "small step" toward correcting what Beijing considers a policy mistake (78). The trade relationship is complicated by evidence that China has been using Vietnam as a conduit to evade higher U.S. tariffs (22). This circumvention highlights the challenges in enforcing trade policies. Fact-checking has contradicted President Trump's claim that China made $1 trillion off U.S. trade in 2024 (73).

### Topic 2.3: Business and Consumer Economic Impacts (importance: 7)
Consumers and businesses are facing direct economic consequences from tariff policies. Despite exemptions for some electronics, Americans will still pay more for numerous products including certain electronics, clothing, and coffee under the current tariff structure (15). Economic analysts have expressed serious concerns about the potential consequences, with some characterizing the policies as "dangerous" and suggesting they could lead to significant economic damage (80). Younger Americans, particularly millennials who have already experienced economic instability, are reportedly not receptive to policies that could create more financial uncertainty (31). Some business owners who supported Trump are now struggling with the impact of tariffs on their operations (70).

### Topic 2.4: Market Reactions and Financial Analysis (importance: 7)
Market and public opinion data show mixed reactions to the administration's economic policies. A poll indicates most Americans believe Trump's tariffs primarily benefit wealthy individuals and corporations rather than average citizens (89). Meanwhile, financial analyst Scott Bessent appears to be playing a significant role in economic policy decisions, with reporting suggesting he believes the president is committed to his economic approach (54).

## Area 3: Executive Power and Constitutional Issues (importance: 8)

### Topic 3.1: Executive Orders and Authority Expansion (importance: 8)
The Trump administration's exercise of executive power has expanded into multiple domains, raising constitutional questions. The president's attacks on law firms have begun to discourage pro bono work on causes he opposes (42), showing the administration's influence beyond formal governance channels. Harvard professors have filed a lawsuit over Trump's review of $9 billion in funding (59), challenging the executive branch's authority over academic institutions. Concerns about due process have intensified with reports that the president has discussed the possibility of deporting citizens (52, 84), which would represent a significant expansion of deportation authority. Reporting suggests Trump's governance style relies heavily on instinct rather than traditional policy processes (67), though his "team of rivals" has apparently moderated some of his more extreme positions (72). Legal experts have noted there is no legal pathway to send U.S. citizens to Salvadoran prisons, despite reports suggesting the president supported such measures (13).

### Topic 3.2: Presidential Term Limits and Succession (importance: 7)
Comments from former Trump advisor Steve Bannon have sparked discussion about constitutional term limits. In an appearance on Bill Maher's program, Bannon claimed that "Trump is going to run for a third term" (5). This statement conflicts with the 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which limits presidents to two terms in office. Without additional context or statements from the administration, it remains unclear whether this represents Bannon's personal opinion or indicates actual strategic discussions within Trump's circle.

### Topic 3.3: Congressional Oversight and Impeachment Discussion (importance: 7)
Congressional responses to executive actions have escalated to include discussions of impeachment. According to reporting, some members of Congress have begun talking about impeachment as a potential response to the administration's actions (77). The article suggests these discussions are warranted, though without additional information, it's unclear which specific actions are motivating impeachment considerations or how widespread this sentiment is among lawmakers.

## Area 4: Government Efficiency and Reform (importance: 7)

### Topic 4.1: DOGE Activities and Leadership (importance: 7)
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, has experienced significant operational and leadership challenges. A judge has relaxed restrictions that previously limited DOGE's access to sensitive U.S. Treasury information (36), potentially expanding the department's oversight capabilities. Musk has dramatically reduced DOGE's annual savings target from $2 trillion to $150 billion (58), indicating a substantial scaling back of initial ambitions. Reports of confrontational tactics have emerged, with allegations that DOGE staff physically removed a Social Security worker from their desk (47). Tensions within the administration appear to be growing, with some Trump officials reportedly describing Musk as "the most irritating person" they've had to deal with (60).

### Topic 4.2: Federal-State Relations and Funding (importance: 6)
A memorandum has emerged proposing to allocate increased federal funding to states with higher birth rates (2). The document reportedly includes rankings of states according to their birth rates, which would determine their funding eligibility. Without additional details, the full implications of this policy for state budgets, demographics, and political dynamics remain unclear.

## Area 5: Public Health and Social Services (importance: 7)

### Topic 5.1: Health Agency Restructuring and Data Collection (importance: 7)
Budget cuts and reorganization at health agencies have disrupted critical data collection efforts. According to reporting, cuts enacted by RFK Jr. have halted data collection on abortion, cancer, HIV, and other health conditions (92). Former employees and outside experts have warned that these reductions leave the nation more vulnerable to health threats. In a specific example of staffing cuts, the CDC's cruise ship inspectors have been laid off during what is described as "a bad year for outbreaks" (4). Meanwhile, the White House has released statements about President Trump's personal health, with his physician stating he remains in "excellent health" (86, 87).

### Topic 5.2: Vaccine Policies and Disease Management (importance: 7)
Public health challenges are intensifying as measles cases rise amid controversy over vaccine policies. Reports indicate measles cases have reached 700, putting pressure on RFK Jr., who oversees health policy (55). An outgoing U.S. vaccine official has criticized RFK Jr. for giving families "false hope" regarding autism (48), highlighting tensions between the administration's health leadership and established medical consensus on vaccines and autism spectrum disorders.

### Topic 5.3: Indigenous and Underserved Communities Health (importance: 7)
Health initiatives targeting indigenous communities face implementation challenges after program cuts. RFK Jr. has expressed intentions to target chronic disease in U.S. tribes, but a key program designed to address these health disparities has reportedly been gutted (85). The article suggests a disconnect between stated policy goals for improving tribal health outcomes and the operational capacity to deliver these services after funding reductions.

### Topic 5.4: Emergency Response and Disaster Relief (importance: 6)
Disaster relief funding decisions have affected states recovering from natural disasters. The new head of FEMA has denied North Carolina's request to extend 100% federal reimbursement for damage caused by Hurricane Helene (46). This decision potentially impacts the state's recovery resources and budget, though without further details, the full financial implications for North Carolina remain unclear.

### Topic 7.3: Education and Religious Freedom Issues (importance: 6)
Multiple education policy conflicts are unfolding across various institutions. The Trump administration has been ordered by courts to unfreeze funding in a dispute with Maine over transgender students (64). Concerns have been raised about the administration's approach to universities potentially extending to target accreditors, described as "a huge cudgel" against higher education (20). Reports indicate the Army Enlisted Academy has restricted students from writing about women and minorities (81). In state-level developments, Utah state school board members have allegedly characterized Jefferson and Lincoln as "Marxists" (75), while in Arizona, secular groups are opposing plans for a Mormon seminary at a public high school (76).

## Area 8: Political Opposition and Public Response (importance: 6)

### Topic 8.1: Public Opinion Polls and Approval Ratings (importance: 7)
Recent polling data indicates declining public support for the administration. According to data analyst Nate Silver, President Trump has seen a "significant hit" to his approval rating since an event called "Liberation Day" (11). This decline is particularly pronounced among young people, whose approval of Trump has "quickly plummeted" (14). Analysis from The Hill characterizes the situation as "Trump's honeymoon is over" (68), suggesting the post-inauguration period of public goodwill has ended. Additionally, research indicates Congressional speeches have become less evidence-based over time, with an AI analysis finding a shift from terms like "science" and "statistics" toward language such as "fake news" and "mislead" since the 1970s (69).

### Topic 8.2: Protests and Demonstrations (importance: 7)
Religious observations have been characterized as having political dimensions. A New York Times article has framed Palm Sunday as "a protest not a procession" (66), suggesting a reinterpretation of the religious observance through a lens of political activism. Without additional context, it's unclear whether this characterization refers to specific Palm Sunday events in 2025 or represents a broader theological or political commentary.

The president and administration officials have maintained high visibility at entertainment events amid economic concerns. Following a week of market turmoil, President Trump and Cabinet members attended a UFC event (38), where he reportedly received a standing ovation (33). Elon Musk was expected to be part of what was described as a "star-studded cast" at the Florida UFC fights (21). In popular culture, Saturday Night Live portrayed Trump delivering an Easter message comparing the stock market to Jesus, saying it "died, then on the third day, it was risen" (30, 90), apparently referencing recent market volatility. Separately, a right-wing host has claimed Trump's golfing expenses are part of a deliberate political strategy (6), though the specific reasoning behind this assertion is not detailed.

## Area 1: Immigration and Border Policy (importance: 8)

### Topic 1.1: Deportation Actions and Legal Challenges (importance: 8)
The Trump administration is facing scrutiny over deportation cases, with officials stating that a wrongfully deported man named Kilmar Abrego Garcia is "alive and secure" in an El Salvador prison (8, 9, 17, 44). According to headlines, the administration has communicated this information to a judge (17). Lawyers for Abrego Garcia have subsequently asked a judge for a U.S. contempt hearing (37). In a separate incident, headlines report that a U.S. citizen received instructions from the Department of Homeland Security to "immediately self-deport" amid the broader immigration crackdown (3). This DHS email to people with temporary legal status has raised questions about its application and recipients (35). Some reports characterize the administration's approach to court orders regarding deportation cases as defiant (28).

    Round 14

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title; [2] [original ID: xx] title; [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to add a "\n\n" between  lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title; [2] [original ID: xx] title; [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to add a "\n\n" between  lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# Daily Briefing: April 2025

## 1. Immigration and Border Policy

### 1.1 Deportation Actions and Legal Challenges
The Trump administration faces scrutiny over deportation cases. Officials claim wrongfully deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia is "alive and detained" in El Salvador's prison system [1][2]. Lawyers for Abrego Garcia have requested a U.S. contempt hearing [3], while reports characterize the administration's approach to court orders as defiant [4]. Separately, a U.S. citizen reportedly received instructions from DHS to "immediately self-deport" [5], with questions raised about who the directive applies to and who received it [6].

### 1.2 Border Security and Social Security Enforcement
President Trump has given military jurisdiction over federal land at the U.S.-Mexico border [1]. Trump aides have directed the Social Security Administration to list more than 6,000 living immigrants as dead [2], effectively turning Social Security into an immigration enforcement tool [3]. The Guardian reports Trump's actions regarding immigrants threaten due process rights [4], with additional claims he is "musing about deporting citizens" [5]. A lawyer representing a pro-Palestinian protester was reportedly stopped and searched at the U.S. border [6].

### 2.2 China Trade Relations
China characterized U.S. tariff exemptions as a "small step" toward fixing what it considers a mistake [1]. Reports indicate China has used Vietnam to evade higher U.S. tariffs [2]. A poll shows most Americans believe Trump's tariffs primarily benefit wealthy individuals and corporations [3]. Politifact states Trump is wrong that China made $1 trillion off U.S. trade in 2024 [4]. The Guardian notes that "big tech gets a big tariff reprieve" [5].

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL; [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# Daily Briefing: April 2025

## 1. Immigration and Border Policy

### 1.1 Deportation Actions and Legal Challenges
The Trump administration faces scrutiny over deportation cases. Officials claim wrongfully deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia is "alive and detained" in El Salvador's prison system [1][2]. Lawyers for Abrego Garcia have requested a U.S. contempt hearing [3], while reports characterize the administration's approach to court orders as defiant [4]. Separately, a U.S. citizen reportedly received instructions from DHS to "immediately self-deport" [5], with questions raised about who the directive applies to and who received it [6].

### 1.2 Border Security and Social Security Enforcement
President Trump has given military jurisdiction over federal land at the U.S.-Mexico border [1]. Trump aides have directed the Social Security Administration to list more than 6,000 living immigrants as dead [2], effectively turning Social Security into an immigration enforcement tool [3]. The Guardian reports Trump's actions regarding immigrants threaten due process rights [4], with additional claims he is "musing about deporting citizens" [5]. A lawyer representing a pro-Palestinian protester was reportedly stopped and searched at the U.S. border [6].

## 2. Economic Policy and Trade

### 2.1 Tariffs Implementation and Impacts
After promising "no retreat on tariffs," Trump subsequently yielded on some measures [1]. The Commerce Secretary announced exempted electronic products will come under separate tariffs [2]. Americans will still pay more for electronics, clothes and coffee under the tariffs [3]. One Minnesota company saw tariff costs jump from $18,000 to $170,000 on a shipment from China [4]. Republican lawmakers fear political consequences [5], while an Iowa State economist warned: "We're all going to be poorer" [6]. The Atlantic characterized the situation as a "tariff disaster" with "no coming back" [7].

### 2.2 China Trade Relations
China characterized U.S. tariff exemptions as a "small step" toward fixing what it considers a mistake [1]. Reports indicate China has used Vietnam to evade higher U.S. tariffs [2]. A poll shows most Americans believe Trump's tariffs primarily benefit wealthy individuals and corporations [3]. Politifact states Trump is wrong that China made $1 trillion off U.S. trade in 2024 [4]. The Guardian notes that "big tech gets a big tariff reprieve" [5].

## 3. Executive Power and Constitutional Issues

### 3.1 Executive Actions and Challenges
Harvard professors have filed a lawsuit over Trump's review of $9 billion in funding [1]. The president's criticisms of law firms have reportedly discouraged pro bono work on causes he doesn't like [2].

# Daily Briefing: April 2025

## 1. Immigration and Border Policy

### 1.1 Deportation Actions and Legal Challenges
The Trump administration faces scrutiny over deportation cases. Officials claim wrongfully deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia is "alive and detained" in El Salvador's prison system [1][2]. Lawyers for Abrego Garcia have requested a U.S. contempt hearing [3], while reports characterize the administration's approach to court orders as defiant [4]. Separately, a U.S. citizen reportedly received instructions from DHS to "immediately self-deport" [5], with questions raised about who the directive applies to and who received it [6].

### 1.2 Border Security and Social Security Enforcement
President Trump has given military jurisdiction over federal land at the U.S.-Mexico border [1]. Trump aides have directed the Social Security Administration to list more than 6,000 living immigrants as dead [2], effectively turning Social Security into an immigration enforcement tool [3]. The Guardian reports Trump's actions regarding immigrants threaten due process rights [4], with additional claims he is "musing about deporting citizens" [5]. A lawyer representing a pro-Palestinian protester was reportedly stopped and searched at the U.S. border [6].

## 2. Economic Policy and Trade

### 2.1 Tariffs Implementation and Impacts
After promising "no retreat on tariffs," Trump subsequently yielded on some measures [1]. The Commerce Secretary announced exempted electronic products will come under separate tariffs [2]. Americans will still pay more for electronics, clothes and coffee under the tariffs [3]. One Minnesota company saw tariff costs jump from $18,000 to $170,000 on a shipment from China [4]. Republican lawmakers fear political consequences [5], while an Iowa State economist warned: "We're all going to be poorer" [6].

### 2.2 China Trade Relations
China characterized U.S. tariff exemptions as a "small step" toward fixing what it considers a mistake [1]. Reports indicate China has used Vietnam to evade higher U.S. tariffs [2]. A poll shows most Americans believe Trump's tariffs primarily benefit wealthy individuals and corporations [3]. Politifact states Trump is wrong that China made $1 trillion off U.S. trade in 2024 [4]. The Guardian notes that "big tech gets a big tariff reprieve" [5].

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!

Lawyers for Abrego Garcia have requested a U.S. contempt hearing [3], while reports characterize the administration's approach to court orders as defiant [4]. Separately, a U.S. citizen reportedly received instructions from DHS to "immediately self-deport" [5], with questions raised about who the directive applies to and who received it [6].

China characterized U.S. tariff exemptions as a "small step" toward fixing what it considers a mistake [1]. Reports indicate China has used Vietnam to evade higher U.S. tariffs [2]. A poll shows most Americans believe Trump's tariffs primarily benefit wealthy individuals and corporations [3]. Politifact states Trump is wrong that China made $1 trillion off U.S. trade in 2024 [4]. The Guardian notes that "big tech gets a big tariff reprieve" [5].
