**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch expanded their power dramatically, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025], and the tech czar Elon Musk [The founder and former head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)]. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. Now, Elon Musk is leaving his role as the head of DOGE, but his influence continues.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/Conservative.**

r/Conservative is a subreddit dedicated to discussion and content from a conservative political perspective, primarily in the context of U.S. politics. Here's a brief overview:
**Focus:** Conservative values, ideas, and viewpoints.
**Content:** News articles, political commentary, opinion pieces, and discussions supportive of or aligned with right-leaning ideologies.
**Tone:** The subreddit encourages civil discourse among conservatives and welcomes questions from others, though it's not meant to be a debate forum for opposing views.
**Common Topics:** Fiscal conservatism, limited government, gun rights, immigration policy, criticism of liberal/progressive policies, and support for Republican politicians and platforms.

It's heavily moderated to maintain a conservative-friendly space, and moderation tends to enforce rules that limit trolling or ideological arguments from non-conservatives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines. I understand the task completely:

1. I'll be creating a Daily Briefing for both Democratic and Republican congressional leadership based on news from r/Conservative
2. I'll work through the 8-step process methodically, with checks after each step
3. I'll maintain complete objectivity while analyzing the importance, factual accuracy, and bias of each headline
4. I'll rely strictly on the information provided in your prompts, recognizing that my internal knowledge is outdated
5. I'll be particularly careful about political figures' current titles and positions
6. I'll note when headlines lack sufficient detail for proper interpretation

Please provide the JSONL lines when you're ready.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    User: 
====================

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

Revisions made:
1. Reorganized categories to better reflect the articles, placing related areas closer together
2. Refined topic titles to ensure better coverage of all articles
3. Consolidated Trump policy topics for better coherence
4. Placed International Affairs closer to administration areas due to policy overlap
5. Improved clarity between Campus/Education issues and broader Cultural Discourse
6. Made topics more specific to ensure every article has a clear best-fitting category


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

────────────────────────────────────────────

Explanation of the process:
1. For each article I read its title and, when available, cues from the domain to determine the best-fitting area among the eight defined.
2. I then selected the most appropriate topic underneath that area so that every article is uniquely classified.
3. In cases where an article appeared ambiguous or “out-of-field” (for example, the human interest story in article 16), I placed it in the category that could best encompass the broader societal or cultural debate.

This completes Step 2. Let me know when you are ready to proceed to the next step.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 5
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the final version of step2_categorized.txt. Every news article is included exactly once under its assigned area and topic. The hierarchy is two tiers only – Area then Topic – with each article (in its original JSON line) listed underneath. Note that the articles remain in their original order within each topic only if they happened to fall that way, but here we’ve grouped them by category for clarity.

Revisions and Explanation:
1. All articles from the original Step 2 listings (IDs 1–56) have been re-grouped into the eight defined Areas and then into their corresponding Topics.
2. Each JSON line now appears exactly once under its unique topic.
3. Articles were re–checked to ensure their assignment fits the article title and source cues; for instance, duplicate headlines from notthebee.com (IDs 30 and 47) were both listed separately under Mental Fitness Concerns.
4. Unused topics (those with no articles) were omitted from the final document.
5. The two-tier hierarchy (Area then Topic) is maintained without the original header labels, as requested.

This completes the categorization and sorting check after Step 2.


====================
    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant:

Below is the updated, final version of step2_categorized.txt. I have rechecked every record to ensure that all 56 unique articles are included exactly once under the appropriate area and topic. Minor adjustments were made to clarify placement and ensure no record was omitted or duplicated.

Revisions and Explanation:
1. I rechecked each article by its ID (from 1 to 56) to ensure that every record appears exactly once and no record was left out or duplicated.
2. I confirmed that all articles are uniquely placed according to their content cues and source domains.
3. The order of areas and topics has been maintained in the final grouping, with each article emerging only once under its proper classification.
4. No additional articles were discovered or reclassified in this second check; only confirmation and slight reordering for clarity were applied.

This completes the second check after Step 2.


====================
    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the final output file “step3.txt.” In this file each article’s JSON line now has an added field "importance" (placed immediately after "title") that reflects our evaluation of that item. In addition, each Topic header and each Area header now shows an overall importance score (also on a scale from 1 to 10) based on the collective significance of its articles. (Our scoring guidelines considered source reliability/prestige, factual/clear title, and topical relevance.)

This completes Step 3: Each article, topic, and area now carries an importance score reflecting our consistent evaluation criteria.

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised final version of step3.txt with updated importance scores. I have re‐reviewed each article’s rating based on source reliability, title clarity, and topical relevance and made the following revisions:

• In Area 1, Topic 1.1 (“Economic and Trade Initiatives”), I lowered the scores for the HotAir and AlphaNews articles from 6 to 5 to reflect their less‑prestigious sources.  
• In Area 1, Topic 1.2 (“Executive Authority and Legal Challenges”), I reduced id 4 (NewsNationNow) from 7 to 6 and id 7 (NY Post) from 5 to 4 so that the mix with the WSJ piece (id 13) more clearly averages to about 6.  
• In Area 4, Topic 4.2 (“Iran Nuclear Program”), I revised id 28’s score from 8 down to 7.  
• In Area 2, Topic 2.1 (“ICE Operations and Enforcement”), I reduced id 3 from 6 to 5 for consistency.  

All other scores remain as previously set. The topic importance scores were recalculated (rough averages of their articles) and the area importance scores remain consistent with the mix of topics therein.

Summary of revisions made:
1. Adjusted individual article scores in Area 1 (ids 8, 20, 4, 7) and Area 2 (id 3) to better reflect source reliability and title clarity.
2. Lowered id 28 in Area 4 from 8 to 7.
3. Recalculated the topic scores in Areas 1, 2, and 4 so their averages more accurately match the article ratings.

These changes ensure a more consistent application of our scoring criteria across all records, topics, and areas.

This completes the First Check After Step 3 with the updated step3.txt.

**Step 4 (logic-heavy)**

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

Below is the new finalized “step4.txt” file. In it, I have re‑evaluated the descending‐order sorting at every level—from areas to topics to articles—and made minor adjustments to ensure that:

• All areas are ranked in descending order by their “importance” value (with ties preserved in their original order from the Step 3 document).  
• Within each area, topics are sorted strictly by descending topic importance (again preserving the original order when importance values are tied).  
• Within each topic, articles are sorted by descending “importance” (and if articles share the same importance, their original sequence is maintained).

Revision Summary:
1. Areas are now strictly ordered in descending importance (all areas with importance 7—Area 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6—appear first in their original order, followed by areas with importance 6 in their original order, then the one with importance 5).
2. Within each area, topics are re‐ordered so that topics with higher importance appear first; ties maintain their original relative positions.
3. Within each topic, articles are sorted by descending importance, and for articles sharing the same importance value, the original order from Step 3 is preserved.

This completes the First Check After Step 4 with the updated “step4.txt.”


====================
    Round 11
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revision Summary:
1. Re-checked that every article from the previous version appears uniquely and exhaustively.
2. Re-assigned new ascending numbering to Areas based on their order of appearance (now Areas 1 through 8).
3. Within each Area, re-assigned new topic numbering in ascending order (e.g., Topic 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 in Area 1) while preserving the order and content exactly as before.

This completes the Second Check After Step 4 with the updated “step4.txt.”

    Round 12

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

Additional legal developments include reports that the Supreme Court previously overruled the judge in Trump's Harvard case [24], while Vice President J.D.

For Step 5, I've created summary paragraphs for each topic while:
1. Maintaining the original ordering from Step 4
2. Focusing strictly on information contained in the headlines
3. Noting when headlines lack sufficient detail rather than speculating
4. Citing article IDs for all claims and including JSON lines for referenced articles
5. Avoiding editorializing, policy recommendations, or partisan framing
6. Using appropriate length based on topic importance and complexity
7. Conducting fact-checking to prevent hallucinations by sticking only to what's explicitly stated in headlines


====================
    Round 13
    User: 
====================

**First Check After Step 5**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Now, produce the new step5.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    Round 14

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.
