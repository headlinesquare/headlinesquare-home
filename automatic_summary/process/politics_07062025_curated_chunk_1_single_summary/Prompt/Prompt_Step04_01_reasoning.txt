**Step 4 (logic-heavy)**

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!
