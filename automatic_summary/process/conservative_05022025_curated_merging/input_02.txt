# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Economy and Trade

### 1.1 Employment and Labor Market
The U.S. economy added 177,000 jobs in April 2025, exceeding market expectations despite ongoing tariff uncertainty [1]. This growth occurred alongside contradictory indicators, with reports noting a stalling labor market and shrinking GDP under the Trump administration [2]. Multiple sources confirm the 177,000 figure, with descriptions of the performance as "better than expected" and references to the economy "defying doomsayers" [3].

### 1.2 Economic Policy and Trade Relations
President Trump has renewed calls for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates following the April jobs report [1]. This request comes despite the better-than-expected employment data. Meanwhile, China appears to be experiencing pressure from the ongoing trade dispute, with reports of worker protests over unpaid wages and layoffs [2]. Chinese authorities have reportedly exempted approximately $40 billion worth of U.S. imports from tariffs [3], while analysis questions the viability of the administration's reciprocal trade negotiation strategy [4].
