Elon Musk's departure from DOGE has triggered significant political and legal repercussions [1][2][3].

Multiple whistleblowers have come forward with claims about procurement irregularities [8]. Congressional oversight committees have announced hearings on DOGE operations scheduled for next week [9].

### 1.2 DOJ Investigations

The Department of Justice has opened several investigations into potential conflicts of interest during Musk's tenure [1][2].

Both chambers are advancing hearings on potential reforms [6], though significant partisan divides remain over scope and enforcement mechanisms [7].

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has sought to reassure markets that efficiency initiatives will continue [7].

## 4. International Dimensions

Defense cooperation agreements established during Musk's tenure are being reviewed by partner nations [7].

## 5. Legal Challenges
