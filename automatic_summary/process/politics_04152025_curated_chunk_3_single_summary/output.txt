# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Authority and DOGE Operations

### 1.1 DOGE Data Collection and Cybersecurity Concerns
A whistleblower has alleged that Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team was responsible for a "significant cybersecurity breach" at the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), potentially compromising sensitive case files [1]. Following DOGE's access to NLRB systems, suspicious login attempts from a Russian IP address using DOGE's new accounts were detected [2]. The whistleblower who exposed this breach reportedly found threats taped to his door [3]. Meanwhile, DOGE has publicized claims about unemployment fraud that government agencies had already identified years prior [4]. DOGE is also reportedly accessing data from federal agencies to identify and remove immigrants from housing [5].

### 1.2 Government Restructuring and Personnel Changes
The Pentagon's specialized technology unit, described as a "SWAT team of nerds," has resigned en masse [1], with the program's director reportedly stating, "either we die quickly or we die slowly" [2]. This coincides with a leak probe affecting Pentagon leadership, with top Hegseth adviser Dan Caldwell placed on leave [3]. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is dismantling Pentagon programs designed to reduce civilian casualties, with his focus on "lethality" prompting warnings that this approach could lead to "wanton killing and wholesale destruction and disregard for law" [4]. In a separate development, President Trump plans to name a Hunter Biden whistleblower as acting IRS commissioner [5]. Some analysts suggest that "Phase Two" of administrative changes may have more severe impacts than initial DOGE initiatives [6].

### 1.3 Executive Orders and Press Relations
President Trump has signed a healthcare executive order that includes provisions favorable to pharmaceutical companies [1], while the administration supports Elon Musk's efforts to investigate alleged Social Security fraud despite reports indicating lack of evidence [2]. Regarding media access, the White House has implemented new restrictions following a legal victory by the Associated Press [3], though an AP reporter was subsequently permitted to attend a White House event [4]. The administration has also instructed Justice Department staff aligned with the MAGA movement to restrict their online communications [5].

A Colorado judge has implemented a temporary hold on deportations sought under the Alien Enemies Act [1].

The Trump administration is accelerating deportation efforts, with moves to expedite asylum cases without court hearings [4] and statements from President Trump expressing interest in deporting American citizens to El Salvador, with Trump quoted as saying "I Would Love to Do That" [5]. A federal judge blocked an attempt to strip deportation protections from approximately 500,000 immigrants, describing it as "unlawful action" [6].

The judge noted that the "Supreme Court has spoken" and criticized the administration for doing "nothing" to facilitate his return [3]. The court is considering contempt proceedings against the Trump administration [4].

Trump has threatened to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status [2]. Former President Obama has characterized Trump's freeze of Harvard funding as "unlawful" [3] and "ham-handed and illegal" [4]. While Harvard has taken a firm stance, Columbia University remains in negotiations regarding its federal funding [5]. Harvard Law faculty have characterized the administration's approach as a "page straight out of authoritarian playbooks" [6].

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has responded defiantly to threats regarding federal funding, stating "We're not going to negotiate with terrorists" regarding Trump's threats to withhold federal funds from the city [1].

The president's threat to impose tariffs on drug imports reportedly poses "big political risks" [4], while the administration has launched a probe into critical minerals that could lead to new tariffs [5]. The White House's negotiating approach using "shock and awe tariffs" faces challenges in finding a "first mover" for fast negotiations [6].

The Trump administration is evaluating significant changes to America's diplomatic footprint, with reports indicating plans to close nearly 30 overseas embassies and consulates [1]. US-Canada relations have taken an unusual turn, with a White House representative reiterating that "Trump believes Canada would 'benefit greatly' from becoming 51st state" [2]. Vice President JD Vance has expressed optimism about UK-US trade relations, indicating a "good chance" of a trade deal and noting that "Trump 'really loves' Britain" [3].
