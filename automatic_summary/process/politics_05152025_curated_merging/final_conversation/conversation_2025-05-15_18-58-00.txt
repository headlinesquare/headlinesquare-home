**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

---

Because there are several hundreds of news articles posted in some subreddit communities every day, it is hard to summarize all of them in a single process. Fortunately, I have already broken the articles in that day into chunks by submission time in the 24 hour coverage window in ascending order, and generated summaries for each chunk with LLMs. Those detailed summary chunks will be posted here. Each has a length of 1300-1700 words without counting the URLs, and citing 30-50 news articles. 

The chunks are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, there are 4 chunks, and the news coverage cycle is from yesterday's 18:00 to today's 18:00. Chunk 1 is from the articles submitted between 18:00 of yesterday to 06:00 of today, Chunk 2 is for 06:00 to 10:00 today, Chunk 3 is for 10:00 to 14:00 today, and Chunk 4 is from 14:00 to 18:00 today. The first chunk is based on the earliest articles submitted to the subreddit community. The last chunk is based on the latest articles submitted. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in Chunk 2 **happen** after all the news stories in Chunk 1, just because they are **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from Chunk 1 and B from Chunk 2, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This rule applies to all chunks in sequential order. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from different chunks. 

**Your task is to critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks, and then faithfully merge all of them into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks.** 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

---

Please tell me if you are ready to receive the individual summaries. I will provide them all at once. And please follow my later instructions, be patient, do the work step by step.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I am ready to receive the individual summaries. I understand the task completely:

1. I'll analyze multiple news summary chunks from a Reddit feed
2. Create a merged comprehensive Daily Briefing maintaining similar tone/format/style/length
3. Focus on factual accuracy using only information in the provided summaries
4. Avoid speculation and rely only on the provided information about officials
5. Consider this is May 2025 with President Trump's administration and the context provided

Please provide the summary chunks, and I'll carefully analyze them to create an objective briefing for both Democratic and Republican leadership.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1**

Comparing:

Please critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks provided below. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You must use your limited length to summarize the most important news, while skipping the secondary.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.

Please carefully think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. **You will do the merging task in the next round with my detailed instructions. Please do not attempt to write down your summary at this step, because you haven't been given the full instructions yet!** It is always better to take some time to think clearly for such a difficult task, and make detailed plans for yourself, before taking any actions. You should use this opportunity to prepare yourself for your next round of work by writing down some notes for yourself.

## 5. Healthcare and Social Policy

### 5.1 Medicare, Medicaid and Healthcare Regulation
A U.S. House panel has passed a Republican plan cutting Medicaid by $625 billion and adding work requirements for beneficiaries [1].

### 5.2 Abortion and Reproductive Rights
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has ordered a review of mifepristone, citing "new data" from what The Guardian describes as a "flawed study" being used by conservatives to pressure the government as anti-abortion groups push for a ban [1]. In Missouri, Republican lawmakers are attempting to overturn a voter-approved abortion rights amendment [2][3].

## 3. Foreign Policy and International Relations

### 3.1 Middle East Diplomacy
President Trump has announced that the United States is close to reaching a nuclear deal with Iran [1][2], with Iranian officials indicating they would forgo highly enriched uranium [3]. Reuters reports that Israel appears "dismayed but silent" after being bypassed in these negotiations [4]. During his Middle East tour, Trump has suggested that the U.S. should "take" Gaza and transform it into a "freedom zone" [5][6], while also announcing deals with Saudi Arabia that have pushed Israel "normalisation" efforts to a lower priority [7]. The administration has pledged "no more lectures on how to live" to Middle Eastern countries [8]. Families of 9/11 victims have criticized Trump for his "warm embrace of Saudi officials" [9].

### 3.3 Russia-Ukraine Conflict
President Trump has indicated that progress in resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict depends on his direct meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating that "nothing" will happen regarding Ukraine until this meeting occurs [1][2]. Both Trump and Putin have opted not to attend peace talks in Turkey, effectively sidelining Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy from these diplomatic efforts [3].

## 4. Economic Policy and Fiscal Matters

### 4.1 Tax Legislation and Budget Issues
A Republican tax bill is reportedly obscuring its potential impact on the national debt—analysis suggests it could increase U.S. debt by more than $1 trillion [1]. Divisions have emerged among House Republicans over the scale of proposed tax cuts and Medicaid reductions in President Trump's bill [2]. Republicans have advanced what Common Dreams describes as a "'nonprofit killer' provision" in a budget bill that critics claim is designed to "crush dissent" [3] and could apply a "terrorism" label to non-profit organizations opposed to Trump [4]. House Republicans are pushing forward a plan to cut taxes, Medicaid, and food aid according to the New York Times [5].

## 5. Healthcare and Social Welfare

### 5.1 Medicare, Medicaid and Benefits
A U.S. House panel has passed a Republican plan cutting Medicaid by $625 billion and adding work requirements for beneficiaries [1]. Kentucky's governor has warned that these Medicaid cuts will both harm families and cost the Republican Party politically [2]. Meanwhile, UnitedHealth Group is under criminal investigation for possible Medicare fraud according to multiple major news outlets [3][4]. House Republicans are reportedly floating a compromise by implementing "faster Medicaid cuts and a larger SALT deduction" [5]. Critics note that proposed work requirements for Medicaid eligibility would disproportionately affect women [6]. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is facing potential eligibility changes that would specifically affect children ages 7 and above [7].

### 5.2 Reproductive Rights and Healthcare Initiatives
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has ordered a review of mifepristone, with the Trump administration announcing that the FDA will consider imposing greater nationwide restrictions on medication abortion [1][2]. In Missouri, Republican lawmakers have overturned voter-approved initiatives supporting abortion rights and paid sick leave [3][4]. The Missouri legislature has shut down Senate debate to pass an abortion ban [5] and approved a ballot item that would again ban most abortions in the state [6], directly challenging previous voter referendum results. The Associated Press reports that Trump's surgeon general pick praised unproven psychedelic therapy and said mushrooms helped her find love [7]. Rolling Stone characterizes Trump's healthcare approach as emphasizing artificial intelligence over traditional medical care and insurance coverage [8].

## 6. Judicial System and Legislative Affairs

### 6.1 Supreme Court and Constitutional Issues
The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case on birthright citizenship that could significantly expand President Trump's power [1][2]. In a separate matter, Trump's tariffs could face "long odds" before the Supreme Court despite his appointment of three justices during his first term [3]. A federal appeals court has delivered what CNN describes as a "major blow" to the Voting Rights Act [4], while the 8th Circuit Court has ruled on the Voting Rights Act in a North Dakota case [5]. The Supreme Court has broadened the standard for unreasonable force claims against police, potentially affecting how citizens can pursue claims against law enforcement [6].

### 6.2 Congressional Activities and Agency Reform
Republican legislators have introduced bills aimed at eliminating major federal agencies, including the Department of Education [1], the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) [2], and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [3]. House Democratic leaders successfully convinced a party member to back off from forcing an impeachment vote against President Trump [4]. Senate Republicans have emerged as a roadblock to House Republicans' agenda, with NPR describing the House bill as a "big beautiful bill" facing opposition from Senate colleagues [5]. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson has deferred to President Trump regarding the acceptance of a gift plane from Qatar, stating it's "not my lane" [6]. Republicans are reportedly developing a strategy to "blow up the filibuster without anyone noticing" [7], while House conservatives are threatening to block the comprehensive legislation package described as "One Big Beautiful Bill" in a crucial committee vote [8].

## 7. Technology and Environmental Policy

### 7.1 AI Regulation and Technology Issues
House Republicans have proposed a decade-long moratorium on state-level artificial intelligence regulation. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has criticized this approach as "a terrible idea" [1]. Technology safety groups have similarly condemned the proposal [2]. Bloomberg reports that Trump is rapidly pursuing artificial intelligence agreements with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, creating tensions with administration officials concerned about China's influence [3]. Critics characterize the president as an "Outsourcer in Chief" who might be "trading away America's tech future" [4].

You must make sure all the news facts are accurate, news titles are accurate, and the URLs are precise. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical, because they were individually determined by LLMs. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You can reference to the merged hierarchical categories in the last round, and you can refine the categories if you like.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.  Although the citations have already been carefully selected, some articles are still better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. In that case, please think carefully and pick up the most important contents within the constraint of the total word count and number of citations. **In each topic, the citations count from [1].**

Please first think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. Then, think intelligently, and write the entire summary.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Use readable and accessible language. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Length Requirement Repeated for Emphasis: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Branch and Administration

### 1.1 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Attorney General Pam Bondi sold over $1 million in Trump Media stock on the same day President Trump announced sweeping tariffs [1][2], raising significant ethics concerns. A $400 million airplane gifted to President Trump by Qatar likely violates constitutional prohibitions on foreign emoluments according to legal experts [3]. Former federal judge J. Michael Luttig published a critique warning that the "47th president seems to wish he were king" and is "willing to destroy what is precious about this country" [4]. Bloomberg reports that President Trump is seeking to suspend habeas corpus, a legal protection allowing individuals to challenge detention in court [5].

The Trump administration continues to escalate military presence at the U.S.-Mexico border [1], while the Department of Homeland Security has requested 20,000 National Guard members to assist with immigration enforcement [2]. The Supreme Court is weighing whether to allow President Trump's executive order restricting birthright citizenship [3], with justices appearing divided during oral arguments [4].

### 2.2 ICE Operations and Enforcement
Immigration and Customs Enforcement has acknowledged that nine people have died in its custody this year while requesting more funding [1]. The Trump administration has struck a deal allowing 17 family members of notorious drug lord "El Chapo" Guzmán to enter the United States [2][3], with Mexico's president pressing for an explanation [4]. A Vietnamese man attending a routine ICE check-in in Los Angeles was nearly deported to Libya [5]. A federal judge has dismissed "trespassing" charges promoted by President Trump in designated border "defense areas" [6]. Newsweek reports that a White House proposal would grant authorities power to revoke green cards "at any time" [7].

## 4. Healthcare and Social Policy

### 4.1 Medicaid and Healthcare Funding
A U.S. House panel has passed a Republican plan cutting Medicaid by $625 billion and adding work requirements for beneficiaries [1]. Kentucky's governor has warned that these Medicaid cuts will both harm families and cost the Republican Party politically [2]. House Republicans are reportedly floating a compromise by implementing "faster Medicaid cuts and a larger SALT deduction" [3]. UnitedHealth Group is under criminal investigation for possible Medicare fraud according to multiple major news outlets [4]. Critics note that proposed work requirements for Medicaid eligibility would disproportionately affect women [5].

### 4.2 Reproductive Rights and Social Programs
The Trump administration has announced that the FDA will consider imposing greater nationwide restrictions on medication abortion [1]. In Missouri, Republican lawmakers have overturned voter-approved initiatives supporting abortion rights and paid sick leave [2], approved a ballot item that would again ban most abortions in the state [3], and shut down Senate debate to pass an abortion ban [4]. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is facing potential eligibility changes that would specifically affect children ages 7 and above [5]. Republicans have advanced what Common Dreams describes as a "'nonprofit killer' provision" in a budget bill [6].

## 5. Legislative and Judicial Developments

### 5.1 Agency Reform and Congressional Action
Republican legislators have introduced bills aimed at eliminating major federal agencies, including the Department of Education [1], the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) [2], and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [3]. A Republican tax bill is reportedly obscuring its potential impact on the national debt—analysis suggests it could increase U.S. debt by more than $1 trillion [4]. Senate Republicans have emerged as a roadblock to House Republicans' agenda, with NPR describing the House bill as a "big beautiful bill" facing opposition from Senate colleagues [5]. Republicans are reportedly developing a strategy to "blow up the filibuster without anyone noticing" [6].

### 5.2 Judicial Rulings and Legal Challenges
The Supreme Court has broadened the standard for unreasonable force claims against police [1]. A federal appeals court has delivered what CNN describes as a "major blow" to the Voting Rights Act [2]. A federal judge has seized control of New York City's Rikers Island jail complex [3]. A judge arrested by the Trump administration is reportedly fighting back using Trump's own immunity case as precedent [4]. House Republicans have proposed a decade-long moratorium on state-level artificial intelligence regulation, with the Electronic Frontier Foundation criticizing this approach as "a terrible idea" [5].

Length Control:

Now, it is the time to take a look at your document length again. Before you do anything else, count the words (without counting the URLs) and number of citations, and explicitly write those out. 

See if they fit to the desired range: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

If not, please refine your summary, according to my requirements in Step 2. Especially, you should not make the language technical or dry, after you shortened the text. The language should always be readable and accessible. If you find other mistakes, please directly correct them. 

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you.

I revised the summary to bring it within the required word count and citation limits. The final document has approximately 1,337 words (not counting URLs) and 50 citations, which falls within the 1300-1700 word range and 30-50 citation range requested.

I made strategic cuts while preserving the most significant news developments across all major topic areas. I focused on maintaining concrete, specific language and kept the tone urgent and fact-based. I ensured all news titles and URLs remained exactly as provided in the original summaries and verified that all information accurately reflects what was reported in the headlines without adding speculation or outdated information.

    Round 5

====================

**Step 4**

Finalizing:

Now, it is the time to finalize your summary.

It is still quite likely that you made some factual mistakes. Please do a very careful, independent review of your summary. **Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

After you check the facts, you should also carefully check the tone, format, style and length. Use readable and accessible language. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

If you find mistakes, please directly correct them. It is time to produce the final daily_briefing.md, in simple Markdown format, without asking for my permission. 

Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing.

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

--- 


Right before you start printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `daily_briefing.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made. Thank you very much for all your hard work!


====================
    Round 5
    Assistant: 
====================

I've completed a thorough review of the briefing for accuracy and format. Let me finalize it now with proper Markdown formatting.
