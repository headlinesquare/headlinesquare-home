## 3. Constitutional Issues and Judiciary

### 3.1 Supreme Court and Birthright Citizenship
The Supreme Court is weighing whether to allow President Trump's executive order restricting birthright citizenship to take effect while legal challenges proceed [1], with justices appearing divided during oral arguments [2]. Justice Amy Coney Barrett notably challenged a Trump administration lawyer about respecting court rulings [3]. Hundreds of protesters have gathered outside the Court calling on justices to protect birthright citizenship [4]. While the Court seems hesitant about the restrictions, reporting suggests justices may be prepared to limit nationwide injunctions that have blocked previous administration policies [5].

### 3.2 Constitutional Challenges

## 5. Foreign Relations and National Security

### 5.1 Middle East Diplomacy
During a visit to Qatar as ceasefire talks stalled, President Trump promoted his plan for a "freedom zone" in Gaza [1]. His broader Middle East tour has drawn criticism for allegedly sidelining Gaza issues in favor of closer ties with Israel's Netanyahu government [2], with reports highlighting "big deals" and discussions of "nuclear dust" as key components [3]. Families of 9/11 victims have criticized Trump for his "warm embrace of Saudi officials" [4]. Ben Cohen of Ben & Jerry's has publicly blamed U.S.-supplied weapons for what he termed a "genocide" in Gaza [5].

## 6. Healthcare and Social Welfare

### 6.1 Healthcare Policy Changes
Republican lawmakers are advancing changes to healthcare coverage. An analysis outlines "two basic ways" Republicans plan to cut health coverage [1], while House Republicans are reportedly floating a compromise by implementing "faster Medicaid cuts and a larger SALT deduction" [2]. President Trump's proposed "one big beautiful bill" would impact multiple programs including Medicaid and student loan forgiveness [3].

Scholars specializing in totalitarian fascism have issued warnings that "it is already worse and later than we think" regarding the current political climate [1]. The New York Times has published analyses of Democratic voters' concerns about Trump [2] and broader questions about how citizens might recognize when democracy has been compromised [3]. 

Republicans are reportedly developing a strategy to "blow up the filibuster without anyone noticing" [4], while House conservatives are threatening to block the comprehensive legislation package described as "One Big Beautiful Bill" in a crucial committee vote [5]. A California senator has called on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to restore its "billion-dollar" disaster database [6], while New York has joined a multi-state lawsuit against DHS over disaster relief funds being linked to immigration policies [7].
