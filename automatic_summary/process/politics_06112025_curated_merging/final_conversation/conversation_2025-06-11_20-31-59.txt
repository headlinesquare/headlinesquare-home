**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch expanded their power dramatically, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025], and the tech czar Elon Musk [The founder and former head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)]. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. Now, Elon Musk is leaving his role as the head of DOGE, but his influence continues.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

---

Because there are several hundreds of news articles posted in some subreddit communities every day, it is hard to summarize all of them in a single process. Fortunately, I have already broken the articles in that day into chunks by submission time in the 24 hour coverage window in ascending order, and generated summaries for each chunk with LLMs. Those detailed summary chunks will be posted here. Each has a length of 1300-1700 words without counting the URLs, and citing 30-50 news articles. 

The chunks are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, there are 4 chunks, and the news coverage cycle is from yesterday's 18:00 to today's 18:00. Chunk 1 is from the articles submitted between 18:00 of yesterday to 06:00 of today, Chunk 2 is for 06:00 to 10:00 today, Chunk 3 is for 10:00 to 14:00 today, and Chunk 4 is from 14:00 to 18:00 today. The first chunk is based on the earliest articles submitted to the subreddit community. The last chunk is based on the latest articles submitted. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in Chunk 2 **happen** after all the news stories in Chunk 1, just because they are **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from Chunk 1 and B from Chunk 2, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This rule applies to all chunks in sequential order. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from different chunks. 

**Your task is to critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks, and then faithfully merge all of them into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks.** 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

---

Please tell me if you are ready to receive the individual summaries. I will provide them all at once. And please follow my later instructions, be patient, do the work step by step.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the individual summary chunks. I understand that I need to analyze them carefully, paying close attention to factual accuracy based solely on the information provided. I'll merge them into a single comprehensive Daily Briefing that maintains neutrality while being useful to both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress. Please provide the summaries, and I'll work through them methodically.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1**

Comparing:

Please critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks provided below. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You must use your limited length to summarize the most important news, while skipping the secondary.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.

Please carefully think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. **You will do the merging task in the next round with my detailed instructions. Please do not attempt to write down your summary at this step, because you haven't been given the full instructions yet!** It is always better to take some time to think clearly for such a difficult task, and make detailed plans for yourself, before taking any actions. You should use this opportunity to prepare yourself for your next round of work by writing down some notes for yourself.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Immigration Enforcement and Policy

### 1.1 Legal Challenges to Immigration Enforcement

U.S. Representative LaMonica McIver has been indicted on federal charges stemming from an incident at a New Jersey immigration center [1]. She faces three specific charges related to a clash that occurred outside an ICE detention facility [2]. Trump's border czar has expressed concern that ongoing protests nationwide are making immigration raids more "difficult" and "dangerous" for ICE agents [3]. In a related development that reveals divisions within Congress, 75 Democratic lawmakers reportedly expressed "gratitude" to ICE in an antisemitism vote that occurred during the Los Angeles riots [4].

### 1.2 Public Response and Detention Policies

What began as localized protests in Los Angeles has evolved into a nationwide movement opposing immigration raids. Reports confirm demonstrations are now occurring in multiple cities across the United States [1]. The scale and geographic spread of these protests indicate a substantial public reaction to current immigration enforcement actions [2]. A specific case drawing significant attention involves asylum-seeker Andry Hernández Romero. Hundreds of protesters have gathered at the Supreme Court demanding that the Trump administration "return" the reportedly "disappeared gay asylum-seeker" Andry Hernández Romero [3]. According to reports, the Trump administration plans to send thousands of migrants to Guantanamo to "free up" space at detention facilities [4].

## 2. Federal-State Power Tensions

A significant legal development has occurred in the ongoing tension between federal and state authorities regarding control of National Guard forces. A judge has denied California's request to immediately block Trump's use of the National Guard [1]. This ruling represents a critical juncture in the dispute over military deployments within state borders during the current immigration enforcement operations and protests.

## 3. International Relations and Trade

### 3.1 US-China Trade Framework

A potentially significant development in U.S.-China relations has emerged with officials from both nations announcing consensus on implementing the Geneva Framework after talks in London [1]. The discussions, which extended into a second day, focused on advancing previously agreed-upon trade consensus points established in Geneva [2]. Neither headline provides specific details about the framework's provisions or potential economic impact.

### 3.2 Tariff Policy Legal Developments

The Trump administration has secured a legal victory regarding its tariff policies. A U.S. appeals court has ruled that Trump tariffs may remain in effect while appeals proceed through the judicial system [1]. This decision from the appellate level allows the current administration to maintain existing tariff policies despite ongoing legal challenges [2].

## 4. Los Angeles Protests and Federal Response

### 4.1 Military Deployment and Federal Intervention

President Trump has defended deploying military forces to Los Angeles during a Fort Bragg visit, with CNN describing his stance as "unrestrained" [1]. On the ground in Los Angeles, National Guard troops are specifically protecting ICE agents as they make arrests [2]. This deployment represents a direct connection between military forces and immigration enforcement operations, highlighting how federal authorities are coordinating different agencies and capabilities to maintain their enforcement activities despite public opposition. The New York Times has published an opinion piece titled "Trump's Flawed Message to Los Angeles" [3].

### 4.2 Treatment of Journalists During Protests

Serious concerns have emerged about journalist safety during the ongoing protests, with reporters being "shot and roughed up," leading advocates to question whether those covering protests are being specifically targeted [1]. The issue has taken on international dimensions with Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong condemning an "awful" police attack on an Australian reporter covering the LA protests, confirming that consulate help has been offered to the affected journalist [2].

## 5. Trump Administration Actions

### 5.1 Federal Agency and Military Policy Changes

President Trump has announced a significant organizational change, stating that FEMA will be wound down after hurricane season [1]. In military policy, Trump has ordered names restored to Army bases honoring Confederate leaders [2], with the Pentagon set to restore the names of 7 more Army bases that previously honored Confederate generals [3]. The decision reverses previous policy changes regarding military base designations that had been implemented to remove Confederate references from installations. The Atlantic has published an article titled "The Silence of the Generals" [4].

### 1.1 Middle East Tensions and Embassy Security
The United States is preparing to partially evacuate its embassy in Iraq due to regional security risks [1].

### 1.2 Defense Agreements and Military Alliances
The Pentagon has launched a review of the AUKUS defense agreement to assess its alignment with President Trump's "America First" agenda [1]. This evaluation of the trilateral security pact between the US, Australia, and the UK represents a potential recalibration of American commitments to international defense partnerships.

## 2. Domestic Security and Civil Unrest

### 2.1 Protests and Government Response
Protests that began in Los Angeles have spread to additional U.S. cities, creating a national pattern of civil unrest [1]. President Trump has stated he wants to "liberate" Los Angeles, a position that local residents reportedly oppose [2]. Tensions may intensify around Trump's planned military parade, as he has warned that protesters will face "very big force" without distinguishing between peaceful and violent demonstrators [3]. This approach to handling demonstrations raises concerns about potential escalation.  

Meanwhile, Speaker Mike Johnson has declined to elaborate on what he previously characterized as a "clear distinction" between the January 6th Capitol riot and current ICE protests, stating he won't "relitigate" the matter [4]. This reluctance to clarify his position comes amid ongoing public debate about different types of protest activities.

Merging:

Please faithfully merge all summary chunks into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks. 

Length Requirement: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

You must make sure all the news facts are accurate, news titles are accurate, and the URLs are precise. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical, because they were individually determined by LLMs. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You can reference to the merged hierarchical categories in the last round, and you can refine the categories if you like.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.  Although the citations have already been carefully selected, some articles are still better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. In that case, please think carefully and pick up the most important contents within the constraint of the total word count and number of citations. **In each topic, the citations count from [1].**

Please first think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. Then, think intelligently, and write the entire summary.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Use readable and accessible language. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Length Requirement Repeated for Emphasis: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

Length Control:

Now, it is the time to take a look at your document length again. Before you do anything else, count the words (without counting the URLs) and number of citations, and explicitly write those out. 

See if they fit to the desired range: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

If not, please refine your summary, according to my requirements in Step 2. Especially, you should not make the language technical or dry, after you shortened the text. The language should always be readable and accessible. If you find other mistakes, please directly correct them. 

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You should produce the new daily_briefing.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Immigration Enforcement and Civil Unrest

### 1.1 Immigration Operations and Federal Response

The Trump administration has intensified immigration enforcement nationwide, with ICE conducting raids across multiple states including California agricultural communities [1]. Immigration judges have been instructed to dismiss certain cases as part of a strategy to accelerate arrests [2]. The administration plans to send thousands of migrants to Guantanamo to "free up" space at detention facilities, according to reports [3].

Trump's border czar Tom Homan has expressed concern that ongoing protests are making immigration raids more "difficult" and "dangerous" for ICE agents [4]. National Guard troops are specifically protecting ICE agents as they make arrests in Los Angeles [5]. A specific case drawing significant attention involves asylum-seeker Andry Hernández Romero, with hundreds of protesters gathered at the Supreme Court demanding the Trump administration "return" the reportedly "disappeared gay asylum-seeker" [6].

### 1.2 Protests and Military Deployment

What began as localized protests in Los Angeles has evolved into a nationwide movement against immigration raids, with demonstrations now occurring in multiple cities across the United States [1]. President Trump has defended deploying military forces to Los Angeles during a Fort Bragg visit [2], and Marines are actively preparing for operations in the city [3]. A judge has denied California's request to immediately block Trump's use of the National Guard [4].

Los Angeles has implemented a curfew while California Governor Newsom has intensified criticism of President Trump [5]. President Trump has stated he wants to "liberate" Los Angeles, a position that local residents reportedly oppose [6].

### 1.3 Opposition Movements and Public Response

A growing opposition movement under the "No Kings" banner is gaining momentum, with Americans preparing for nationwide rallies described as a "Day of Defiance" [1]. Over 1,800 rallies are being organized under this slogan, directly responding to President Trump's threat to deploy "very heavy force" against demonstrators at Army parades [2]. USA Today reports that following events in Los Angeles, President Trump has advocated a position that would restrict protest rights primarily to his supporters [3].

**Step 4**

Finalizing:

Now, it is the time to finalize your summary.

It is still quite likely that you made some factual mistakes. Please do a very careful, independent review of your summary. **Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

After you check the facts, you should also carefully check the tone, format, style and length. Use readable and accessible language. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

If you find mistakes, please directly correct them. It is time to produce the final daily_briefing.md, in simple Markdown format, without asking for my permission. 

Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing.

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

--- 


Right before you start printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `daily_briefing.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made. Thank you very much for all your hard work!


====================
    Round 5

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Immigration Enforcement and Civil Unrest

### 1.1 Immigration Operations and Federal Response

The Trump administration has intensified immigration enforcement nationwide, with ICE conducting raids across multiple states including California agricultural communities [1]. Immigration judges have been instructed to dismiss certain cases as part of a strategy to accelerate arrests [2]. The administration plans to send thousands of migrants to Guantanamo to "free up" space at detention facilities, according to reports [3].

Trump's border czar Tom Homan has expressed concern that ongoing protests are making immigration raids more "difficult" and "dangerous" for ICE agents [4]. National Guard troops are specifically protecting ICE agents as they make arrests in Los Angeles [5]. A specific case drawing significant attention involves asylum-seeker Andry Hernández Romero, with hundreds of protesters gathered at the Supreme Court demanding the Trump administration "return" the reportedly "disappeared gay asylum-seeker" [6].

### 1.2 Protests and Military Deployment

What began as localized protests in Los Angeles has evolved into a nationwide movement against immigration raids, with demonstrations now occurring in multiple cities across the United States [1]. President Trump has defended deploying military forces to Los Angeles during a Fort Bragg visit [2], and Marines are actively preparing for operations in the city [3]. A judge has denied California's request to immediately block Trump's use of the National Guard [4].

Los Angeles has implemented a curfew while California Governor Newsom has intensified criticism of President Trump [5]. President Trump has stated he wants to "liberate" Los Angeles, a position that local residents reportedly oppose [6]. Concerns have emerged about journalist safety during the protests, with reporters being "shot and roughed up" [7].

### 1.3 Opposition Movements and Public Response

A growing opposition movement under the "No Kings" banner is gaining momentum, with Americans preparing for nationwide rallies described as a "Day of Defiance" [1]. Over 1,800 rallies are being organized under this slogan, directly responding to President Trump's threat to deploy "very heavy force" against demonstrators at Army parades [2]. USA Today reports that following events in Los Angeles, President Trump has advocated a position that would restrict protest rights primarily to his supporters [3].

The agreement reportedly includes provisions for China to supply rare earth minerals to the United States and for the U.S. to permit Chinese students [5]. However, Beijing has imposed a six-month limit on the easing of rare-earth export licenses [6]. Despite Trump's public claims, some reporting indicates no actual deal exists between the two nations [7].
