## 3. Immigration and Border Policies

### 3.1 Immigration Enforcement

The Trump administration has instructed immigration judges to dismiss certain cases as part of a strategy to accelerate arrests [1], representing a procedural change that could affect judicial independence within the immigration court system.

Democratic lawmakers have experienced backlash for a vote expressing gratitude to ICE [3], highlighting internal party tensions over immigration positions. In Los Angeles, ICE raids have reportedly driven both immigrants and citizens "underground" [4], suggesting widespread community impacts beyond undocumented populations.

President Trump has announced the completion of a trade deal with China [1], while simultaneously declaring that tariffs on Chinese goods will reach 55% [2]. The agreement reportedly includes provisions for China to supply rare earth minerals to the United States and for the U.S. to permit Chinese students [3].

A bipartisan minimum wage proposal has emerged with a Republican senator collaborating with a Democratic counterpart to advocate for a $15 per hour federal minimum wage that would include automatic annual increases tied to inflation [1].
