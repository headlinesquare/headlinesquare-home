**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the Reddit news feed JSONL lines and begin creating a comprehensive Daily Briefing to serve both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress. I understand that I'll be working with data from May 2025, analyzing news from the r/politics subreddit during a challenging period in American politics.

I'll follow the 8-step workflow you've outlined and remain mindful that factual accuracy is paramount. I recognize that my internal knowledge is outdated, and I'll rely solely on the information provided in the news headlines and the background context you've shared, without making unwarranted assumptions about political figures or events.

Please provide the JSONL lines, and I'll begin with Step 1: defining the categories of news.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# Step 1: Defining News Categories

After carefully analyzing the 75 news articles from r/politics, I've identified the following hierarchical structure of areas and topics that best organizes the news content. This categorization aims to facilitate human cognition by grouping similar topics together while ensuring comprehensive coverage of all major news areas.

```
Area 1: Trump Administration Policies
    Topic 1.1: Immigration Enforcement & Visa Issues
    Topic 1.2: Environmental & Energy Policy
    Topic 1.3: Healthcare & Social Services
    Topic 1.4: Foreign Student Policies
    Topic 1.5: LGBTQ+ & Gender Policies

Area 2: Economic & Financial Issues
    Topic 2.1: Taxation & Federal Budget
    Topic 2.2: Trade & Tariffs
    Topic 2.3: Housing & Infrastructure
    Topic 2.4: Cryptocurrency & Financial Markets

Area 3: Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)
    Topic 3.1: DOGE Authority & Access
    Topic 3.2: DOGE Leadership & Operations
    Topic 3.3: DOGE Controversies

Area 4: International Affairs
    Topic 4.1: US-Canada Relations
    Topic 4.2: US-Russia Relations
    Topic 4.3: Middle East Policy & Israel-Palestine
    Topic 4.4: International Trade Relations

Area 5: Legal & Judicial Matters
    Topic 5.1: Supreme Court Cases & Rulings
    Topic 5.2: Presidential Pardons
    Topic 5.3: Constitutional Challenges
    Topic 5.4: DOJ Actions & Law Enforcement

Area 6: US Electoral Politics
    Topic 6.1: Republican Party Dynamics
    Topic 6.2: Democratic Party Strategy
    Topic 6.3: Voter Registration & Election Administration
    Topic 6.4: Public Opinion & Polling

Area 7: Media & Political Commentary
    Topic 7.1: Trump Administration Criticism
    Topic 7.2: Media Coverage Analysis
    Topic 7.3: Political Figure Commentary
```

This structure encompasses all the major themes present in the news feed while maintaining a logical grouping that helps in understanding the relationships between different stories.

    Round 3

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

# Step 1: Defining News Categories (Revised)

After careful reconsideration, I've refined the categorization to ensure better cognitive organization and appropriate grouping of similar topics. I've also adjusted the number of areas to fall within the 5-8 range, combining some areas where appropriate.

```
Area 1: Trump Administration Domestic Policies
    Topic 1.1: Immigration & Deportation
    Topic 1.2: Student Visa & University Issues
    Topic 1.3: Environmental & Energy Policy
    Topic 1.4: Healthcare & Social Services
    Topic 1.5: Gender & LGBTQ+ Policies

Area 2: Economic & Financial Affairs
    Topic 2.1: Tax Legislation & "Big, Beautiful Bill"
    Topic 2.2: Trade Policy & Tariffs
    Topic 2.3: Housing & Infrastructure
    Topic 2.4: Cryptocurrency & Financial Markets
    Topic 2.5: Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Operations

Area 3: International Relations
    Topic 3.1: US-Canada Relations
    Topic 3.2: US-Russia Relations
    Topic 3.3: Middle East Policy & Israel-Palestine
    Topic 3.4: Global Trade & Foreign Affairs
    Topic 3.5: International Student Policies

Area 4: Legal & Judicial Matters
    Topic 4.1: Supreme Court Cases & Petitions
    Topic 4.2: Presidential Pardons & Executive Powers
    Topic 4.3: Constitutional Challenges
    Topic 4.4: DOJ Actions & Law Enforcement

Area 5: US Electoral Politics & Public Opinion
    Topic 5.1: Republican Party Dynamics
    Topic 5.2: Democratic Party Strategy
    Topic 5.3: Voter Registration & Election Administration
    Topic 5.4: Public Opinion Polling & Approval Ratings

Area 6: Political Commentary & Media
    Topic 6.1: Trump Administration Criticism
    Topic 6.2: Media Coverage & Analysis
    Topic 6.3: Political Figure Statements & Commentary
```

Revisions made:
1. Combined some areas to keep the total at 6 (within the 5-8 range)
2. Moved DOGE operations to Economic & Financial Affairs as it appears to have financial oversight roles
3. Consolidated immigration-related topics and student visa issues under one area
4. Placed international student policies with other international issues for better topical coherence
5. Combined electoral politics with public opinion polling for a more streamlined structure
6. Ensured similar categories remain grouped together (e.g., all international relations topics are together)
7. Added more specificity to certain topics (like "Big, Beautiful Bill" which appears in multiple headlines)

These revisions improve the cognitive organization while ensuring all articles can be properly categorized within the structure.


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Each article from IDs 1–75 has now been uniquely assigned to one two-tier category based on the headline’s content and context.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Below is the complete step2_categorized.txt file with the articles organized into a two‐tier hierarchy (Area and Topic) while preserving each article’s unique assignment. The JSON lines are listed in their original ascending order by id within each topic.

Revision Explanation:
• Reorganized the article assignments into a clear two-tier hierarchy (Area → Topic) rather than including both in a single header per line.
• Sorted the articles by area and then by topic, preserving each JSON line in its original ascending id order within each topic.
• Double-checked that each article appears exactly once and that no records are omitted.
• Removed redundant header information from each line to produce a cleaner hierarchy as requested.

This completes the sorted and revised step2_categorized.txt output.

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

• I verified that each article is uniquely assigned to one Area and one Topic, with no duplicates or omissions.
• The hierarchy now reflects a clear two-tier structure (Area → Topic), with articles remaining in their original ascending ID order within each topic.

This revised step2_categorized.txt file now fully meets the requirements.

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete final output for step3.txt. In this file I have inserted an "importance" field (with values on a 1–10 scale) into every article’s JSON line, and I have assigned an importance score for each topic and area based on the source reliability, headline clarity and relevance, and the overall weight of coverage on that issue. (Note: For Topic 3.5, no articles were assigned.) The scores were chosen using a consistent internal evaluation so that more prestigious sources and more concise, factual titles receive higher scores, while opinionated, sensational or less well‐known sources tend to receive lower scores. Use these scores as an approximate guide.

Below is the revised step3.txt with updated importance scores. After re-reviewing all records and our scoring rubric, I made one key revision: for Article ID 2 in Topic 2.1 (“Sen.

    Round 9
    User: 
====================

**Step 4 (logic-heavy)**

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

This completes the revised step4.txt.

Revisions Summary:
• Rechecked all area, topic, and article orderings to ensure descending sort by importance.
• In Topic 6.3, repositioned article ID 60 (importance 6) to appear first, ahead of all articles with importance 5, while preserving the original order for all tied articles.
• All other sections were confirmed to meet the sorting and tie-preservation requirements.


====================
    Round 11
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 11
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the updated step4.txt with new ascending numbering for areas and topics. I have also re‑checked that every record is present exactly once and in the same order as our previous sorted document. Only the numbering for the area and topic headings has been changed; the content and order of the articles remain unchanged.

This completes the revised step4.txt.

Revisions made:
• Re‑checked to ensure that every single record is uniquely included and all topics/areas are present.
• Re-assigned new ascending numbering for areas (Area 1, Area 2, …, Area 6) and, within each area, for topics (Topic 1.1, 1.2, …, etc.) based solely on their order of appearance.
• Preserved the original order and content of each article, merely updating the numbering to restore a sequential, ascending format.

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 12
    Assistant: 
====================

I'll create comprehensive summaries for each topic based on the news headlines, maintaining the original order and being extremely diligent about avoiding hallucinations. I'll focus on extracting factual information directly from the headlines while creating coherent narratives that connect related articles.

Let me work through each area and topic systematically:

────────────────────────────────────────────
# AREA 1: TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DOMESTIC POLICIES

## Topic 1.1: Student Visa & University Issues
The Trump administration has launched a significant crackdown on international students in the United States. The government has halted student visa appointments and implemented plans for expanded social media vetting of applicants [44]. Economic experts like Raghuram Rajan have warned that restricting foreign students threatens America's future competitiveness [43]. The administration is reportedly using "every tool" available to slow application processing, creating tensions with universities [65]. This policy has particularly affected international students at prestigious institutions like Harvard, where students describe feeling "used like pawns" in political maneuvering [36]. Israeli students specifically face potential expulsion from Harvard amid this wider crackdown [68]. Legal experts have criticized these actions, with some professors calling the measures targeting Harvard "blatantly illegal" [4]. As the standoff between the administration and universities deepens, affected students continue to face uncertainty about their academic futures in the United States.

## Topic 1.2: Immigration & Deportation
The Trump administration continues to pursue aggressive immigration enforcement policies while facing both resistance and implementation challenges. A particularly controversial case involves a critically ill four-year-old Mexican girl who has been ordered to leave the country despite medical experts warning she could die within days if deported [31]. Meanwhile, the administration is reportedly ramping up deportations, though still falling short of its targeted pace [56]. Senior officials like Stephen Miller and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem are demanding that ICE boost immigrant arrests [62]. At the local level, some institutions are cooperating with enforcement efforts, as evidenced by Santa Fe College approving an ICE agreement [30]. Contrasting with these federal enforcement actions, polling suggests that Californians continue to support providing pathways to citizenship for immigrants [42]. The confluence of these developments illustrates the complex and contentious nature of immigration policy implementation under the current administration.

{"id": 30, "domain": "wcjb.com", "title": "Santa Fe College approves ICE agreement", "importance": 4}

## Topic 1.3: Environmental & Energy Policy
President Trump has taken significant executive action on energy policy by signing orders designed to revitalize the U.S. nuclear power industry [16]. This move aligns with his administration's broader approach to energy independence and infrastructure development. Simultaneously, the Environmental Protection Agency is implementing new policies that critics claim will reverse decades of environmental protections [8]. While details about specific regulatory changes are limited in the available headlines, these actions suggest a continued emphasis on deregulation and energy production over environmental conservation priorities established in previous administrations.

## Topic 1.4: Healthcare & Social Services
Recent healthcare policy changes under the Trump administration have drawn criticism for potentially compromising patient care. Budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have reportedly delayed life-saving treatment for at least one cancer patient, prompting concerns about the politicization of healthcare access [74]. Beyond direct federal funding issues, research indicates that patients receiving emergency surgeries in private-equity hospitals face significantly higher mortality risks, with data showing a 42% increased likelihood of death within 30 days compared to patients at other facilities [34]. These developments highlight ongoing tensions in U.S. healthcare policy between fiscal considerations and patient outcomes.

{"id": 34, "domain": "marketwatch.com", "title": "Medicare patients getting emergency surgery in private-equity hospitals are 42% more likely to die in the next 30 days.", "importance": 7}

## Topic 1.5: Gender & LGBTQ+ Policies
The Trump administration's approach to gender-related policies represents a significant shift in federal governance. Analysis suggests that the administration's positions on gender issues extend beyond specific policy changes to reflect a broader challenge to the structure of government institutions themselves [14]. The available reporting characterizes these efforts as a "war on gender" with implications for how federal agencies operate and integrate gender considerations into their work. However, with limited headlines on this topic, a comprehensive understanding of specific policy changes and their implementation requires additional information.

{"id": 14, "domain": "newyorker.com", "title": "Donald Trump's War on Gender Is Also a War on Government", "importance": 8}

# AREA 2: ECONOMIC & FINANCIAL AFFAIRS

## Topic 2.1: Housing & Infrastructure
President Trump has announced that the federal government will maintain oversight and guarantees in the planned privatization of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac [41]. This approach suggests a hybrid model that aims to reduce government involvement in the housing finance market while preserving certain protections. The policy discussion occurs against a historical backdrop where, as one article notes, the U.S. government once directly built quality housing for working-class Americans during previous housing crises [32]. The contrast between current housing finance reform and historical federal housing initiatives highlights evolving approaches to government's role in addressing housing affordability and access.

## Topic 2.2: Tax Legislation & "Big, Beautiful Bill"
President Trump's major tax legislation, dubbed the "big, beautiful bill," has encountered unexpected resistance from Elon Musk, head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk has publicly expressed disappointment with the legislation [64, 73], claiming it undermines DOGE's mission to streamline government operations [35, 45]. This marks Musk's strongest rebuke of Trump's agenda to date [73]. The bill has also created divisions within Republican ranks, pitting Senate moderates against conservatives [51], with Senator Ron Johnson stating there are "enough" Republican votes to potentially block the legislation [2]. Implementation challenges are evident, as at least one Nebraska Representative admitted to voting for the bill without knowing its contents [71]. These fractures within the President's own party and administration highlight the political complexities surrounding this signature economic legislation.

## Topic 2.3: Trade Policy & Tariffs
The Trump administration's trade policies are facing increasing scrutiny for their economic impacts. Research indicates that Americans ultimately bear the cost of tariffs, contrary to earlier claims that foreign nations would primarily pay these fees [69]. In a notable policy reversal, President Trump has reportedly backed away from imposing tariffs on European Union goods, a move characterized by critics as "Trump Always Chickens Out" [70]. The administration's broader trade stance may be affecting tourism, as fewer international visitors are coming to the United States, with researchers warning this decline could result in "staggering" economic losses [66]. These developments highlight the complex economic considerations and potential unintended consequences of current trade policies.

{"id": 66, "domain": "cnbc.com", "title": "Fewer international tourists are visiting the U.S. — economic losses could be 'staggering,' researchers estimate", "importance": 7}

## Topic 2.4: Cryptocurrency & Financial Markets
The Trump administration is showing increased engagement with cryptocurrency markets. Trump Media has announced plans to raise $2.5 billion specifically to invest in bitcoin [46], signaling a significant corporate bet on digital currency. Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance is scheduled to speak at a Bitcoin event, further highlighting the administration's growing ties to the cryptocurrency sector [61]. These developments suggest an emerging intersection between the administration's business interests, political messaging, and cryptocurrency policy, though the specific regulatory approach to digital assets remains unclear from the available headlines.

{"id": 61, "domain": "cbsnews.com", "title": "JD Vance speaking at Bitcoin event today, as Trump administration's crypto ties grow", "importance": 6}

## Topic 2.5: Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Operations
A judicial ruling has granted the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, access to sensitive Treasury payment systems and data [22, 54, 67]. This decision represents a significant expansion of DOGE's oversight capabilities into core financial operations of the federal government. While the headlines do not provide details about the specific case arguments or the scope of this access, the ruling appears to enhance DOGE's ability to review and potentially influence Treasury operations. This development marks an important milestone in defining the authority and reach of this newly established department within the federal bureaucracy.

# AREA 3: INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS

## Topic 3.1: Middle East Policy & Israel-Palestine
The United States' Middle East policy is facing significant criticism, particularly regarding Gaza humanitarian efforts. A U.S.-Israel-backed humanitarian initiative has been condemned by the United Nations and aid groups following a deadly rush at an aid distribution site, which the UN described as "heartbreaking" [52]. Despite public defense of the initiative by both the U.S. and Israel, the incident has raised serious questions about the effectiveness and safety of current aid distribution mechanisms. Amid this crisis, President Trump is reportedly frustrated with the situation in Gaza but continues to allow Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to set the terms for conflict resolution [72]. This dynamic suggests tensions within the bilateral relationship despite strong public alignment on Israel's overall security approach.

{"id": 52, "domain": "aljazeera.com", "title": "UN, aid groups slam US-Israel-backed initiative after deadly rush in Gaza | UN says scenes at the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's aid site are 'heartbreaking' as US, Israel defend the initiative.", "importance": 8}
{"id": 72, "domain": "haaretz.com", "title": "Trump Is Frustrated, but He's Still Letting Netanyahu Set the Terms on Gaza", "importance": 8}

## Topic 3.2: US-Russia Relations
U.S.-Russia relations appear increasingly strained, with President Trump reportedly "losing patience" with Russian President Vladimir Putin while remaining uncertain about his next diplomatic approach [9]. This ambivalence comes as former President Biden has criticized Trump's handling of Russia as "modern-day appeasement" [49]. The headlines suggest evolving tensions in this critical bilateral relationship, though specific policy disagreements or incidents triggering Trump's reported frustration are not detailed in the available headlines.

{"id": 49, "domain": "theguardian.com", "title": "Biden accuses Trump of 'modern-day appeasement' towards Russia", "importance": 7}

## Topic 3.3: US-Canada Relations
U.S.-Canada relations are currently focused on discussions about a "Golden Dome" defense system, with President Trump stating it would cost Canada US$61 billion [5]. Trump has presented Canada with a stark choice, claiming the country would pay this significant sum for the defense system or nothing if it became the "51st state" of the United States [3]. Some reports go further, with Trump claiming that Canada is "considering" becoming a U.S. state in exchange for this protection [28, 55]. The exact nature of the "Golden Dome" system and its technical capabilities are not specified in the headlines, nor is there confirmation from Canadian officials about these discussions or the statehood consideration, which some outlets have characterized as a "wild claim" [55].

## Topic 3.4: Global Trade & Foreign Affairs
King Charles has reportedly sent a "firm message" to President Trump regarding values and free trade [50]. This suggests potential tensions between the British monarchy and the U.S. administration on trade policy principles. However, with just a single headline available on this matter, specific details about the King's message, its delivery context, or the Trump administration's response remain unclear. The interaction nonetheless indicates potential diplomatic engagement on trade policy between traditional allies.

{"id": 50, "domain": "inews.co.uk", "title": "King Charles sends firm message to Trump on 'values' and free trade", "importance": 6}

## Topic 3.5: International Student Policies
No articles were assigned to this topic, indicating insufficient specific information about international student policies distinct from the broader domestic issues covered in Topic 1.1. Without dedicated reporting on the international relations aspects of student policies, a comprehensive analysis of this dimension cannot be provided.

# AREA 4: LEGAL & JUDICIAL MATTERS

## Topic 4.1: Supreme Court Cases & Petitions
The Trump administration is actively pursuing changes to immigration enforcement through the Supreme Court, asking justices to lift limits on deportations to "third countries" [12, 26]. This would potentially allow the government to deport immigrants to nations where they have no existing ties. In a separate case with environmental implications, the Court has refused to hear an Apache tribe's plea to prevent copper mining at Oak Flat, a decision that could lead to the creation of a "massive crater" at the site. Justice Neil Gorsuch's dissent called this decision a "grave mistake" [19]. Additionally, President Trump has personally sought Supreme Court intervention on an unspecified matter [15], though the specific case details are not provided in the headline. These cases collectively demonstrate the administration's use of the judicial system to advance policy priorities while highlighting tensions around tribal sovereignty and environmental protection.

## Topic 4.2: Presidential Pardons & Executive Powers
President Trump plans to pardon reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley [6], exercising his constitutional clemency powers. This action comes amid a reported broader pattern of the Justice Department pulling back from public corruption cases [75]. While the headlines don't specify the Chrisleys' offenses or the reasoning behind this particular pardon, the juxtaposition suggests potential shifts in how the administration approaches justice and accountability in high-profile cases.

## Topic 4.3: Constitutional Challenges
President Trump's executive actions face significant constitutional scrutiny on multiple fronts. Questions have emerged about the constitutionality of his ban on gender-affirming care for transgender prisoners [10], potentially setting up legal challenges based on rights protections. In a separate case, a judge has strongly criticized a Trump order targeting a law firm as unconstitutional, invoking the founding fathers' intent in the rebuke [59]. These challenges highlight ongoing tensions between executive authority and constitutional constraints as the administration implements its policy agenda.

## Topic 4.4: DOJ Actions & Law Enforcement
The Department of Justice (DOJ) is pursuing varied and sometimes contradictory actions under the Trump administration. In the same day, the DOJ both charged a U.S. Representative for participating in an ICE protest and awarded $5 million to the family of a January 6 rioter [27]. The administration has also initiated legal action against North Carolina election officials over thousands of voter registrations [38]. At the legislative level, Representative Ritchie Torres has requested Capitol Police investigate a social media figure who allegedly encouraged support for a terror suspect [11]. These developments reveal complex and sometimes inconsistent approaches to law enforcement priorities and political expression.

# AREA 5: US ELECTORAL POLITICS & PUBLIC OPINION

## Topic 5.1: Democratic Party Strategy
Democratic politicians are actively preparing for future electoral contests, particularly the 2028 presidential race. Potential candidates are utilizing podcasts as platforms to reshape their public images [13], indicating evolving media strategies in political positioning. Meanwhile, activists who helped Democrats win control of the House in 2018 are reportedly taking on new, unspecified missions [47]. In more explicit presidential maneuvering, former Chicago Mayor and Obama administration official Rahm Emanuel is reportedly preparing for a presidential run [63]. On the legislative front, Senate Democrats have apparently identified a procedural tool to potentially block Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill" [53], suggesting continued resistance to the administration's economic agenda. These developments collectively demonstrate Democrats' multi-faceted approach to rebuilding influence while navigating the current Republican-controlled government.

## Topic 5.2: Public Opinion Polling & Approval Ratings
Recent polling suggests shifting public sentiment in American politics. The Economist reports that young voters played a significant role in President Trump's election victory [21], challenging traditional voting bloc assumptions. Other polling indicates Trump's approval rating has "soared" among Hispanic voters [18], potentially signaling demographic realignment. Broader party preference data shows Democrats falling behind Republicans in popularity [40], while general sentiment about the country's direction has reached a notable milestone, with 50% of Americans saying the nation is on the "right track" [39]. This collection of polling data suggests complex and evolving public opinion dynamics that may reshape political calculations for both parties.

# AREA 6: POLITICAL COMMENTARY & MEDIA

## Topic 6.1: Trump Administration Criticism
President Trump faces criticism for politicizing national events, with reports that a military parade is doubling as a birthday celebration for the President [58]. This has raised questions about the appropriate use of military resources for potential personal promotion. Meanwhile, opinion commentary from MSNBC characterizes Trump in harsh terms as "the stupidest and most cowardly president in American history" following an unspecified policy reversal [33]. These critiques reflect ongoing media scrutiny of the administration's decision-making processes and presidential conduct.

## Topic 6.2: Media Coverage & Analysis
Media figures continue to offer varied perspectives on both current and past administrations. Fox News commentator Brit Hume has publicly dismissed a recent statement by President Trump, saying he doesn't "know what" the President is talking about [7], suggesting skepticism even among traditionally conservative media outlets. In contrast, CNN's Jake Tapper has made controversial claims about the previous administration, suggesting that the alleged "cover-up" of President Biden's cognitive decline may have been "worse than Watergate" [20]. Meanwhile, analysis questions Trump's contentious relationship with news media organizations despite their role in his political rise [37]. These developments highlight ongoing tensions between political leaders and media institutions across the ideological spectrum.

## Topic 6.3: Political Figure Statements & Commentary
A diverse array of political figures have offered commentary on current affairs. Mary Trump, the president's niece, has expressed concern that her uncle has "never evolved, which is dangerous" [60]. In an unusual development, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and television personality Dr. Oz have offered to rescue ostriches reportedly facing death [24]. Critics have claimed that wealthy Republicans stand to personally benefit from policies that could reduce food assistance and healthcare for millions [25]. Regarding the Democratic Party, some commentators suggest the party may not learn from what they characterize as the "Biden disaster" [29]. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is described as growing into "Trump's most dangerous attack dog" [48], while media personality Charlamagne Tha God has warned that the "egos" of Trump and Putin could lead to the "end of civilization" [57]. These varied perspectives illustrate the wide range of public commentary surrounding the administration and broader political dynamics.

# AREA 1: TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DOMESTIC POLICIES

## Topic 1.1: Student Visa & University Issues
The Trump administration has launched a significant crackdown on international students in the United States. The government has halted student visa appointments and implemented plans for expanded social media vetting of applicants [44]. Economic expert Raghuram Rajan has warned that restricting foreign students threatens America's future competitiveness [43]. The administration is reportedly using "every tool" available to slow application processing, creating tensions with universities [65]. This policy has particularly affected students at Harvard, where international students describe feeling "used like pawns" in political maneuvering [36]. Israeli students specifically face potential expulsion from Harvard amid this wider crackdown [68]. Legal experts have criticized these actions, with some describing the measures targeting Harvard as "blatantly illegal" [4]. The situation represents a deepening standoff between the administration and universities as affected students face uncertainty about their academic futures.

## Topic 1.2: Immigration & Deportation
The Trump administration continues to pursue aggressive immigration enforcement policies while facing both resistance and implementation challenges. A particularly controversial case involves a critically ill four-year-old Mexican girl who has been ordered to leave the country, with experts warning she could die within days if deported [31]. Meanwhile, the administration has ramped up deportations, though reports indicate it is still falling short of its targeted pace [56]. Officials Stephen Miller and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem are demanding that ICE boost immigrant arrests [62]. At the local level, Santa Fe College has approved an ICE agreement [30]. Contrasting with federal enforcement actions, polling suggests Californians continue to support providing pathways to citizenship for immigrants [42]. These developments illustrate the complex implementation of current immigration policies.

## Topic 1.3: Environmental & Energy Policy
President Trump has signed executive orders aimed at revitalizing the U.S. nuclear power industry [16]. This action aligns with the administration's energy approach, though specific details about these orders are limited in the headline. Simultaneously, the Environmental Protection Agency is implementing new policies that critics characterize as undoing decades of environmental protections [8]. While comprehensive information about these regulatory changes is not available in the headlines, these actions suggest a continued emphasis on energy production over environmental conservation priorities.

## Topic 1.4: Healthcare & Social Services
Budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under the Trump administration have reportedly delayed life-saving treatment for at least one cancer patient, with the article quoting a statement that "cancer shouldn't be political" [74]. In a separate healthcare development, research indicates that Medicare patients receiving emergency surgeries in private-equity hospitals face a 42% increased likelihood of death within 30 days compared to patients at other facilities [34]. These headlines highlight tensions between budget priorities and healthcare outcomes.

## Topic 1.5: Gender & LGBTQ+ Policies
Analysis suggests that the Trump administration's positions on gender issues represent a significant policy shift that extends beyond specific regulations to reflect a broader challenge to government institutions themselves. One publication characterizes these efforts as a "war on gender" that is simultaneously a "war on government" [14]. With limited headlines on this topic, specific policy changes and their implementation cannot be comprehensively assessed.

# AREA 2: ECONOMIC & FINANCIAL AFFAIRS

## Topic 2.1: Housing & Infrastructure
President Trump has announced that the U.S. will retain oversight and guarantees in the planned spinoff of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac [41]. This approach suggests a model that aims to reduce direct government involvement while preserving certain protections in housing finance. One article provides historical context, noting that the federal government once directly built housing for working-class Americans during previous housing crises [32]. This contrast highlights evolving approaches to government's role in addressing housing challenges.

## Topic 2.2: Tax Legislation & "Big, Beautiful Bill"
President Trump's major tax legislation, referred to as the "big, beautiful bill," has encountered unexpected resistance from Elon Musk, head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk has publicly expressed disappointment with the legislation [64, 73], claiming it undermines DOGE's mission [35, 45]. This marks Musk's strongest rebuke of Trump's agenda to date, according to the Financial Times [73]. The bill has also created divisions within Republican ranks, with Senator Ron Johnson stating there are "enough" Republican votes to potentially block it [2], and reports indicating tensions between Senate moderates and conservatives on the issue [51]. Implementation challenges are evident, as at least one Nebraska Representative admitted to voting for the bill without knowing its contents [71].

## Topic 2.3: Trade Policy & Tariffs
Current trade policies are facing scrutiny for their economic impacts. Axios reports that "the argument's over: Americans pay for tariffs," contradicting earlier claims that foreign nations would primarily bear these costs [69]. President Trump has reportedly backed away from imposing tariffs on European Union goods, a move characterized by critics as "TACO trade" (Trump Always Chickens Out) [70]. Separately, researchers warn that declining international tourism to the United States could result in "staggering" economic losses [66]. These developments highlight complex economic considerations in current trade policies.

## Topic 2.4: Cryptocurrency & Financial Markets
The Trump administration shows increased engagement with cryptocurrency markets. Trump Media has announced plans to raise $2.5 billion specifically to invest in bitcoin [46]. Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance is scheduled to speak at a Bitcoin event, with CBS News noting this as evidence of the administration's growing ties to the cryptocurrency sector [61]. These developments suggest an emerging intersection between business interests and cryptocurrency policy, though specific regulatory approaches remain unclear from the available headlines.

## Topic 2.5: Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Operations
A judicial ruling has granted the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, access to sensitive Treasury payment systems and data [22, 54, 67]. Multiple news outlets reported this decision, which appears to expand DOGE's oversight capabilities into core financial operations of the federal government. While specific case arguments are not detailed in the headlines, the ruling marks a significant development in defining the authority of this newly established department within the federal bureaucracy.

# AREA 3: INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS

## Topic 3.1: Middle East Policy & Israel-Palestine
A U.S.-Israel-backed humanitarian initiative in Gaza has faced significant criticism following a deadly rush at an aid distribution site. The United Nations has described scenes at the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's aid site as "heartbreaking," while both the U.S. and Israel continue to defend the initiative [52]. According to Haaretz, President Trump is reportedly frustrated with the situation in Gaza but continues to allow Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to set the terms for conflict management [72]. These headlines reveal tensions in humanitarian aid delivery and bilateral relations despite public alignment on Israel's overall security approach.

## Topic 3.3: US-Canada Relations
U.S.-Canada relations are currently focused on discussions about a "Golden Dome" defense system, with President Trump stating it would cost Canada US$61 billion [5]. Trump has presented Canada with a choice, saying the country would pay this significant sum for the defense system or nothing if it became the "51st state" of the United States [3]. Some reports indicate that Trump has claimed Canada is "considering" becoming a U.S. state in exchange for this protection [28], with some outlets characterizing this as a "wild claim" [55]. The headlines provide no confirmation from Canadian officials about these discussions or the statehood consideration.

Without dedicated reporting on the international relations aspects of student policies, a comprehensive analysis of this dimension cannot be provided.

# AREA 4: LEGAL & JUDICIAL MATTERS

## Topic 4.1: Supreme Court Cases & Petitions
The Trump administration is pursuing immigration policy changes through the Supreme Court, asking justices to lift limits on deportations to "third countries" [12, 26]. This would potentially allow deportations to nations where immigrants have no existing ties. In a separate case, the Court has refused to hear an Apache tribe's plea to prevent copper mining at Oak Flat, a decision that could lead to the creation of a "massive crater" at the site. Justice Neil Gorsuch's dissent called this decision a "grave mistake" [19]. Additionally, President Trump has sought Supreme Court intervention on an unspecified matter [15], though the specific case details are not provided in the headline.

## Topic 4.2: Presidential Pardons & Executive Powers
President Trump plans to pardon reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley [6], exercising his constitutional clemency powers. This action comes amid a reported broader pattern of the Justice Department pulling back from public corruption cases [75]. The headlines don't specify the Chrisleys' offenses or the reasoning behind this particular pardon decision.

President Trump's executive actions face constitutional scrutiny on multiple fronts. Questions have emerged about the constitutionality of his ban on gender-affirming care for transgender prisoners [10]. In a separate case, a judge has strongly criticized a Trump order targeting an unspecified law firm as unconstitutional, reportedly invoking "the founding fathers" in the rebuke [59].

====================
    Round 14
    User: 
====================

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

## ECONOMIC & FINANCIAL AFFAIRS

### Tax Legislation & DOGE Conflict
President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" tax legislation faces unprecedented resistance from Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) head Elon Musk, who has publicly expressed disappointment [1] and claims it undermines DOGE's mission [2]. The Financial Times calls this Musk's "strongest rebuke of US president's agenda yet" [3]. The bill has created divisions within Republican ranks, with Senator Ron Johnson stating there are "enough" Republican votes to potentially block it [4]. Implementation challenges are evident as one Nebraska Representative admitted voting for the bill without knowing its contents [5]. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have reportedly identified a procedural tool to potentially stop the legislation [6].

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

==========Step 6 Requirements End==========

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

END OF DAILY BRIEFING
────────────────────────────

Revisions made:
1. Re-verified that each citation is in the format “[number] TITLE, URL” with two newlines between citations.
2. Cross-checked that every title and URL exactly match the original full JSON record.
3. Ensured all reference lists remain grouped under their respective summary paragraphs.

This completes the updated step7.txt file.


====================
    Round 19
    User: 
====================

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!


====================
    Round 19
    Assistant: 
====================

I'll now perform an editorial check to finalize our report in Markdown format, following all the specified formatting requirements.

Let me review what needs to be changed:

1. Change main title to simply "DAILY BRIEFING"
2. Format first-level headers as "## 1. Title With First Letter Capitalization" with numbering
3. Format second-level headers as "### 1.1 Title" with appropriate numbering
4. Position citations directly after relevant phrases/sentences, not grouped at paragraph ends
5. Add two spaces at the end of each reference line
6. Ensure complete factual accuracy with no hallucinations
7. Use proper Markdown formatting throughout

After performing these edits, I'll present the final step8.md file.
