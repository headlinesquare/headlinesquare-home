# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Actions and Enforcement

### 1.1 Prison System Reform and Alcatraz
President Trump has directed the Bureau of Prisons to reopen Alcatraz prison [1], ordering not just reopening but also expanding the San Francisco Bay facility [2]. He specified it would house the country's "most ruthless" offenders [3] and what he termed "the dregs of society" [4]. Critics have characterized the plan as "clearly unhinged" and "asinine" [5]. The directive represents one of the most significant federal prison policy changes announced in the early months of Trump's second term.

### 1.2 Federal Security and Immigration Policies
The Trump administration is considering labeling some suspected cartel and gang members inside the United States as "enemy combatants" [1]. On the immigration front, a recent case involved a mother being deported to Cuba from Florida while her 17‑month‑old U.S. citizen daughter remained in the United States [2]. Congressional Republicans have rejected an amendment that would have explicitly blocked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from deporting U.S. citizens [3].

### 2.1 Tariffs and Trade Relations
President Trump has announced a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the United States [1][2], an unprecedented move targeting the entertainment industry.
