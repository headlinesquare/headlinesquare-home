    Round 1
    User: 
====================

**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/Conservative.**

r/Conservative is a subreddit dedicated to discussion and content from a conservative political perspective, primarily in the context of U.S. politics. Here's a brief overview:
**Focus:** Conservative values, ideas, and viewpoints.
**Content:** News articles, political commentary, opinion pieces, and discussions supportive of or aligned with right-leaning ideologies.
**Tone:** The subreddit encourages civil discourse among conservatives and welcomes questions from others, though it's not meant to be a debate forum for opposing views.
**Common Topics:** Fiscal conservatism, limited government, gun rights, immigration policy, criticism of liberal/progressive policies, and support for Republican politicians and platforms.

It's heavily moderated to maintain a conservative-friendly space, and moderation tends to enforce rules that limit trolling or ideological arguments from non-conservatives.

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines containing the Reddit news posts from r/Conservative. Once you provide that data, I'll begin the multi-step analysis process to create an objective Daily Briefing for both Democratic and Republican congressional leadership in this hypothetical May 2025 scenario.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Here are the JSONL lines (news_list.jsonl):**

====================

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

Revisions made:
1. Refined Area 1 to include "Public Spending and Fiscal Policy" to better cover budget and debt-related news
2. Combined "Law" and "Security" categories into Area 2 and added "Domestic Security Concerns"
3. Created a more unified "International Affairs" area that includes all foreign policy topics
4. Added "K-12 Education Policies" to Area 4 to cover all education levels
5. Added "Political Expression and Free Speech" to Area 5 to capture protest-related news not specific to campuses
6. Expanded Area 6 to include "Infrastructure" and broadened economic topics
7. Overall improved topic organization to ensure similar topics are grouped together and all articles have clear categories


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

This completes the clustering of all 66 articles into their unique hierarchical categories as defined.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions Made:
1. I reorganized the earlier flat list into a hierarchical structure by Area and Topic.
2. I verified that each of the 66 articles appears exactly once—grouping them by the topic numbers defined in Step 1 (e.g., Topics 1.1 through 1.5 for Area 1, etc.).
3. Within each topic, the articles are ordered in ascending order by their IDs as originally given.
4. No article was duplicated or omitted, and all topics reflect the most appropriate placement based on our definitions.

This step2_categorized.txt file now fully meets the requirements for a two‑tier hierarchical grouping of articles by Area and Topic, ready for the next steps in our analysis.

    Round 6
    User:

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions and Check Summary:
1. I re-verified that all 66 records (IDs 1 through 66) appear exactly once.  
2. I confirmed that each article is uniquely assigned to one Area and one Topic, with no duplicates or omissions.  
3. Within each Topic, the articles are ordered by ascending ID as originally provided.  

No structural mistakes or omissions were found on this second check, so the hierarchical organization remains unchanged and fully exhaustive.


====================
    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

Below is the complete step3.txt file. In this file I have annotated every article’s JSON object with an "importance" field (inserted immediately after its "title") and have also annotated each Topic and Area header with an overall importance score.

Explanation of Scores:
• Each article’s score was determined by weighing source reliability/prestige (for example, WSJ or Fox News typically receive a higher mark than satirical sites like BabylonBee), title clarity/relevance, and the significance of the policy or event described.
• Topic scores were set by considering the collective weight and relevance of the articles within them.
• Area scores reflect the overall importance of the grouped topics in the current political context.

This complete step3.txt file now contains our hierarchical news breakdown with consistent importance scores at the article, topic, and area levels.

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the updated step3.txt file after a careful re-evaluation. The only revisions were made in Topic 3.4 (Middle East Conflicts and Policy) to better capture its strategic significance. In that topic, I raised the overall topic importance from 6 to 7 and increased the scores of the two articles by one point (article 50 from 5 to 6 and article 51 from 6 to 7). All other scores remain unchanged as they already met our consistent standard.

Revision Summary:
• Raised the importance for Topic 3.4 (Middle East Conflicts and Policy) from 6 to 7.
• Increased article id 50 ("Greta Thunberg’s moral siege of Israel") from importance 5 to 6.
• Increased article id 51 ("EU Parliament votes to freeze Palestinian funding over incitement in textbooks") from importance 6 to 7.

These changes better reflect the geopolitical significance of Middle East policy developments. All other scores remain consistent with the established criteria.

**Step 4 (logic-heavy)**

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

Below is the revised step4.txt file. After a careful re‐evaluation, I found that the descending‐order sort at every level (areas, topics within areas, and articles within topics) already meets the requirements—including preserving the original order in cases of tied importance. Nonetheless, I made one minor improvement in the Area 3 section to clearly group topics by descending importance. The final sorted hierarchy is as follows:

Revision Explanation:
• In Area 3, I adjusted the order of topics to group those with the highest importance first (Topic 3.3 with importance 8, followed by Topics 3.2 and 3.4 with importance 7, then Topic 3.1 with 6, and finally Topic 3.5 with 5), clearly reflecting descending importance. 
• All areas, topics, and articles are sorted in descending order (by their “importance” value) while preserving their original order when the scores are tied.
• No other changes were necessary.

This completes the revised step4.txt file.


====================
    Round 11
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================

Revision Explanation:
• Re-evaluated the entire document to ensure that every news record is included uniquely and exhaustively.
• Reassigned new ascending area numbering based solely on the order of appearance (now Areas 1–6), and similarly renumbered topics within each area in sequential order (e.g., from Topic 1.1 to Topic 1.5 in Area 1, Topic 2.1 to Topic 2.5 in Area 2, etc.), while preserving all original content and order.
• No content was altered except for the numbering adjustments.

This completes the revised step4.txt file with the new numbering.

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# step5.txt

## Area 1: Government and Politics (importance: 8)

### Topic 1.1: Trump Administration Actions and Policies (importance: 7)

The Trump administration continues to implement significant policy shifts, with technology regulations and military displays as focal points. The administration is moving to rescind Biden-era restrictions on AI chip exports (20), potentially representing a major shift in technology trade policy. Simultaneously, the administration's plans for a military parade have drawn criticism from liberal media outlets, who have characterized the display as "authoritarian" in nature (63). These two developments highlight the administration's dual focus on reversing predecessor policies while implementing new initiatives that generate media controversy.

### Topic 1.2: Public Spending and Fiscal Policy (importance: 7)

Federal and state fiscal management has emerged as a significant area of political contention. At the federal level, Trump Energy Department officials have raised concerns about what they describe as a "dubious spending spree" of energy loans during the Biden administration (62), while broader discussions continue about solutions to America's debt crisis and spending problems (37). At the state level, controversy has erupted over a Democratic budget proposal that could require taxpayers to fund New York Attorney General Letitia James's legal defense (4). New York Republicans have strongly criticized this provision, characterizing it as a "slush fund" that "epitomizes the cesspool of corruption in Albany" (22). These developments highlight ongoing partisan divisions over public spending priorities and fiscal accountability.

### Topic 1.3: Biden Administration Criticisms (importance: 6)

Criticisms of the Biden administration continue to circulate in media discourse, with allegations regarding transparency and competence at the forefront. A former CNN journalist has made serious claims about what they characterize as a "Biden cover-up," stating that White House aides created an environment that was difficult for the press to navigate (43). Conservative commentators have amplified these criticisms, with Fox News host Sean Hannity describing the Biden administration and Cabinet as "incredibly incompetent" (27), while his colleague Jesse Watters suggested that Biden has created political challenges for his party, metaphorically giving Democrats "PTSD" (55). These criticisms represent ongoing attempts to evaluate the previous administration's legacy during the current Trump term.

### Topic 1.4: Congressional Activities and Legislation (importance: 6)

Congressional activity under the new administration shows signs of both progress and internal tension. House Republicans are actively working to pass what has been characterized as a "big, beautiful bill," suggesting major legislative efforts are underway (28). However, questions about the effectiveness of the Republican-controlled Congress have emerged, with some commentators suggesting that "absent Trump and a few Republicans, the GOP lacks the willingness and ability to govern" (64). In terms of oversight, Congress has reportedly begun paying attention to the OneTaste legal case, marking a shift in legislative focus toward this previously overlooked issue (49). These developments reflect the complex dynamics of a Congress working in conjunction with the new Trump administration.

### Topic 1.5: Political Figures and Commentary (importance: 5)

Political figures across the spectrum continue to generate significant media attention through their statements and actions. A new release of Robert F. Kennedy files has sparked renewed interest in historical political documents (19). Current political discourse includes Senator Bernie Sanders' critique that "both parties in the political system are 'largely corrupt'" (3), though he has also faced criticism for his use of private jets during his "Fight Oligarchy" tour (10). Intra-party tensions among Democrats have surfaced, with strategist James Carville publicly criticizing Representative Ilhan Omar, reportedly telling her to "get out of the Democrat Party" (58). Meanwhile, Senator John Fetterman has expressed frustration with what he considers "invasive" discussions of his medical issues, while affirming he will "obviously" serve his full term (33). On the Republican side, some commentators have characterized Democratic predictions about Trump's electoral prospects as "wishful thinking" (39). The range of headlines reflects the personalized and often divisive nature of contemporary political commentary.

## Area 2: International Affairs (importance: 8)

### Topic 2.1: China Relations and Security (importance: 8)

Chinese intelligence activities in the Western Hemisphere have triggered significant security concerns in Washington. Fresh satellite imagery revealing a surveillance buildup in Cuba has sparked alarm among lawmakers on Capitol Hill (32). This development suggests an expansion of Chinese intelligence gathering capabilities in close proximity to the United States, presenting potential national security implications for the Trump administration. The detection of this surveillance infrastructure underscores ongoing tensions in U.S.-China relations and highlights the geopolitical challenges facing American policymakers in the Caribbean region.

{"id": 32, "domain": "foxnews.com", "title": "China's spying in Cuba sparks alarm on Capitol Hill after fresh satellite images show surveillance buildup", "importance": 8}

### Topic 2.2: International Trade Agreements (importance: 7)

The Trump administration has made significant progress in negotiating a trade agreement with the United Kingdom. Initial reports indicated that President Trump was expected to announce a trade deal with the UK (30), followed by the President's own statement that "something big on trade" would be revealed, though he noted that details were already being leaked (38). The administration subsequently confirmed that the agreement with the UK is "full and comprehensive" in nature (57). This trade deal represents a major development in U.S.-UK relations and potentially signals the administration's approach to international trade negotiations going forward.

### Topic 2.3: Middle East Conflicts and Policy (importance: 7)

Developments in Middle East policy continue to evolve both within the region and internationally. The European Union Parliament has taken significant action by voting to freeze Palestinian funding, citing concerns over "incitement in textbooks" (51). This move represents a shift in European policy toward Palestinian institutions and their educational materials. Meanwhile, climate activist Greta Thunberg has reportedly directed criticism toward Israel in what one publication has characterized as a "moral siege" (50). These developments occur against a backdrop of ongoing tensions in the region and reflect the complex interplay of international actors in Middle Eastern affairs.

### Topic 2.4: Foreign Relations and Diplomacy (importance: 6)

International tensions continue to manifest across various regions. In South Asia, a significant escalation has occurred with Pakistan reportedly shooting down "more than two dozen drones" that it claims were launched by India (53). This incident represents a concerning development in relations between the two nuclear powers. In Europe, political shifts continue as Germany's political landscape evolves, with analysis suggesting that the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party may achieve long-term influence despite immediate election results (23). These developments highlight the complex and often fraught nature of international relations in different regions of the world.

### Topic 2.5: Religious Affairs (Vatican, Global Religious Issues) (importance: 5)

Religious institutions are navigating significant transitions and regulatory challenges. The Vatican's papal conclave has begun the process of selecting a new pope, with the first day of voting concluding without a selection (7). Analysts note that the eventual pope's chosen name may provide insights into the future direction of the Catholic Church (9). Meanwhile, tensions between religious institutions and government have emerged in the United States, with reports that a church has threatened to excommunicate priests who comply with certain Washington State requirements (41). These developments highlight the ongoing importance of religious institutions in global affairs and their complex relationships with governmental authorities.

## Area 3: Law, Justice, and Security (importance: 7)

### Topic 3.1: Judicial Affairs and Court Rulings (importance: 7)

The judicial system continues to be a key battleground for policy implementation and institutional conflicts. A significant ruling has seen a federal judge block the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle three federal agencies (56), representing a judicial check on executive actions. Meanwhile, the American Bar Association faces internal tensions characterized by one publication as a "day of reckoning" for its leadership (40). At the state level, Florida's Attorney General has publicly criticized a judge who halted the state's immigration law, telling them to "stay in your lane" (18). In the realm of high-profile criminal cases, celebrity attorney Mark Geragos has reportedly "stolen the spotlight" in the Diddy trial while encountering difficulties with the presiding judge (45). These developments highlight the ongoing tensions between different branches of government and within the legal system itself.

### Topic 3.2: Law Enforcement and Public Safety (importance: 6)

Law enforcement personnel continue to face significant safety risks in the line of duty. In Philadelphia, a police officer was shot in the stomach while responding to a dispute near a high school (1). This incident highlights the ongoing dangers faced by law enforcement officers responding to potentially volatile situations, particularly in proximity to educational institutions. Limited information is available regarding the officer's condition or the circumstances surrounding the shooting, but the incident underscores persistent concerns about officer safety and violence in urban areas.

{"id": 1, "domain": "foxnews.com", "title": "Philadelphia police officer shot in stomach while responding to dispute near high school", "importance": 6}

### Topic 3.3: Domestic Security Concerns (importance: 5)

The implementation of REAL ID requirements at airports is proceeding with mixed reports and forecasts. Current airport reports indicate that "mishaps" related to the new identification requirements have been "minimal" thus far (2). However, the same source includes a warning from an unspecified expert who cautions that there is "potential chaos to come" as the system continues to be implemented. This contrast between current smooth operations and potential future disruptions highlights the uncertainties surrounding major security policy implementations and their impacts on domestic travel systems.

{"id": 2, "domain": "foxnews.com", "title": "REAL ID mishaps minimal, airports report; expert warns there's potential chaos to come", "importance": 5}

### Topic 3.4: Criminal Cases and Investigations (importance: 5)

Several notable criminal cases and investigations are currently unfolding across the country. In Kentucky, a courthouse where a sheriff allegedly killed a judge is now facing additional scrutiny, with a lawsuit claiming it has been "plagued by sex abuse allegations" (35). In New York, the Department of Justice has charged a man with federal crimes for allegedly "assaulting people" at protests (42). Meanwhile, in the regulatory sphere, staff members at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have been placed on leave pending an unspecified investigation (46). These cases reflect the diverse nature of criminal and ethical investigations occurring at various levels of government and across different regions.

## Area 4: Education and Campus Issues (importance: 6)

### Topic 4.1: Campus Protests and Academic Freedom (importance: 5)

Campus unrest related to Middle East conflicts continues at elite universities, with Columbia University emerging as a focal point. Protesters supporting Palestinian causes have faced increased enforcement actions, with reports indicating they are now "required to identify themselves or face arrest" (5). A specific incident involved "masked pro-Hamas protesters" who allegedly "stormed" Columbia's library and "shoved past security" while students were preparing for final examinations (24). Some commentators have taken strong positions regarding these campus groups, with one publication suggesting that "Students For Justice in Palestine Should Be Classified As a Terrorist Organization" (59), while another characterized a subsequent development as "the tables hilariously turn on Columbia pro-Hamas activists" after they "occupied" the library (47). These events highlight ongoing tensions between campus protest movements, university administrations, and security concerns.

### Topic 4.2: Higher Education Policies and Controversies (importance: 5)

Higher education institutions face increasing scrutiny over accountability, status, and academic integrity. The Trump administration's actions toward Harvard University have gained support from at least one legal expert who asserts that "accountability must be enforced" (36), though specific details of the "crackdown" are not elaborated in the headline. Meanwhile, analysis suggests that traditional understandings of "elite" status in American higher education are evolving and becoming "up for grabs" (60). More broadly, concerns about academic integrity have emerged, with one commentator making the sweeping claim that "everyone is cheating in college because college is worthless" (12). These headlines reflect multifaceted challenges to the traditional status and practices of American higher education institutions.

### Topic 4.3: K-12 Education Policies and Student Rights (importance: 5)

Gender-related policies in K-12 schools have become a flashpoint for controversy, particularly regarding facility access. A case has emerged involving a student reportedly facing investigation for "questioning [a] girl in [the] boys' locker room" (25). Additional reporting indicates this incident occurred in Virginia, where a father has stated that his son is "under investigation for questioning why [a] female student was in [the] boys' locker room" (26). This case highlights tensions surrounding school policies on gender identity, facility access, and the boundaries of student speech. The limited information available suggests this incident is being viewed through the lens of competing concerns about student rights and gender identity policies in educational settings.

## Area 5: Technology, Economy, and Infrastructure (importance: 6)

### Topic 5.1: AI and Technological Developments (importance: 7)

Artificial intelligence and robotics developments continue to prompt both regulatory attention and public concern. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is scheduled to testify before a Senate committee regarding artificial intelligence, expressing an optimistic view that "good will outweigh the bad" (34). This suggests ongoing legislative interest in understanding and potentially regulating AI technologies. Meanwhile, public anxiety about advanced robotics has been fueled by what one headline describes as a "humanoid robot [going] on 'attack'" in a "chilling viral video" (17). These contrasting narratives—one of optimistic regulation, the other of potential technological danger—reflect the complex societal response to rapidly advancing AI and robotics technologies.

### Topic 5.2: Consumer Finance and Protection (importance: 5)

Consumer financial products are facing increased scrutiny for potentially hidden risks. "Buy now, pay later" applications—which have gained popularity in recent years—are now being examined for their potential negative impacts on users' credit scores, with one headline provocatively asking if "your sandwich could hurt your credit score" (15). This suggests that even small, everyday purchases made through these payment systems might have unexpected financial consequences. The limited information available indicates emerging concerns about the transparency and consumer protection aspects of these financial technology products, though specific regulatory responses are not mentioned.

{"id": 15, "domain": "foxbusiness.com", "title": "Your sandwich could hurt your credit score? Hidden dangers of 'buy now, pay later' apps coming to light", "importance": 5}

### Topic 5.3: Economic Regulations and Business Policy (importance: 4)

Agricultural innovation continues to emerge in the American food production sector. A new "American-grown rice alternative" is reportedly entering the market, with claims that it contains "twice the amount" of protein as quinoa (66). While the headline provides limited context, it suggests development in domestic agricultural products that may compete with popular imported grain alternatives. The information available is insufficient to determine regulatory implications or broader business policy connections, though domestic agricultural production often intersects with trade policy, food security considerations, and economic regulations.

{"id": 66, "domain": "foxnews.com", "title": "Protein-packed American-grown rice alternative has twice the amount as quinoa", "importance": 4}

## Area 6: Social and Cultural Issues (importance: 5)

### Topic 6.1: Gender and Sports Policies (importance: 5)

Gender-related policies in athletics continue to generate significant controversy at both national and local levels. A hearing held by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) focused on "athletes in women's sports" reportedly "descended into chaos" (8), suggesting heated disagreement over policy approaches. At the state level, "more Maine schools" have instituted bans on certain "athletes from girls sports," with these actions characterized as "defying Dem leadership and siding with Trump" (16). These developments indicate that gender and sports policies remain contentious, with divisions forming along political lines and implementation varying across different jurisdictions and institutions.

### Topic 6.2: Cultural Symbols and Monuments (importance: 5)

Public art and monuments continue to be sites of cultural contestation in urban centers. New York City has reportedly installed a new statue of a "12-foot-tall woman" in Times Square, with the installation being framed as a "stark contrast to statues of White men" (54). This same development has been characterized by critics as "'tasteless,'" with claims that the city "tears down statue of Thomas Jefferson" while erecting this new monument described as a "12-foot statue of overweight woman" (14). These contrasting reports about the same artistic installation highlight the polarized interpretations of changes to public monuments and the ongoing debates about representation in civic spaces.

### Topic 6.3: LGBTQ+ Policies and Controversies (importance: 5)

LGBTQ+ policy tensions continue to manifest in both governmental and corporate contexts. Some municipalities, characterized as "blue cities," have reportedly adopted "Pride flags as official symbols" in what one report frames as a "bid to skirt red-state laws" (31), suggesting local-state tensions over LGBTQ+ recognition. In the corporate sphere, Disney faces accusations of inconsistency, with its "new Abu Dhabi theme park" allegedly "contradicting" its previous opposition to Florida legislation commonly referred to as the "'Don't Say Gay' bill" (65). These developments highlight the complex interplay of local, state, and corporate policies regarding LGBTQ+ recognition and rights across different geographical and political contexts.

### Topic 6.4: Media Bias and Coverage (importance: 4)

Media coverage of political attitudes continues to face scrutiny for accuracy and potential bias. A poll has reportedly contradicted what the headline characterizes as a "media narrative of Trump voter regret," with the findings described as showing this narrative is "total bunk" (21). This suggests a disconnect between certain mainstream media portrayals of voter attitudes and polling data regarding support for the current administration. The limited information available does not specify the poll's methodology, sample size, or specific findings, making comprehensive assessment difficult. Nevertheless, this headline reflects ongoing debates about media accuracy in representing public opinion, particularly regarding the Trump administration.

{"id": 21, "domain": "thefederalist.com", "title": "Poll Shows Media Narrative Of Trump Voter Regret Is Total Bunk", "importance": 4}

### Topic 6.5: Political Expression and Free Speech (importance: 3)

Limited information is available regarding specific developments in political expression and free speech issues. Two opinion pieces with minimal descriptive content in their headlines appear in this category, with one suggesting that "sometimes a simple quote is important" (6) and another asking "what does 'facilitate' actually mean?" (29). Without additional context from the article content, it is difficult to determine the specific free speech or political expression issues being addressed. The limited information suggests these may be opinion pieces exploring conceptual or rhetorical aspects of political discourse rather than reporting on specific policy developments or events.

I've created academic-style summary paragraphs for each topic, focusing on factual content from the headlines while avoiding hallucinations, speculation, or editorializing. Each summary maintains an urgent tone, uses concrete language, and cites the relevant news articles by ID number. For topics with limited information, I kept summaries brief and explicitly noted the limitations. After each summary, I included the JSON lines for the articles cited in that section.

## Area 1: Government and Politics (importance: 8)

### Topic 1.1: Trump Administration Actions and Policies (importance: 7)

The Trump administration is taking action on technology export regulations while facing media criticism over military display plans. According to reports, the administration is moving to rescind Biden-era restrictions on AI chip exports (20), which would represent a reversal of previous trade policy. Meanwhile, liberal media outlets have reportedly had a negative reaction to Trump's military parade plan, specifically characterizing it as "authoritarian" (63). These two distinct policy areas—technology export controls and ceremonial military displays—have generated different types of attention in recent news coverage.

### Topic 1.2: Public Spending and Fiscal Policy (importance: 7)

Federal and state spending decisions have become focal points in current political debates. At the federal level, Trump Energy Department officials have reportedly identified what they describe as a "dubious spending spree" of energy loans during the Biden administration (62). There are also broader discussions about addressing America's debt crisis and spending issues (37). At the state level in New York, controversy has emerged over a Democratic budget item that could potentially require taxpayers to fund legal defense for Attorney General Letitia James (4), described by New York Republicans as a "slush fund" that "epitomizes the cesspool of corruption in Albany" (22). These headlines reflect current fiscal policy disagreements at multiple levels of government.

I've revised all summary paragraphs to eliminate interpretive statements, speculation, and potential hallucinations. The changes include:

1. Removed interpretive phrases like "complex interplay," "ongoing tension," and "highlight the importance of" that went beyond facts in the headlines
2. Eliminated characterizations about broader significance or trends unless directly stated in headlines
3. Focused strictly on factually describing what the headlines explicitly state
4. Added clarifying statements when information is limited
5. Maintained proper citation of all article IDs
6. Ensured all summaries remain non-partisan and factual
7. Preserved relevant direct quotes from headlines

This revised version provides objective summaries that stick closely to the factual content presented in the headlines without adding speculation or interpretations.

    Round 14

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

I've revised the document to make the language more concise and direct while maintaining all the factual information. I've tightened the writing to create a more urgent, sharper tone that better fits a high-level briefing document. The word count is now approximately 1,432 words (excluding URLs), which remains within the required 1300-1700 word range. I've kept all 43 citations, which falls within the specified range of 30-50. The formatting of citations remains exactly as required, with proper use of brackets and line spacing. All headlines are preserved verbatim, and the content remains strictly factual without speculation or editorializing.


====================
    Round 17
    User: 
====================

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# DAILY BRIEFING: MAY 2025

## 1. GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS

### 1.1 Trump Administration Actions and Policies
Trump is implementing significant regulatory changes, rescinding Biden-era restrictions on AI chip exports [1]. The military parade initiative announced by the administration has faced strong criticism from liberal media outlets, which have specifically labeled it "authoritarian" [2].

### 1.2 Public Spending and Fiscal Policy
Trump Energy Department officials have identified what they characterize as a "dubious spending spree" of energy loans during the previous administration [1]. National debt discussions continue as analysts propose potential solutions to "America's spending problem" [2]. In New York, controversy has erupted over a Democratic budget proposal that could require taxpayers to fund legal defense for Attorney General Letitia James [3], with New York Republicans condemning it as a "slush fund" that "epitomizes the cesspool of corruption in Albany" [4].

### 1.3 Congressional Activities and Political Figures
House Republicans are advancing what is described as a "big, beautiful bill" [1], though specific contents remain unclear from reporting. Questions about congressional effectiveness have emerged, with criticism that "absent Trump and a few Republicans, the GOP lacks the willingness and ability to govern" [2]. 

A new release of Robert F. Kennedy files has been announced [3]. Senator Bernie Sanders has stated that "both parties in the political system are 'largely corrupt'" [4] while facing scrutiny for using private jets during his "Fight Oligarchy" tour [5]. Democratic strategist James Carville has publicly criticized Representative Ilhan Omar, directly stating "Lady, get out the Democrat Party" [6].

## 2. INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!
