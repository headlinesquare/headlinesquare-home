# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Trump Administration Executive Authority and Governance

### 1.1 Presidential Powers and Court Rulings
The Supreme Court has dramatically expanded presidential authority by granting President Trump's request to fire independent agency members, while explicitly exempting the Federal Reserve and Chairman Jerome Powell [1]. Justice Kagan issued a dissent condemning the elevation of "President over our precedent" [2]. This ruling is described by critics as "killing the independent agency" [3]. Chief Justice Roberts has separately stayed a lower court order that would have required DOGE to surrender documents to a watchdog organization [4].

### 1.2 Presidential Actions and DOGE Operations
President Trump is set to sign orders to boost nuclear power as early as Friday [1]. The administration hosted a "memecoin contest" dinner that drew bipartisan criticism for allegedly selling access to the president [2], generating $148 million amid distribution of $100,000 gem-encrusted watches [3]. Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is expanding his Grok AI system throughout government operations, raising conflict of interest concerns [4]. Officials are implementing polygraph tests to identify even minor information leaks [5].

### 1.3 Agency Restructuring
DHS staff are being inserted into FEMA before hurricane season begins [1], while FEMA denied North Carolina's Hurricane Helene disaster aid request [2].

## 2. Economic and Trade Policy

### 2.1 Tariffs and International Trade
President Trump has threatened sweeping new tariffs, including 50% duties on European Union imports [1] and 25% penalties on Apple products not manufactured in the United States [2]. He justified the EU tariff decision by claiming trade talks were "going nowhere" [3]. These actions triggered significant market disruptions, described by analysts as a "scorched earth trade war" [4]. Puerto Rico is actively pursuing manufacturing facilities displaced by escalating trade tensions [5].

### 2.2 Domestic Economic Impact
The Trump administration has cut scientific research funding to its lowest level in decades [1]. States have been forced to cancel millions in rural broadband investments following the administration's termination of the Digital Equity Act, reportedly because the legislation contained the word "equity" [2]. Moody's downgrade has intensified investor concerns about the U.S. fiscal trajectory [3].
