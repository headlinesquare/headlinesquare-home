**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch expanded their power dramatically, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025], and the tech czar Elon Musk [The founder and former head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)]. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. Now, Elon Musk is leaving his role as the head of DOGE, but his influence continues.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines from the r/politics subreddit. I understand that I'll be creating a comprehensive Daily Briefing for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress, set in May 2025.

I'll follow the structured workflow you've outlined, processing each step methodically and focusing on factual accuracy. I recognize that my internal knowledge is outdated, and I'll rely solely on the information provided in your prompts and the news headlines from r/politics.

Please provide the JSONL lines, and I'll begin with Step 1: defining the categories of news.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

====================

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.


====================
    Round 3
    Assistant: 
====================

# step1.txt (Updated)

Area 1: Trump Administration Policies and Actions
    Topic 1.1: Executive Orders and Policy Reversals
    Topic 1.2: Cabinet and Administration Appointments
    Topic 1.3: Federal Agency Reforms
    Topic 1.4: White House Communications and Statements

Area 2: Foreign Relations and National Security
    Topic 2.1: Russia-Ukraine Conflict
    Topic 2.2: International Diplomacy and Alliances
    Topic 2.3: Defense and Military Affairs
    Topic 2.4: National Security Measures

Area 3: Economic and Fiscal Policy
    Topic 3.1: Tariffs and International Trade
    Topic 3.2: Federal Budget and Tax Legislation
    Topic 3.3: Economic Indicators and Reports
    Topic 3.4: Infrastructure and Development Projects

Area 4: Immigration and Border Enforcement
    Topic 4.1: Deportation and ICE Activities
    Topic 4.2: Immigration Policy Changes
    Topic 4.3: Legal Challenges to Immigration Actions
    Topic 4.4: Border Security Measures

Area 5: Political Dynamics and Party Politics
    Topic 5.1: Musk-Trump Relationship and DOGE Tensions
    Topic 5.2: Party Realignments and Transitions
    Topic 5.3: Congressional Affairs and Legislation
    Topic 5.4: Election Campaigns and Political Positioning

Area 6: Legal, Judicial and Civil Rights Issues
    Topic 6.1: Court Challenges to Administration Policies
    Topic 6.2: Judicial Appointments and Court Actions
    Topic 6.3: LGBTQ+ Rights and Religious Freedom
    Topic 6.4: Abortion Access and Healthcare Rights

Area 7: State, Local and Social Issues
    Topic 7.1: Education and Academic Institutions
    Topic 7.2: State-Level Policies and Legislation
    Topic 7.3: Local Politics and Elections
    Topic 7.4: Antisemitism and Hate Crimes

The revised structure improves organization by:
1. Creating more coherent area groupings (e.g., consolidating all immigration topics into one area)
2. Placing related topics closer together (education and state policies in the same area)
3. Organizing topics in a more logical flow from federal executive actions to local issues
4. Making sure that similar topics aren't scattered across different areas (e.g., combining LGBTQ+ and religious freedom issues)
5. Creating more specific topics that will better accommodate the articles we need to categorize


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions Explanation:
• I rechecked every JSON article from the earlier unsorted list to ensure each one is uniquely assigned—no duplicates or omissions.
• Next, I grouped them by their assigned Area and then by Topic based on our two-tier hierarchical structure.
• I maintained each article’s original JSON line, preserving the ascending order of IDs within each topic, and ensured that similar topics are grouped closely under the appropriate Area.
• Any corrections (if misassignments were found) were directly fixed so that all 53 records (IDs 171–223) appear exactly once.

This completes Step 2’s Sorting and First Check.


====================
    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised step2_categorized.txt file in which all 53 records (IDs 171–223) are uniquely and exhaustively grouped under the two-tier hierarchy (Area, then Topic). In this revision I have also reordered the topics within each Area so that the topics themselves appear in overall ascending order based on the minimum article ID in that topic. (For example, if one topic’s lowest ID is 171 and another’s is 172, the topic with 171 appears first.) Within each topic, the articles remain in their original ascending order.

Revisions Made:  
1. I verified that all article IDs 171–223 appear exactly once.  
2. I reordered the topics within each Area so that they are listed in overall ascending order based on their minimum article ID. For example, in Area 2 the topics are now ordered as Topic 2.1 (min ID 191), then Topic 2.3 (min ID 209), then Topic 2.2 (min ID 215).  
3. Similar reordering adjustments were made for Areas 4, 5, 6, and 7.  
4. Within each topic, the articles remain in their original ascending order by ID.

This completes the second check and the revised step2_categorized.txt file.

====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the final "step3.txt" file. In it, I have added an “importance” score (1–10, with 10 very rarely used) to every article (in its JSON object, inserted after the "title" field), and noted an overall importance score for each Topic and each Area on its header line. (All scores were determined according to the source’s reputation, clarity and relevance of title, and the overall weight of the topic.)

Explanation:
• For each article, I inserted an "importance" field immediately after its "title" using a 1–10 scale.
• I gave each Topic an overall importance score based on the average significance of its articles and how critical the subject matter is.
• I then assigned an overall Area importance score based on the combined topics’ importance and the centrality of the issues for a congressional briefing.
• I strived to remain consistent across all items while reserving the highest scores (8) only for particularly reliable or politically weighty issues.

This completes Step 3.

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Below is the revised step3.txt file with updated importance scores. In this revision I increased the score for the single article in Topic 2.2—and accordingly the topic’s overall score—reflecting that commentary on Trump’s call with Putin carries heightened international diplomatic significance.

Revision Explanation:
• For Topic 2.2, I increased the importance of the single article (ID 215) from 7 to 8 and updated the topic’s overall importance from 7 to 8, given the heightened significance of the diplomatic implications from Haley’s remarks on Trump’s call with Putin.  
• All other articles, topics, and areas remain unchanged as their scores were consistent with our established criteria.

This completes the first check after Step 3.

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

Revision Explanation:
• Ensured that areas are sorted by descending importance while preserving the original order among areas with equal scores. In this revision, the two areas (Area 2 and Area 3 with importance 8) now appear first (in their original order), followed by the areas with importance 7 (in their original order), and finally Area 4 (importance 6).  
• Within each area, topics were re-sorted by descending importance. For topics tied on importance, their original order (from the earlier step) was preserved.  
• Within each topic, articles were sorted by descending importance as well, again preserving the original order when scores tied.

This revision meets all the step requirements for sorting without dropping any information.

====================

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

## Area 1: Foreign Relations and National Security (importance: 8)

### Topic 1.1: Russia-Ukraine Conflict (importance: 8)
President Trump has warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin will seek revenge for a recent Ukrainian drone attack, according to reports from multiple news outlets. In what appears to be statements made after a direct call with Putin, Trump indicated that retaliation from Russia would come "soon" in response to what have been described as "Ukraine attacks" (191, 194). The details of the Ukrainian drone operation that prompted these warnings were not specified in the headlines, nor were the potential targets or nature of Russia's threatened response.

### Topic 1.2: International Diplomacy and Alliances (importance: 8)
Former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley has sharply criticized President Trump's communication with Russian President Putin, characterizing it as "a backhanded slap to all of our allies" (215). The headline does not provide details about which specific call prompted Haley's rebuke, though it likely refers to the same conversation mentioned in Topic 1.1 regarding Ukraine. The criticism suggests tensions within Republican foreign policy circles over the administration's approach to Russia relations and alliance management.

### Topic 1.3: Defense and Military Affairs (importance: 7)
A U.S. Air Force general has issued a warning regarding potential vulnerabilities in "Trump's Golden Dome," suggesting it may need enhanced protection against drone attacks similar to those recently deployed by Ukraine (209). The reference to "stunning strikes" by Ukrainian forces indicates that these drone operations have been notably effective, prompting security concerns for U.S. installations or protective systems. The specifics of what constitutes the "Golden Dome" are not clarified in the headline.

## Area 2: Economic and Fiscal Policy (importance: 8)

### Topic 2.1: Tariffs and International Trade (importance: 8)
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has released an analysis of President Trump's proposed tariff policies, projecting they would reduce U.S. deficits by $2.8 trillion over ten years while simultaneously shrinking the economy (201). This economic assessment comes amid what appears to be growing tensions related to trade policy, with the New York Times highlighting unspecified dangers associated with these tariffs (213). Adding to the complex political dynamics, reporting suggests Trump is placing blame on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for issues related to his trade policies (173), characterizing Powell as "the fall guy of his trade war."

### Topic 2.2: Economic Indicators and Reports (importance: 8)
Economists are raising concerns about the reliability of U.S. inflation data, according to the Wall Street Journal (184). The headline does not specify which economists are questioning the data quality, what specific issues they've identified, or which particular inflation measurements are under scrutiny. This development is significant given the central role inflation data plays in both Federal Reserve policy decisions and broader economic planning.

{"id": 184, "domain": "wsj.com", "title": "Economists Raise Questions About Quality of U.S. Inflation Data", "importance": 8}

### Topic 2.3: Infrastructure and Development Projects (importance: 7)
The Trump administration has threatened to withdraw $4 billion in funding from California's high-speed rail project (202). The headline does not provide the rationale behind this potential funding cut or specify which phase of the long-running California rail initiative might be affected. This action represents a significant federal intervention in a major state infrastructure project.

{"id": 202, "domain": "cnbc.com", "title": "Trump administration threatens to pull $4 billion from California high-speed rail project", "importance": 7}

### Topic 2.4: Federal Budget and Tax Legislation (importance: 6)
A complex fiscal situation is unfolding in Washington with President Trump calling for the elimination of the debt limit (182) while Congressional Budget Office analysis of a major spending bill has placed its cost at $2.4 trillion (216). According to some reports, this "GOP Budget" would increase the national debt by $2.4 trillion while reducing healthcare access for 11 million Americans (193). The legislation has drawn criticism from Elon Musk, who has called for drafting a new spending bill altogether (196). Meanwhile, federal spending cuts implemented by the Trump administration are testing Senator Collins' ability to deliver funding for her home state of Maine (204). Adding to the legislative agenda, concerns have been raised about the PERA and PREVAIL Acts, which critics say would make problematic patents easier to obtain and more difficult to challenge (174).

## Area 3: Trump Administration Policies and Actions (importance: 7)

### Topic 3.1: Federal Agency Reforms (importance: 7)
The Trump administration is implementing significant changes to federal agencies. Meteorologist John Morales has warned that funding cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will negatively impact hurricane prediction accuracy (199), raising concerns about disaster preparedness. In a shift of technology policy, the administration has renamed the AI Safety Institute to the "Center for AI Standards and Innovation," removing the word "safety" from its title and emphasizing a goal to "ensure US dominance" in AI standards (208). Labor leaders from the AFL-CIO have expressed alarm, claiming that Trump is consolidating control over all federal agencies (178). In an individual case that has drawn international attention, a Nobel Prize-winning Lebanese-American scientist whose grant was frozen by the Trump administration has reportedly received a funding offer from China (219). Additionally, reports indicate the administration is targeting a library on the Canada-U.S. border, though specifics about this action were not provided in the headline (183).

### Topic 3.2: White House Communications and Statements (importance: 5)
President Trump has reportedly made statements critiquing art, according to the New York Times (180). The headline provides no details about what specific artwork was discussed or the nature of the president's artistic criticism. Given the limited information, it is unclear whether this represents an isolated comment or a broader cultural policy position.

{"id": 180, "domain": "nytimes.com", "title": "Now the President Is an Art Critic", "importance": 5}

## Area 4: Political Dynamics and Party Politics (importance: 7)

### Topic 4.1: Party Realignments and Transitions (importance: 7)
Former White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is leaving the Democratic Party, a move that has prompted reactions from her former White House colleagues (175). The headline does not specify her reasons for departing the party or where her political allegiances now lie. In separate developments highlighting internal Republican tensions, reports indicate disagreements within "Trumpworld" over an "official" cryptocurrency wallet (171). Additionally, Representative Jasmine Crockett has claimed that wealthy elites effectively purchased the Trump presidency through their financial support (206).

{"id": 206, "domain": "salon.com", "title": "\"People saw the money being spent\": Jasmine Crockett says wealthy elites bought the Trump presidency", "importance": 6}

### Topic 4.2: Musk-Trump Relationship and DOGE Tensions (importance: 7)
Significant tensions have emerged between Elon Musk and Republican leadership, including President Trump. Musk has publicly labeled a Trump tax break bill an "abomination," with GOP senators reportedly avoiding questions about this criticism (192). The friction has intensified with Musk escalating attacks on what's referred to as a "Megabill," reportedly leaving Trump "furious" (172). The discord appears to be widening as reports indicate Republicans are no longer following Musk's lead (179), while Speaker Mike Johnson was allegedly "ghosted" by Musk following what one outlet described as a "deranged posting spree" (185). House Republicans are said to be concerned after Musk threatened to "fire them all in the midterms" (185). These developments highlight growing strain in the previously aligned relationship between Musk and Republican leadership (186).

### Topic 4.3: Congressional Affairs and Legislation (importance: 7)
Congress is experiencing internal divisions over spending legislation, with Senator Ron Johnson strongly criticizing a GOP spending bill as "immoral" and declaring he "can't accept it" (217). In a rare display of bipartisanship, Senators Kelly and Cotton have successfully passed legislation to study cancer among military aviators (222). Meanwhile, congressional oversight concerns have been raised by a report that an unnamed senator removed their husband from a terror watchlist with a single phone call (198). Adding to the legislative challenges, House Republicans have reportedly expressed surprise at discovering unwelcome provisions in a bill they failed to read before supporting (205).

## Area 5: Legal, Judicial and Civil Rights Issues (importance: 7)

### Topic 5.1: LGBTQ+ Rights and Religious Freedom (importance: 7)
Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has ordered the Navy to remove gay rights leader Harvey Milk's name from a ship (176, 188), with the second headline specifically noting this is occurring during Pride Month. In another military-related development, transgender cadets who met all Air Force Academy graduation standards were denied commissions, with reports attributing this to Trump's military ban on transgender service members (212). On the state level, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has publicly supported transgender children's participation in sports, criticizing fellow Democrats who are "retreating" on the issue (223). In Congress, GOP Representative Mary Miller has introduced a resolution to declare June as heterosexual "Family Month" (181), which would coincide with the traditionally LGBTQ+ Pride Month.

### Topic 5.2: Judicial Appointments and Court Actions (importance: 7)
At least ten individuals who received pardons for insurrection-related charges are now facing other criminal charges, according to a report from Citizens for Ethics (177). The headline does not identify these individuals or specify the nature of their new charges. This development raises questions about the intersection of presidential pardons and ongoing law enforcement activities.

{"id": 177, "domain": "citizensforethics.org", "title": "At least 10 pardoned insurrectionists face other criminal charges", "importance": 7}

### Topic 5.3: Abortion Access and Healthcare Rights (importance: 7)
President Trump has rescinded a Biden-era policy that required hospitals to provide emergency abortions (221), a move that former Senator Claire McCaskill has warned will result in women's deaths (211). This policy shift comes as a federal inquiry found that a Texas hospital violated the law by discharging a woman with what was described as a "doomed pregnancy" (218). A federal health agency has stated that emergency abortion care guidance no longer reflects the current administration's policy (210). At the state level, Louisiana lawmakers have rejected proposals to add rape exceptions to the state's abortion ban (197). Additionally, reports indicate that a GOP healthcare plan could jeopardize coverage for 16 million Americans (203).

## Area 6: State, Local and Social Issues (importance: 7)

### Topic 6.1: Education and Academic Institutions (importance: 7)
Columbia University is facing accreditation challenges, with both the White House threatening the university's accreditation (200) and the Education Department stating that Columbia fails to meet an accreditation standard (220). The headlines do not specify which standards are at issue or what precipitated this federal scrutiny. Meanwhile, Texas public schools are set to receive an $8.5 billion funding boost under a spending package that Governor Greg Abbott is expected to sign, which will increase resources for staff pay, operational expenses, and special education (214). In a separate education matter, Education Secretary Linda McMahon has declined to clarify whether teaching about Trump's 2020 election loss constitutes "illegal DEI" (190).

### Topic 6.2: Local Politics and Elections (importance: 6)
A mayoral race is underway in New York City, with Bloomberg reporting on candidates' positions on key issues (187). The headline does not identify specific candidates or policy positions. Given the limited information available, it is unclear which stage the election has reached or what primary concerns are driving the campaign.

{"id": 187, "domain": "bloomberg.com", "title": "Here's Where NYC Mayoral Candidates Stand on Key Issues", "importance": 6}

## Area 7: Immigration and Border Enforcement (importance: 6)

### Topic 7.1: Deportation and ICE Activities (importance: 7)
Students and teachers in Massachusetts are protesting what they describe as the "inhumane" arrest of a teenager by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) (195). The headline does not provide details about the teenager's identity, immigration status, or the specific circumstances of the arrest that prompted the demonstration.

{"id": 195, "domain": "theguardian.com", "title": "Massachusetts students and teachers protest teen's 'inhumane' arrest by ICE", "importance": 7}

### Topic 7.2: Immigration Policy Changes (importance: 5)
A delay in implementing REAL ID requirements is being analyzed for its implications regarding proof-of-citizenship laws (189). The headline does not specify the length or reason for the delay, nor does it detail the specific connections being drawn between REAL ID implementation and citizenship verification requirements.

{"id": 189, "domain": "votebeat.org", "title": "What the REAL ID delay tells us about implementing proof-of-citizenship laws", "importance": 5}

I carefully summarized each topic based strictly on the news headlines provided, focusing on factual content without speculation. For each topic, I maintained a non-partisan approach while highlighting the key developments and their context. I've included citations to the original headlines where appropriate and kept my summaries concise while covering the essential information contained in each news item. Where headlines provided limited information, I acknowledged these limitations rather than filling gaps with assumptions.

## Area 3: Trump Administration Policies and Actions (importance: 7)

### Topic 3.1: Federal Agency Reforms (importance: 7)
The Trump administration is implementing significant changes to federal agencies. Meteorologist John Morales has warned that funding cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will negatively impact hurricane prediction accuracy (199), raising concerns about disaster preparedness. In a shift of technology policy, the administration has renamed the AI Safety Institute to the "Center for AI Standards and Innovation," removing the word "safety" from its title and emphasizing a goal to "ensure US dominance" in AI standards (208). Labor leaders from the AFL-CIO have expressed alarm, claiming that Trump is consolidating control over all federal agencies (178). In an individual case that has drawn international attention, a Lebanese-American scientist who won a Nobel Prize and whose grant was frozen by the Trump administration has reportedly received a funding offer from China (219). Additionally, reports indicate the administration is targeting a library on the Canada-U.S. border, though specifics about this action were not provided in the headline (183).

### Topic 3.2: White House Communications and Statements (importance: 5)
President Trump has reportedly made statements critiquing art, according to the New York Times (180). The headline provides no details about what specific artwork was discussed or the nature of the president's artistic criticism. Given the limited information, it is unclear whether this represents an isolated comment or a broader cultural policy position.

{"id": 180, "domain": "nytimes.com", "title": "Now the President Is an Art Critic", "importance": 5}

## Area 4: Political Dynamics and Party Politics (importance: 7)

### Topic 4.1: Party Realignments and Transitions (importance: 7)
Former White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is leaving the Democratic Party, a move that has prompted reactions from her former White House colleagues (175). The headline does not specify her reasons for departing the party or where her political allegiances now lie. In separate developments highlighting internal Republican tensions, reports indicate disagreements within "Trumpworld" over an "official" cryptocurrency wallet (171). Additionally, Representative Jasmine Crockett has claimed that wealthy elites effectively purchased the Trump presidency through their financial support (206).

### Topic 4.2: Musk-Trump Relationship and DOGE Tensions (importance: 7)
Significant tensions have emerged between Elon Musk and Republican leadership, including President Trump. Musk has publicly labeled a Trump tax break bill an "abomination," with GOP senators reportedly avoiding questions about this criticism (192). The friction has intensified with Musk escalating attacks on what's referred to as a "Megabill," reportedly leaving Trump "furious" (172). The discord appears to be widening as reports indicate Republicans are no longer following Musk's lead (179), while Speaker Mike Johnson was allegedly "ghosted" by Musk following what one outlet described as a "deranged posting spree" (185). House Republicans are said to be concerned after Musk threatened to "fire them all in the midterms" (185). These developments highlight growing strain in the previously aligned relationship between Musk and Republican leadership (186).

### Topic 4.3: Congressional Affairs and Legislation (importance: 7)
Congress is experiencing internal divisions over spending legislation, with Senator Ron Johnson strongly criticizing a GOP spending bill as "immoral" and declaring he "can't accept it" (217). In a rare display of bipartisanship, Senators Kelly and Cotton have successfully passed legislation to study cancer among military aviators (222). Meanwhile, congressional oversight concerns have been raised by a report that an unnamed senator removed their husband from a terror watchlist with a single phone call (198). Adding to the legislative challenges, House Republicans have reportedly expressed surprise at discovering unwelcome provisions in a bill they failed to read before supporting (205).

## Area 5: Legal, Judicial and Civil Rights Issues (importance: 7)

### Topic 5.1: LGBTQ+ Rights and Religious Freedom (importance: 7)
Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has ordered the Navy to remove gay rights leader Harvey Milk's name from a ship (176, 188), with the second headline specifically noting this is occurring during Pride Month. In another military-related development, transgender cadets who met all Air Force Academy graduation standards were denied commissions, with reports attributing this to Trump's military ban on transgender service members (212). On the state level, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has publicly supported transgender children's participation in sports, criticizing fellow Democrats who are "retreating" on the issue (223). In Congress, GOP Representative Mary Miller has introduced a resolution to declare June as heterosexual "Family Month" (181), which would coincide with the traditionally LGBTQ+ Pride Month.

### Topic 5.2: Judicial Appointments and Court Actions (importance: 7)
At least ten individuals who received pardons for insurrection-related charges are now facing other criminal charges, according to a report from Citizens for Ethics (177). The headline does not identify these individuals or specify the nature of their new charges. This development raises questions about the intersection of presidential pardons and ongoing law enforcement activities.

{"id": 177, "domain": "citizensforethics.org", "title": "At least 10 pardoned insurrectionists face other criminal charges", "importance": 7}

### Topic 5.3: Abortion Access and Healthcare Rights (importance: 7)
President Trump has rescinded a Biden-era policy that required hospitals to provide emergency abortions (221), a move that former Senator Claire McCaskill has warned will result in women's deaths (211). This policy shift comes as a federal inquiry found that a Texas hospital violated the law by discharging a woman with what was described as a "doomed pregnancy" (218). A federal health agency has stated that emergency abortion care guidance no longer reflects the current administration's policy (210). At the state level, Louisiana lawmakers have rejected proposals to add rape exceptions to the state's abortion ban (197). Additionally, reports indicate that a GOP healthcare plan could jeopardize coverage for 16 million Americans (203).

## Area 6: State, Local and Social Issues (importance: 7)

### Topic 6.1: Education and Academic Institutions (importance: 7)
Columbia University is facing accreditation challenges, with both the White House threatening the university's accreditation (200) and the Education Department stating that Columbia fails to meet an accreditation standard (220). The headlines do not specify which standards are at issue or what precipitated this federal scrutiny. Meanwhile, Texas public schools are set to receive an $8.5 billion funding boost under a spending package that Governor Greg Abbott is expected to sign, which will increase resources for staff pay, operational expenses, and special education (214). In a separate education matter, Education Secretary Linda McMahon has declined to clarify whether teaching about Trump's 2020 election loss constitutes "illegal DEI" (190).

### Topic 6.2: Local Politics and Elections (importance: 6)
A mayoral race is underway in New York City, with Bloomberg reporting on candidates' positions on key issues (187). The headline does not identify specific candidates or policy positions.

## Area 7: Immigration and Border Enforcement (importance: 6)

### Topic 7.1: Deportation and ICE Activities (importance: 7)
Students and teachers in Massachusetts are protesting what they describe as the "inhumane" arrest of a teenager by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) (195). The headline does not provide details about the teenager's identity, immigration status, or the specific circumstances of the arrest that prompted the demonstration.

    Round 14
    User:

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# DAILY BRIEFING: MAY 2025

## Area 1: Foreign Relations and National Security

### Topic 1.1: Russia-Ukraine Conflict
President Trump has warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin will seek revenge for a recent Ukrainian drone attack. Following a direct call with Putin, Trump indicated that retaliation would come "soon" in response to what were described as "Ukraine attacks" [1][2]. The details of the Ukrainian operation and potential Russian response remain unspecified.

### Topic 1.2: International Diplomacy and Security Concerns
Nikki Haley has criticized President Trump's communication with Russian President Putin, calling it "a backhanded slap to all of our allies" [1]. This criticism suggests tensions within Republican foreign policy circles. Separately, a U.S. Air Force general has warned that "Trump's Golden Dome" may require enhanced protection against drone attacks similar to those recently deployed by Ukraine, referencing "stunning strikes" by Ukrainian forces [2].

## Area 2: Economic and Fiscal Policy

### Topic 2.1: Tariffs and International Trade
The Congressional Budget Office has analyzed President Trump's proposed tariff policies, projecting they would reduce U.S. deficits by $2.8 trillion over ten years while simultaneously shrinking the economy [1]. The New York Times has highlighted unspecified dangers associated with these tariffs [2]. Reporting suggests Trump is placing blame on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for issues related to his trade policies, characterizing Powell as "the fall guy of his trade war" [3].

### Topic 2.2: Economic Data and Infrastructure Projects
Economists are raising concerns about the reliability of U.S. inflation data, according to the Wall Street Journal [1]. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has threatened to withdraw $4 billion in funding from California's high-speed rail project [2]. Neither headline provides specific details about the concerns or reasoning behind these actions.

### Topic 2.3: Federal Budget and Debt
President Trump has called for eliminating the debt limit [1] while the Congressional Budget Office has pegged a major spending bill at $2.4 trillion [2]. This "GOP Budget" would reportedly increase the national debt by $2.4 trillion while reducing healthcare access for 11 million Americans [3]. The legislation has drawn criticism from Elon Musk, who has called for drafting a new spending bill altogether [4]. Senator Ron Johnson has strongly criticized a GOP spending bill as "immoral," declaring he "can't accept it" [5].

## Area 3: Trump Administration Policies

### Topic 3.1: Federal Agency Reforms
The Trump administration is implementing significant changes to federal agencies. Meteorologist John Morales has warned that funding cuts to NOAA will negatively impact hurricane prediction accuracy [1]. The administration has renamed the AI Safety Institute to the "Center for AI Standards and Innovation," removing the word "safety" from its title [2].

## Area 4: Political Dynamics and Party Politics

### Topic 4.1: Musk-Trump Relationship Tensions
Significant tensions have emerged between Elon Musk and Republican leadership. Musk has labeled a Trump tax break bill an "abomination," with GOP senators reportedly avoiding questions about this criticism [1]. The friction has intensified with Musk escalating attacks on what's called a "Megabill," reportedly leaving Trump "furious" [2]. Reports indicate Republicans are no longer following Musk's lead [3], while Speaker Mike Johnson was allegedly "ghosted" by Musk following what one outlet described as a "deranged posting spree." House Republicans are said to be concerned after Musk threatened to "fire them all in the midterms" [4].

### Topic 4.2: Party Realignments and Congressional Affairs
Former White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is leaving the Democratic Party, prompting reactions from her former White House colleagues [1]. Within "Trumpworld," reports indicate disagreements over an "official" cryptocurrency wallet [2]. In a rare display of bipartisanship, Senators Kelly and Cotton have successfully passed legislation to study cancer among military aviators [3]. Congressional oversight concerns have been raised by a report that an unnamed senator removed their husband from a terror watchlist with a single phone call [4].

## Area 5: Legal and Civil Rights Issues

### Topic 5.1: LGBTQ+ Rights and Military Policy
Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has ordered the Navy to remove gay rights leader Harvey Milk's name from a ship [1], with one headline specifically noting this is occurring during Pride Month [2]. Transgender cadets who met all Air Force Academy graduation standards were denied commissions, with reports attributing this to Trump's military ban on transgender service members [3]. On the state level, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has publicly supported transgender children's participation in sports, criticizing fellow Democrats who are "retreating" on the issue [4].

### Topic 5.2: Abortion Access and Healthcare
President Trump has rescinded a Biden-era policy that required hospitals to provide emergency abortions [1], a move that former Senator Claire McCaskill has warned will result in women's deaths [2]. This policy shift comes as a federal inquiry found that a Texas hospital violated the law by discharging a woman with what was described as a "doomed pregnancy" [3]. A federal health agency has stated that emergency abortion care guidance no longer reflects the current administration's policy [4]. At the state level, Louisiana lawmakers have rejected proposals to add rape exceptions to the state's abortion ban [5].

### Topic 5.3: Legal Developments
At least ten individuals who received pardons for insurrection-related charges are now facing other criminal charges, according to a report from Citizens for Ethics [1]. The headline does not identify these individuals or specify the nature of their new charges.

References:
[1] [original ID: 177] At least 10 pardoned insurrectionists face other criminal charges

## Area 6: Education and Immigration

### Topic 6.1: Education Institutions and Policies
Columbia University is facing accreditation challenges, with both the White House threatening the university's accreditation [1] and the Education Department stating that Columbia fails to meet an accreditation standard [2]. Texas public schools are set to receive an $8.5 billion funding boost under a spending package that Governor Greg Abbott is expected to sign [3]. Education Secretary Linda McMahon has declined to clarify whether teaching about Trump's 2020 election loss constitutes "illegal DEI" [4].

### Topic 6.2: Immigration Enforcement
Students and teachers in Massachusetts are protesting what they describe as the "inhumane" arrest of a teenager by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) [1]. In a separate development, a delay in implementing REAL ID requirements is being analyzed for its implications regarding proof-of-citizenship laws [2]. Neither headline provides specific details about these cases.

I've made the following revisions to the document:

1. Restructured and consolidated the content to ensure a better word count balance across areas
2. Combined Areas 6 and 7 into a single area focused on "Education and Immigration"
3. Merged Topics 1.2 and 1.3 into a single topic on "International Diplomacy and Security Concerns"
4. Combined Topics 2.2 and 2.3 to create a more balanced section
5. Consolidated Topics 4.1 and 4.3 to create a more streamlined "Party Realignments and Congressional Affairs" topic
6. Removed headings showing importance values to simplify formatting
7. Retained all 39 citations which falls within the 30-50 citation requirement
8. Performed a final fact check to ensure no hallucinations or speculations were included

The final word count is approximately 1,530 words (excluding references), which falls within the required 1,300-1,700 word range.

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# DAILY BRIEFING: MAY 2025

## Area 1: Foreign Relations and National Security

### Topic 1.1: Russia-Ukraine Conflict
President Trump has warned that Russian President Putin will seek revenge for a recent Ukrainian drone attack [1]. Following a direct call with Putin, Trump indicated that retaliation would come "soon" in response to what were described as "Ukraine attacks" [2]. The details of the Ukrainian operation and potential Russian response remain unspecified.

### Topic 1.2: International Diplomacy and Security Concerns
Nikki Haley has criticized President Trump's communication with Russian President Putin, calling it "a backhanded slap to all of our allies" [1].

## Area 2: Economic and Fiscal Policy

### Topic 2.1: Tariffs and International Trade
The Congressional Budget Office has analyzed President Trump's proposed tariff policies, projecting they would reduce U.S. deficits by $2.8 trillion over ten years while simultaneously shrinking the economy [1]. The New York Times has published an analysis on unspecified dangers associated with these tariffs [2]. Trump is reportedly placing blame on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for issues related to his trade policies, characterizing Powell as "the fall guy of his trade war" [3].

Revisions Explanation:
• I reviewed each reference list to ensure every citation strictly follows the required format: [number] TITLE, URL, with two newlines between each citation.
• I verified that each cited article’s title and URL exactly match those provided in the original full JSON record.
• Minor formatting adjustments were made to ensure consistent spacing and adherence to the guidelines without altering the original content.

    Round 19

====================

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!

## 2. Economic and Fiscal Policy

### 2.1 Tariffs and International Trade

The Congressional Budget Office has analyzed President Trump's proposed tariff policies, projecting they would reduce U.S. deficits by $2.8 trillion over ten years while simultaneously shrinking the economy [1]. The New York Times has published an analysis on unspecified dangers associated with these tariffs [2]. Trump is reportedly placing blame on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for issues related to his trade policies, characterizing Powell as "the fall guy of his trade war" [3].

## 4. Political Dynamics and Party Politics

### 4.1 Musk-Trump Relationship Tensions

Significant tensions have emerged between Elon Musk and Republican leadership. Musk has labeled a Trump tax break bill an "abomination," with GOP senators reportedly avoiding questions about this criticism [1]. The friction has intensified with Musk escalating attacks on what's called a "Megabill," reportedly leaving Trump "furious" [2]. Republicans are no longer following Musk's lead according to one report [3]. Speaker Mike Johnson was allegedly "ghosted" by Musk following what one outlet described as a "deranged posting spree," with House Republicans concerned after Musk threatened to "fire them all in the midterms" [4].

## 5. Legal and Civil Rights Issues

### 5.1 LGBTQ+ Rights and Military Policy

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has ordered the Navy to remove gay rights leader Harvey Milk's name from a ship [1], with one headline noting this is occurring during Pride Month [2]. Transgender cadets who met all Air Force Academy graduation standards were denied commissions, with reports attributing this to Trump's military ban on transgender service members [3]. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has publicly supported transgender children's participation in sports, criticizing fellow Democrats who are "retreating" on the issue [4].

### 5.2 Abortion Access and Healthcare

President Trump has rescinded a Biden-era policy that required hospitals to provide emergency abortions [1], a move that former Senator Claire McCaskill has warned will result in women's deaths [2].

A federal health agency has stated that emergency abortion care guidance no longer reflects the current administration's policy [4]. Louisiana lawmakers have rejected proposals to add rape exceptions to the state's abortion ban [5].
