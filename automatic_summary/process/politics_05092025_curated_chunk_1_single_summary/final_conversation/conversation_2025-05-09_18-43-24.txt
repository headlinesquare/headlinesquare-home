    Round 1
    User: 
====================

**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines. Once you provide them, I'll begin the step-by-step process of transforming them into an objective Daily Briefing for both Democratic and Republican congressional leadership.

I understand the context is May 2025, with President Trump and Elon Musk (as DOGE head) expanding executive power. I'll analyze the news feed from r/politics with consideration of source credibility, potential bias, chronology of events, and political significance to create a comprehensive briefing that serves leaders from both parties.

Please provide the JSONL lines when you're ready.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

    Topic 8.1: Climate Change Policy & Monitoring
    Topic 8.2: Public Lands & Resource Extraction
    Topic 8.3: Environmental Regulation & Energy Policy

**Explanation of Revisions:**

I made several improvements to the categorization system:

1. Refined topic names to be more specific and comprehensive
2. Merged previous Area 8 (Opposition & Democratic Activity) into relevant policy areas to maintain focus on issues rather than partisan divisions
3. Created a dedicated Environmental & Resource Management area to better categorize several articles on public lands, climate monitoring, and resource policies
4. Improved the logical flow between areas by ensuring related policy domains are grouped together
5. Made topic descriptions more specific to ensure all articles have a clear "best fit" category
6. Balanced the distribution of topics across areas to improve usability for human cognition
7. Ensured terminology is neutral and accessible to both Democratic and Republican leadership

These changes maintain the required structure of 8 areas with hierarchical topics while improving the categorization's clarity and comprehensiveness.


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Each line now uniquely categorizes an article into one major area and its corresponding topic as defined in Step 1.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 5
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the new file “step2_categorized.txt” with all records grouped first by their assigned Area, then by Topic, and then listing the JSON lines (each appearing exactly once) in ascending order (by ID) within each topic.

Revisions and Explanations:

1. I sorted all 108 records by their assigned Area (using Areas 1 through 8) and, within each area, grouped them under the appropriate Topic (using the two‐tier hierarchy defined earlier).
2. Within each Topic, the JSON lines were re‐ordered in ascending order by their original ID to preserve their recorded order.
3. I removed the previous inline header markers (e.g. “[Area 2: … / Topic 2.3: …]”) so that each JSON line now appears solely under its area and topic heading.
4. I verified that every record appears exactly once and that similar topics are grouped together in their most meaningful category.

This revised “step2_categorized.txt” now provides a clear, two‐tier hierarchical view (Area → Topic) of all the news articles for future steps.


====================
    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised “step2_categorized.txt” file after a full independent re‐check. In this pass I verified that every one of the 108 records appears exactly once (with no duplicates or omissions), and that within each topic the JSON lines are in ascending order by their IDs. I made a minor adjustment in a couple of topic groupings to ensure the IDs are strictly ascending, though no article was dropped or misassigned.

Revisions and Explanations:

1. A full independent check confirmed that all 108 records are present and appear only once.  
2. I verified that within each topic the JSON lines are sorted in strictly ascending order by their ID.  
3. Minor adjustments were made in the ordering (ensuring, for example, that topics with only a single record remain correctly placed) but no article was re-categorized differently from the previous assignment.

This revised “step2_categorized.txt” now exhaustively and uniquely covers all records in the proper two-tier (Area → Topic) hierarchy.

    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

Below is the complete file “step3.txt” with every article’s JSON object now including an “importance” value (inserted immediately after the "title" field) and with each topic and area header annotated with its overall importance score. I used a consistent 1–10 scale based on source credibility, content clarity, and topical relevance (while reserving the top scores for the most notable stories).

Explanation of the Revisions:
1. For each article I inserted an "importance" field (with values ranging from 1 to 10) immediately after the "title." These scores were chosen based on the source’s reliability and the clarity, relevance, and news value of the headline.
2. I then assessed the cumulative weight of the articles within each topic and assigned a corresponding topic importance score.
3. Finally, I calculated an overall importance for each Area (aggregating its topics) and annotated the area headers accordingly.
4. This consistent, non‐saturated scoring framework ensures that every record is evaluated on the same scale and that high-profile or highly reliable stories receive appropriately higher scores.

This “step3.txt” file now fully reflects the scoring step.

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised “step3.txt” file after my careful re‐evaluation. In this revision I made one adjustment to an individual article’s importance score for greater consistency. All articles now have an “importance” field inserted immediately after the “title” field, and every topic and area header carries an overall importance score (on the same 1–10 scale) determined by a review of the source reliability, clarity, relevance, and overall news weight.

Explanation of Revisions:
1. After re‐evaluating the scores, I found that the article in Topic 6.4 from abcnews.go.com (id 50, "House passes bill to make 'Gulf of America' name change permanent") had an importance score of 6. I have lowered its importance score to 5 to better reflect its relatively lower immediate significance compared to its peers in that topic.
2. I re‐checked all JSON objects to ensure every news article has a unique “importance” field inserted immediately after “title,” and that each topic and area header carries a consistent overall importance score. No other changes were required.

This revised “step3.txt” now fully meets the requirements with improved internal consistency.

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

Explanation:
1. Areas were first sorted by their overall importance value (all with importance 7 came before Area 1 which has importance 6), preserving original order among tied areas.
2. Within each Area, Topics are sorted in descending order by their importance. For example, in Area 1, Topic 1.2 (importance 8) comes before Topics 1.1 and 1.4 (both importance 6) – which in turn come before Topic 1.3 (importance 5); ties preserve the original order.
3. Within each Topic, Articles are sorted in descending order by their “importance” value, keeping the original order when multiple articles share the same importance.

This completes Step 4.

Explanation of Revisions:
1. After a careful re‐evaluation of the sorting, I verified that each area is now ordered in descending importance—with all areas rated 7 (in their original relative order) appearing before Area 1 (rated 6).
2. Within each area, topics have been re-sorted so that those with higher importance appear first; for example, in Area 2 the topics with importance 7 (Topics 2.1 and 2.3) now precede Topic 2.2 (importance 6), with original order preserved among ties.
3. In each topic, articles are grouped by descending “importance” and within each group the original submission order is maintained. A minor adjustment was made in Topic 2.3 to ensure that articles with importance 7 (id 39 and id 41) are now listed before those with importance 6 (id 27 and id 84).

This revised step4.txt fully meets the requirements for sorting while preserving all original content.

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Explanation of Revisions:
1. I carefully reviewed the previous step4.txt to ensure every record is present exactly once.
2. I reassigned new ascending numbering to areas and topics such that the first area in the document becomes “Area 1”, the second “Area 2”, etc.
3. Within each area, I renumbered the topics in their original order (e.g., the first topic in Area 1 is now “Topic 1.1”, the second “Topic 1.2”, and so forth).
4. All article records and content remain unchanged; only the organizational numbering has been updated.

This completes the updated step4.txt as required.

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

  Topic 1.1: Federal Prosecution Appointments (Importance: 7)
    President Trump has appointed Fox News host and former judge Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, one of the most significant federal prosecutor positions in the country [1, 18, 34, 36]. This appointment comes after Trump indicated he would replace his previous pick for the position, Ed Martin [51]. Multiple media outlets have reported on this transition from media personality to chief federal prosecutor in Washington DC, a position with jurisdiction over numerous federal cases in the nation's capital [4, 11, 14, 17].

  Topic 1.2: Constitutional Challenges & Judicial Decisions (Importance: 7)
    Federal courts have imposed significant checks on the Trump administration's actions. A judge has barred the administration from shrinking agencies that fund libraries and settle labor disputes [39], part of a broader pattern where Trump is reportedly "losing more than he's winning" in court [41]. In a notable case, judges ruled against Alabama's congressional map, striking it down as racially discriminatory [27]. Separately, legal arguments have emerged that a computer ban gave the government an unfair advantage in a case involving an anti-war activist [84].

  Topic 1.3: Legal Investigations & Court Cases (Importance: 6)
    Several high-profile legal matters have emerged involving the Trump administration. The Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia James [44], marking an unprecedented federal probe into a state law enforcement official. In the case of Kilmar Ábrego García, the administration has invoked state secrets privilege [15], while DHS Secretary reportedly defied a Supreme Court order, stating there is "no scenario" where Ábrego García would return to the U.S. [80, 29]. Separately, Attorney General Pam Bondi has made claims about "tens of thousands of videos" involving Jeffrey Epstein and children [30], and reportedly disclosed sensitive information about the Epstein case to someone posing as a nanny [97].

Area 2: Foreign Policy & International Relations (Importance: 7)
  Topic 2.1: Global Security & Military Engagement (Importance: 8)
    Concerns about global security and the potential for major conflicts have risen to prominence, with analysis comparing the current geopolitical situation to historical precedents from World War II [100]. The examination of these historical lessons suggests heightened vigilance about the possibility of broader military conflicts. However, specific details about current U.S. military engagements or security postures under the Trump administration are not elaborated in the available headlines.

  Topic 2.2: Russia-Ukraine Conflict & Peace Negotiations (Importance: 7)
    The Trump administration has taken a direct role in Ukraine-Russia peace negotiations, with President Trump proposing "ideally a 30-day ceasefire" backed by sanctions [53]. Vice President JD Vance has claimed that "Russia has asked for territory it hasn't won" during negotiations [8]. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has acknowledged that Putin is a war criminal while maintaining that peace talks should proceed [46]. The administration has indicated it is prepared to abandon negotiations if Russia demonstrates bad faith, with Vance stating the US is ready to "walk away" under such circumstances [69].

  Topic 2.3: Middle East Policies & Conflicts (Importance: 7)
    The Trump administration faces multiple challenges in Middle East policy. Houthi forces have claimed the U.S. "backed down" in regional conflicts and asserted that Israel is not covered by a ceasefire agreement [70]. Domestically, the administration has taken action against pro-Palestinian protests at universities including Columbia and the University of Washington [9]. In a significant policy shift, President Trump has reportedly dropped requirements for Israeli ties as a precondition for Saudi nuclear negotiations [43]. Meanwhile, Senator Bernie Sanders has criticized the U.S.-backed 68-day blockade of humanitarian aid to Gaza, describing it as "a slow, brutal process of mass starvation" [73].

  Topic 2.4: International Diplomacy & Bilateral Relations (Importance: 7)
    Tensions have emerged in U.S. relations with key allies. Denmark has formally summoned the U.S. ambassador [92] and issued warnings to the Trump White House regarding allegations of spying activities in Greenland [85]. Meanwhile, the U.S. Ambassador to Canada has attempted to defuse controversy by claiming that President Trump's comments about making Canada the "51st state" are now "behind us" and "done" [32]. The specific details of a situation described as "Modern day Appeasement" remain unclear from the available headlines [5].

Area 3: Economic Policy (Importance: 7)
  Topic 3.1: Tariffs & International Trade (Importance: 7)
    President Trump has dramatically reshaped U.S. trade policy through aggressive tariff strategies and new bilateral agreements. The administration has concluded what Trump called a "breakthrough trade agreement" with the United Kingdom [68], which reduces tariffs on cars and metals [77] while reportedly putting pressure on Chinese supply chains [105]. This deal has drawn criticism from American auto manufacturers, with the "Detroit Three" automakers publicly opposing the UK arrangement [21]. On China policy, Trump has indicated support for imposing 80% tariffs [96], though he appears to have delegated final decision-making authority to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent [101]. Reports suggest China has decided to negotiate on tariffs [74]. The administration has been selective in its tariff implementation, threatening new duties on Mattel toys [89] while exempting luxury brands like Rolls Royce [99].

  Topic 3.2: Taxation & Fiscal Management (Importance: 7)
    The Trump administration's fiscal priorities are coming into focus with significant budget reductions for some agencies and clarifications on tax policy. The Peace Corps is reportedly preparing for "deep cuts" as part of the administration's budgetary priorities [94]. On taxation, President Trump has shifted his position, now stating that Republicans should "probably not" raise taxes on wealthy Americans [108], suggesting a recalibration of the administration's approach to fiscal policy and taxation of high-income earners.

  Topic 3.3: Business Regulations & Corporate Relations (Importance: 6)
    Corporate relationships with the Trump administration have produced mixed outcomes across various sectors. Senate Democrats have blocked a cryptocurrency regulation bill, citing concerns about President Trump's personal cryptocurrency investments [81]. In aviation, defense contractor L3 Harris has been selected to modify a Qatari jet as a potential replacement for Air Force One following delays with Boeing [49]. Meanwhile, a prominent New York law firm is reportedly losing employees after a deal with the Trump administration encountered problems [67].

  Topic 3.4: Economic Impacts & Consumer Effects (Importance: 6)
    The economic impacts of the Trump administration's tariff policies are becoming apparent across multiple sectors. Businesses have begun explicitly labeling tariff costs on customer receipts to explain price increases [55], while economic analyses suggest the tariffs will cause economic pain regardless of whether a recession occurs [91]. Democrats have proposed legislation requiring retailers to display the cost of tariffs on products [90]. There are concerns that the administration's confrontational approach to the Federal Reserve could undermine economic stability [106]. Consumer goods have become focal points in trade disputes, with Trump reportedly threatening to block the sale of Barbie dolls in the U.S. [86]. Some commentators have characterized the resulting price increases as "Trumpflation" [83].

Area 4: Immigration & Border Security (Importance: 7)
  Topic 4.1: Deportations & ICE Enforcement (Importance: 7)
    The Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement has resulted in highly visible deportation operations. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have conducted raids resulting in detentions and arrests, including a "chaotic scene" in Worcester [33]. One particularly controversial incident captured on video showed ICE agents physically struggling with a mother who was clinging to her baby [98]. A deported Cuban mother has publicly appealed to President Trump for family reunification [107]. These incidents reflect what observers characterize as a systematic approach of denying entry, detaining individuals, and conducting deportations as part of a hardline agenda that has "torn up the rule book" on immigration enforcement [56].

  Topic 4.2: Refugee & Asylum Policies (Importance: 7)
    The Trump administration has established a new refugee priority, with officials working to bring the first group of white Afrikaner refugees from South Africa to the United States [61, 64, 71]. According to multiple reports, this initiative marks the first time Afrikaners have been granted refugee status by the U.S. government, with their arrival scheduled for the immediate future. This policy represents a distinct shift in refugee admission priorities under the current administration.

Area 5: Social Policy & Civil Rights (Importance: 7)
  Topic 5.1: Racial Equity & Voting Rights (Importance: 7)
    Federal courts have delivered a significant ruling on voting rights in Alabama, striking down the state's congressional districting map [63]. The court explicitly found that Alabama "purposely" diluted Black votes with its redistricting plan [38]. This decision represents a notable judicial intervention on racial equity in electoral map-drawing, with judges determining that the state's actions constituted deliberate racial discrimination in violation of voting rights protections.

  Topic 5.2: Education & Public Health Initiatives (Importance: 7)
    Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced plans to create an autism database that will utilize Medicare and Medicaid information [3]. The limited information available suggests this represents a significant data collection initiative involving sensitive healthcare information, though details about implementation, privacy protections, or the specific purpose of the database are not elaborated in the headlines.

  Topic 5.3: LGBTQ+ Policies & Transgender Rights (Importance: 6)
    The Pentagon has initiated the removal of up to 1,000 transgender service members from the U.S. military [6, 87], implementing a policy shift under the Trump administration. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has reportedly established a specific deadline for completing this personnel action [35]. At the state level, Utah has quietly removed reports documenting transgender youth mental health statistics from its Department of Health and Human Services website—reports that had previously indicated higher suicide risk among transgender students, particularly when targeted by discriminatory laws [2].

  Topic 5.4: Religious & Cultural Issues (Importance: 6)
    A diverse set of cultural and religious developments has emerged, notably including tensions between the new Pope Leo XIV and the Trump administration. The pope has publicly shared criticism of President Trump and Vice President Vance on social media [20, 25], prompting reactions from both the administration [75] and commentators [59]. Previously unknown comments by the new pontiff have reportedly caused concern among LGBTQ+ Catholics [78]. In U.S. politics, former President Biden has defended his mental capabilities while attributing Vice President Harris's electoral defeat to sexism [10], and has engaged a veteran Democratic operative to protect his reputation [12]. Democrats have identified priority districts for the 2026 midterm elections [72]. Congress has passed legislation to permanently rename a body of water as the "Gulf of America" [50].

  Topic 6.1: Libraries & Federal Information Services (Importance: 7)
    President Trump has abruptly fired Carla Hayden from her position as Librarian of Congress [28, 31, 48, 54, 62, 95, 102], a move widely reported across multiple news outlets. Hayden, who is from Baltimore [37], had been serving in this role as the head of the nation's oldest federal cultural institution. University librarians have emerged as opponents to what one headline characterized as the administration's "war on information" [58]. The dismissal has reportedly triggered strong reactions from Democratic lawmakers [76], coming amid what some sources describe as a broader "purge of government" [102].

In creating the summaries, I focused on synthesizing the headlines into concise, factual paragraphs while avoiding hallucinations or speculation. For each topic, I:

1. Carefully analyzed all headlines to identify core developments and common themes
2. Prioritized articles with higher importance scores (7-8) for citation
3. Maintained objectivity by avoiding partisan language or policy recommendations
4. Kept summaries concrete and specific rather than using generic phrasing
5. Used citations [ID numbers] to ground all factual claims
6. Included the relevant JSON data directly below each summary
7. Kept discussions proportional to topic importance and available information

I was particularly careful to only state what was directly supported by the headlines without adding my own interpretations or filling gaps with speculation, especially for topics with limited information like Topic 6.3 on data privacy.

─────────────────────────────  

After carefully reviewing the document, I made the following revisions to address potential issues:

1. Removed speculative connections between events where headlines didn't explicitly state those connections
2. Made Topic 2.1 (Global Security) much more concise since it had only one headline
3. Added attribution language ("According to...", "reportedly") throughout to clearly indicate these are reported claims rather than established facts
4. Removed any inferences about motivations or intentions not explicitly stated in headlines
5. For Topic 6.3 (Data Privacy), made the summary even more strictly limited to the exact language in the headline
6. Shortened several paragraphs to focus strictly on verifiable facts from the headlines
7. Added specific attribution for quotes (especially for DHS Secretary regarding Abrego Garcia)
8. Removed any language that might appear partisan or judgmental
9. Made sure every name and fact directly corresponds to what's stated in the headlines

These changes ensure the summaries remain strictly fact-based, avoid hallucinations, and present the information as objectively as possible based solely on the headlines provided.


====================
    Round 14
    User: 
====================

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions Explanation:
• I rechecked each citation to confirm that both the article titles and URLs exactly match the original JSON records.
• I adjusted the formatting so that each citation is presented on its own line with a blank line between entries, following the “[#] TITLE, URL” format.
• I ensured that every reference list remains embedded under its corresponding summary section rather than compiled at the end of the document.

All requirements have now been met.


====================
    Round 19
    User: 
====================

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!
