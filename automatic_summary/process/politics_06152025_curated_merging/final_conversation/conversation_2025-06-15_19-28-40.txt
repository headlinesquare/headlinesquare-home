**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch expanded their power dramatically, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025], and the tech czar Elon Musk [The founder and former head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)]. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. Now, Elon Musk is leaving his role as the head of DOGE, but his influence continues.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

---

Because there are several hundreds of news articles posted in some subreddit communities every day, it is hard to summarize all of them in a single process. Fortunately, I have already broken the articles in that day into chunks by submission time in the 24 hour coverage window in ascending order, and generated summaries for each chunk with LLMs. Those detailed summary chunks will be posted here. Each has a length of 1300-1700 words without counting the URLs, and citing 30-50 news articles. 

The chunks are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, there are 4 chunks, and the news coverage cycle is from yesterday's 18:00 to today's 18:00. Chunk 1 is from the articles submitted between 18:00 of yesterday to 06:00 of today, Chunk 2 is for 06:00 to 10:00 today, Chunk 3 is for 10:00 to 14:00 today, and Chunk 4 is from 14:00 to 18:00 today. The first chunk is based on the earliest articles submitted to the subreddit community. The last chunk is based on the latest articles submitted. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in Chunk 2 **happen** after all the news stories in Chunk 1, just because they are **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from Chunk 1 and B from Chunk 2, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This rule applies to all chunks in sequential order. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from different chunks. 

**Your task is to critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks, and then faithfully merge all of them into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks.** 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

---

Please tell me if you are ready to receive the individual summaries. I will provide them all at once. And please follow my later instructions, be patient, do the work step by step.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the individual summaries. I understand I'll need to:

1. Critically analyze all summary chunks
2. Merge them into a single comprehensive daily briefing
3. Maintain a similar tone, format, style, and length as the individual chunks
4. Prioritize factual accuracy, using only information from the provided materials
5. Avoid speculation when headlines lack details
6. Be cautious about political figures' current titles and positions, using only information from your lists or what's explicitly stated in the news

I'll process all the material at once and provide the complete Daily Briefing after careful analysis.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1**

Comparing:

Please critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks provided below. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You must use your limited length to summarize the most important news, while skipping the secondary.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.

Please carefully think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. **You will do the merging task in the next round with my detailed instructions. Please do not attempt to write down your summary at this step, because you haven't been given the full instructions yet!** It is always better to take some time to think clearly for such a difficult task, and make detailed plans for yourself, before taking any actions. You should use this opportunity to prepare yourself for your next round of work by writing down some notes for yourself.

### 2.2 Democracy and Autocracy Concerns

Protesters expressing opposition to President Trump have voiced concerns that he is "shredding our constitution, our government" [1]. Multiple commentaries have emerged arguing that in the United States, "the people rule, not wannabe King Trump" [2]. A historian who previously criticized billionaires for not paying enough taxes is now calling for "moral ambition" to counter what they characterize as tyranny [3].

Coverage contrasts were evident, as Fox News hosts reportedly "gushed over the parade, with no protests in sight" [4]. The parade coincided with widespread "No Kings" protests occurring nationwide [3].

## 3. Foreign Policy and International Relations

### 3.1 Israel-Iran Conflict

Israel and Iran have exchanged military strikes amid statements from President Trump that the conflict "should end" [1] and "can be easily ended" [2]. The situation has grown more complex with reports that Israel has asked the US to participate in strikes on Iran's nuclear sites [3], while Trump has threatened Iran with "retaliation at levels never seen before" [4]. Analysis suggests Netanyahu has "outplayed Trump on Iran," potentially pulling the US into broader conflict [5].

### 6.2 Democratic Party Developments

California Governor Gavin Newsom has reportedly "stepped up to parry Trump's 'wrecking ball' attacks on American democracy," with analysis suggesting "this moment was thrust upon him" [1]. In New York City politics, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has rallied against what she termed Governor Cuomo's "gerontocracy," framing a mayoral race "as a referendum on the Democratic Party" while supporting candidate Zohran Mamdani [2]. Senator John Fetterman has broken with many Democrats by praising Trump's military parade, stating it comprised "the very best of us and should be celebrated" [3].

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Actions and Federal Authority

### 1.1 Military Deployment Against Civilians

President Trump has taken the extraordinary step of deploying federal troops against civilians in California in response to protests against immigration raids. The Guardian reports that Trump "seized on LA protests against immigration raids to deploy troops against civilians in the liberal bastion – a fight he had long been spoiling for" [1]. This federal intervention has triggered immediate pushback from state leaders, with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro "reaffirming his control over Pennsylvania's National Guard after Trump took control of California's troops" [2]. In addition, Governor Gavin Newsom has reportedly formulated his own strategy to resist the federal overreach [3].

### 1.2 Border Enforcement Expansion

Border Patrol has significantly expanded its "roving patrols," raising urgent civil rights concerns as U.S. citizens are now being detained during these operations. The Los Angeles Times reports that these activities have heightened fears of racial profiling in affected communities, with enforcement practices potentially detaining citizens alongside undocumented immigrants [1].

### 1.3 Military Parade Controversy

A military parade connected to Trump and described in relation to a "happy birthday" event has generated substantial controversy. USA Today reports the event sparked "pushback and peril" [1], while critics have compared it to "Soviet-style parades" [2]. Factual reports indicate portions of the crowd left the event early [3], and at least one Republican lawmaker criticized the parade for "glorifying weapons" [4]. The event has also drawn international mockery, as "Internet Trolls Around the World Are Mocking Trump's Military Birthday Parade" [5].

## 2. Foreign Policy

### 2.1 Israel-Iran Conflict Management

President Trump is navigating a precarious balance in the escalating Israel-Iran conflict. In a significant intervention, U.S. officials report that Trump vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate Iran's supreme leader [1], potentially preventing a dramatic escalation in regional tensions. Simultaneously, the President has maintained a tough posture by stating the U.S. "could get involved" in the conflict [2] and warning Iran with claims that he would "come down on you at levels never seen before" if U.S. interests were attacked [3]. Further complicating diplomatic dynamics, Trump expressed willingness to consider Putin as a mediator between Israel and Iran [4].

## 3. Judicial Checks and Administration Oversight

### 3.1 Voting Rights Decree Blocked

A federal judge has dealt a significant blow to the administration by blocking what Democracy Docket characterizes as "Trump's Anti-Voting Decree," ruling that the order would likely disenfranchise voters [1]. Although details regarding the decree's provisions are sparse, the ruling emphasizes the potential negative impact on voting rights.

[1] Federal Judge Blocks Trump's Anti-Voting Decree, Says it Would Likely Disenfranchise Voters, https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/judge-halts-trump-anti-voting-executive-order-disenfranchise-voters/  

### 3.2 Federal Appointments Scrutiny

The administration now faces questions about its internal vetting process after reports emerged that Trump's nominee for the Federal Aviation Administration falsely claimed to hold a commercial pilot license [1]. This allegation intensifies scrutiny over the qualifications required for high-level federal positions.

[1] Trump's FAA Nominee Lied About Having a 'Commercial' Pilot License, https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trumps-faa-nominee-lied-commercial-pilot-license-1235365087/  

### 3.3 Government Corruption Case

A serious corruption case has surfaced as a USAID official pleaded guilty to involvement in a $550M bribery scheme, admitting to having "violated the public trust" [1]. The scope of this bribery scandal suggests that the investigation could have far-reaching implications for federal contracting and oversight.

### 3.4 Healthcare Policy Economic Impact

An overhaul associated with Kennedy is forecast to drive up the cost of vaccines, as reported by The Hill [1]. While details remain limited—and it is unclear if this refers to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the current Secretary of Health and Human Services—the proposed changes could significantly influence public health expenditures.

## 4. Political Opposition and Public Response

### 4.1 "No Kings" Protest Movement

A large-scale protest movement under the banner "No Kings" has emerged in opposition to the Trump administration. Organizers claim "a million people protested across the country," with particularly visible demonstrations near Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida [1] [2]. The movement shows a surprising geographic diversity—extending into "rural, conservative Wyoming" [3]—and while most protests have remained peaceful, some states saw violent incidents [4]. Additional estimates indicate that up to 6 million people may have participated in the demonstrations, underscoring the movement's extensive reach [5].

### 4.2 Political Violence

A troubling incident of political violence has struck as Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota were shot, according to reporting by The Washington Post [1]. While the headline provides few details regarding the incident's context or perpetrators, the attack underscores the growing dangers faced by public officials.

[1] What to know about the Democratic lawmakers shot in Minnesota, https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/06/15/melissa-hortman-minnesota-lawmaker-john-hoffman/  

### 4.3 Democratic Party Challenges

The Democratic Party now faces a dual challenge: rebuilding electoral competitiveness while mending internal divisions. NPR reports that Democrats are working on a strategy to win back young male voters who "swung for Trump in 2024" [1]. In parallel, factional conflicts are reportedly "jeopardizing hopes of Democratic comeback" [2], highlighting internal strains in the post-2024 political landscape.

[2] Infighting jeopardizes hopes of Democratic comeback, https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5350066-democrats-fractures-fight-after-trump-win/  

## 5. Public Opinion and Cultural Trends

### 5.1 Trust in Political Institutions

Public confidence in the political system appears to be waning, with a recent poll showing that "neither political party gets good marks on honesty" [1]. This widespread skepticism poses challenges for both parties as they attempt to rally support for their policy agendas.

[1] Poll: Neither political party gets good marks on honesty, https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/poll-neither-political-party-gets-good-marks-honesty-rcna212686  

### 5.2 Media Coverage and Sports Events

Media coverage reflects a mix of political and cultural concerns. The Guardian reports that "raids and fear cast a large shadow over Club World Cup's big launch" [1], highlighting how non-political events can still be steeped in an atmosphere of tension. In addition, the longstanding "Sunday Morning Political Cartoon Thread" continues to offer satirical commentary on current events [2]. Another perspective comes from coverage of Trump's parade in Washington, with detailed analysis noting that "The Military's Birthday Parade Rolls Quietly Through Trump's Washington" [3].

### 5.3 LGBTQ+ Policies

Information regarding LGBTQ+ rights and policies in the current political climate remains insufficient, as the available headline is incomplete. Readers are advised to consult the source directly for further details [1].

3. **Israel-Iran Conflict**: Both discuss Trump's role in managing escalating tensions
4. **Immigration Enforcement**: Both cover raids and policy implementation/changes
5. **Military Parade Controversy**: Both mention public response and attendance issues

## Key Differences:
- **Chunk 1** emphasizes financial disclosures, RFK Jr.'s appointments, global perception of US leadership, and Democratic figures' responses
- **Chunk 2** focuses more on military deployment against civilians in California, border patrol activities, judicial checks on executive power, and incidents of political violence

## Proposed Merged Structure:
1. **Executive Actions and Federal Authority**
   - Military Deployment and Federal Interventions
   - Immigration Enforcement and Policy Changes
   - Administration Appointments and Personnel
   - Financial Disclosures and Ethics

2. **Public Response and Democratic Opposition**
   - "No Kings" Nationwide Protests
   - Democracy and Autocracy Concerns
   - Political Violence and Security
   - Democratic Party Positioning

3. **Foreign Policy and International Relations**
   - Israel-Iran Conflict Management
   - Global Perception of US Leadership
   - US-Russia Relations

4. **Judicial Checks and Legislative Developments**
   - Court Rulings on Executive Actions
   - New Legislation and Regulatory Changes
   - Supreme Court Decisions

5. **Public Opinion and Media Coverage**
   - Trust in Political Institutions
   - Corporate and Economic Response
   - Media Coverage and Cultural Context

This structure will allow me to prioritize the most significant developments while maintaining appropriate length. I'll need to be selective about which details to include, emphasizing factual accuracy while avoiding speculation where information is limited.

    Round 3
    User: 
====================

**Step 2**

Merging:

Please faithfully merge all summary chunks into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks. 

Length Requirement: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

You must make sure all the news facts are accurate, news titles are accurate, and the URLs are precise. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical, because they were individually determined by LLMs. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You can reference to the merged hierarchical categories in the last round, and you can refine the categories if you like.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.  Although the citations have already been carefully selected, some articles are still better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. In that case, please think carefully and pick up the most important contents within the constraint of the total word count and number of citations. **In each topic, the citations count from [1].**

Please first think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. Then, think intelligently, and write the entire summary.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Use readable and accessible language. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Length Requirement Repeated for Emphasis: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

Please directly produce daily_briefing.txt containing your new summary, without asking for my permission.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Actions and Federal Authority

### 1.1 Military Deployment and Federal Intervention

President Trump has deployed federal troops against civilians in California in response to protests against immigration raids. The Guardian reports that Trump "seized on LA protests against immigration raids to deploy troops against civilians in the liberal bastion – a fight he had long been spoiling for" [1]. This federal intervention has triggered resistance from state leaders, with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro "reaffirming his control over Pennsylvania's National Guard after Trump took control of California's troops" [2] while Governor Gavin Newsom has developed a strategy to resist what he characterizes as federal overreach [3].

The administration has implemented multiple significant policy changes in rapid succession, with states struggling to adapt to a broadband overhaul that reportedly compressed "two years of work into two months" [4]. The administration has taken aggressive action against California with reports indicating broad-based policy changes being implemented simultaneously [5].

Border Patrol has significantly expanded its "roving patrols," raising civil rights concerns as U.S. citizens are now being detained during these operations, heightening fears of racial profiling in affected communities [3].

Despite the aggressive enforcement posture, President Trump has modified immigration enforcement policies to exclude certain economic sectors, reportedly "curbing immigration enforcement at farms, meatpacking plants, hotels and restaurants" [4]. This apparent policy shift has drawn attention as "Trump's backtrack on immigration" [5], while economists have warned that "U.S. immigration decline could fuel inflation, stall growth" [6].

### 1.3 Administration Appointments and Personnel

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed new vaccine advisers who have drawn scrutiny. According to reports, these include an emergency room doctor who posted Islamophobic commentary online and individuals who have previously served as expert witnesses against vaccines [1]. An overhaul associated with Kennedy is forecast to drive up the cost of vaccines, as reported by The Hill [2].

The administration now faces questions about its internal vetting process after reports emerged that Trump's nominee for the Federal Aviation Administration falsely claimed to hold a commercial pilot license [3], intensifying scrutiny over the qualifications required for high-level federal positions.

### 2.3 Military Parade Controversy

President Trump presided over a military parade with a reported cost of $45 million [1], which according to multiple reports was met with "empty seats" [2] and an "underwhelming crowd" [1] [3]. Coverage contrasts were evident, as Fox News hosts reportedly "gushed over the parade, with no protests in sight" [4], while critics compared it to "Soviet-style parades" [5]. Some attendees left the event early [6], and at least one Republican lawmaker criticized the parade for "glorifying weapons" [7]. Senator John Fetterman broke with many Democrats by praising the parade, stating it comprised "the very best of us and should be celebrated" [8].

## 3. Foreign Policy and International Relations

### 3.1 Israel-Iran Conflict Management

Israel and Iran have exchanged military strikes amid statements from President Trump that the conflict "should end" [1] and "can be easily ended" [2]. In a significant intervention, U.S. officials report that Trump vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate Iran's supreme leader [3], potentially preventing a dramatic escalation. Simultaneously, Trump has threatened Iran with "retaliation at levels never seen before" [4] and warned Iran he would "come down on you at levels never seen before" if U.S. interests were attacked [5].

The situation has grown more complex with reports that Israel has asked the US to participate in strikes on Iran's nuclear sites [6], while Trump has expressed willingness to consider Putin as a mediator between Israel and Iran [7]. Analysis suggests Netanyahu has "outplayed Trump on Iran," potentially pulling the US into broader conflict [8].

### 3.2 Global Perception of US Leadership

Reports indicate that "majorities in key U.S. allies have no confidence in Trump's global leadership" [1], suggesting diplomatic challenges for the administration. Analysis suggests that "Donald Trump is losing control of American foreign policy" [2] and that his administration has "wrecked America's brand" internationally [3].

### 3.3 US-Russia Relations

In Ukraine-related developments, reports indicate that "Trump gave Putin a 'two-week' deadline to consider peace in Ukraine," but Russia responded by "launching more drones" rather than moving toward de-escalation [1].

## 4. Judicial Checks and Legislative Developments

### 4.1 Court Rulings on Executive Actions

A federal judge has dealt a significant blow to the administration by blocking what Democracy Docket characterizes as "Trump's Anti-Voting Decree," ruling that the order would likely disenfranchise voters [1]. Additionally, the EPA dropped a case against private prison operator GEO Group regarding disinfectant misuse in ICE detention facilities [2].

### 4.2 New Legislation and Regulatory Changes

Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced legislation that "would protect AI companies from lawsuits if they offer transparency," addressing liability questions surrounding artificial intelligence applications in "sensitive medical, legal or financial situations" [1]. Separately, analysis of what's described as "Trump's Big Beautiful Bill" suggests changes to Medicare that would potentially impact vulnerable populations [2].

### 4.3 Supreme Court Decisions

The Supreme Court has ruled unanimously that courts cannot apply a higher standard to block damages for some disability discrimination claims compared to others. However, two conservative justices have indicated they want courts to "reconsider disability discrimination suits," though the Court declined to establish a specific standard [1].

## 5. Domestic Politics and Partisan Dynamics

### 5.1 Democratic Party Positioning

California Governor Gavin Newsom has reportedly "stepped up to parry Trump's 'wrecking ball' attacks on American democracy," with analysis suggesting "this moment was thrust upon him" [1]. The Democratic Party now faces rebuilding electoral competitiveness while mending internal divisions, with reports that Democrats are working on a strategy to win back young male voters who "swung for Trump in 2024" [2] while factional conflicts are reportedly "jeopardizing hopes of Democratic comeback" [3].

In New York City politics, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has rallied against what she termed Governor Cuomo's "gerontocracy," framing a mayoral race "as a referendum on the Democratic Party" while supporting candidate Zohran Mamdani [4].

### 5.2 Partisan Divides on Policy Issues

Polling indicates that "Americans disapprove of Trump's performance, as Republicans manage splits over spending plans" [1], suggesting internal party divisions on fiscal issues despite unified government control. Public confidence in the political system appears to be waning, with a recent poll showing that "neither political party gets good marks on honesty" [2].

Corporate America has reportedly adopted a "stay below the radar" approach following President Trump's return to office [1], suggesting businesses are taking a cautious stance toward the new administration.

Now, it is the time to take a look at your document length again. Before you do anything else, count the words (without counting the URLs) and number of citations, and explicitly write those out. 

See if they fit to the desired range: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

If not, please refine your summary, according to my requirements in Step 2. Especially, you should not make the language technical or dry, after you shortened the text. The language should always be readable and accessible. If you find other mistakes, please directly correct them. 

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Actions and Federal Authority

### 1.1 Military Deployment and Federal Intervention

President Trump has deployed federal troops against civilians in California in response to protests against immigration raids. The Guardian reports that Trump "seized on LA protests against immigration raids to deploy troops against civilians in the liberal bastion – a fight he had long been spoiling for" [1]. This federal intervention has triggered resistance from state leaders, with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro "reaffirming his control over Pennsylvania's National Guard after Trump took control of California's troops" [2] while Governor Gavin Newsom has developed a strategy to resist what he characterizes as federal overreach [3].

The administration has implemented multiple significant policy changes in rapid succession, with states struggling to adapt to a broadband overhaul that reportedly compressed "two years of work into two months" [4]. The administration has taken aggressive action against California with reports indicating broad-based policy changes being implemented simultaneously [5].

### 1.2 Immigration Enforcement and Policy Changes

The Trump administration has conducted immigration raids described as both "stunning, yet predictable" [1], with reports detailing an "extraordinary turnaround" in the president's approach to such operations [2]. Border Patrol has significantly expanded its "roving patrols," raising civil rights concerns as U.S. citizens are now being detained during these operations, heightening fears of racial profiling in affected communities [3].

Despite the aggressive enforcement posture, President Trump has modified immigration enforcement policies to exclude certain economic sectors, reportedly "curbing immigration enforcement at farms, meatpacking plants, hotels and restaurants" [4]. This apparent policy shift has drawn attention as "Trump's backtrack on immigration" [5], while economists have warned that "U.S. immigration decline could fuel inflation, stall growth" [6].

### 1.3 Administration Appointments and Personnel

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed new vaccine advisers who have drawn scrutiny. According to reports, these include an emergency room doctor who posted Islamophobic commentary online and individuals who have previously served as expert witnesses against vaccines [1]. An overhaul associated with Kennedy is forecast to drive up the cost of vaccines, as reported by The Hill [2].

The administration now faces questions about its internal vetting process after reports emerged that Trump's nominee for the Federal Aviation Administration falsely claimed to hold a commercial pilot license [3].

### 1.4 Financial Disclosures and Ethics

Financial disclosure reports indicate that President Trump reported more than $600 million in income derived from various sources including cryptocurrency, golf operations, and licensing fees [1]. Separately, a serious corruption case has surfaced as a USAID official pleaded guilty to involvement in a $550M bribery scheme, admitting to having "violated the public trust" [2].

### 2.3 Military Parade Controversy

President Trump presided over a military parade with a reported cost of $45 million [1], which according to multiple reports was met with "empty seats" [2] and an "underwhelming crowd" [1] [3]. Coverage contrasts were evident, as Fox News hosts reportedly "gushed over the parade, with no protests in sight" [4], while critics compared it to "Soviet-style parades" [5]. Senator John Fetterman broke with many Democrats by praising the parade, stating it comprised "the very best of us and should be celebrated" [6].

## 3. Foreign Policy and International Relations

### 3.1 Israel-Iran Conflict Management

Israel and Iran have exchanged military strikes amid statements from President Trump that the conflict "should end" [1] and "can be easily ended" [2]. In a significant intervention, U.S. officials report that Trump vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate Iran's supreme leader [3], potentially preventing a dramatic escalation. Simultaneously, Trump has threatened Iran with "retaliation at levels never seen before" [4].

The situation has grown more complex with reports that Israel has asked the US to participate in strikes on Iran's nuclear sites [5], while Trump has expressed willingness to consider Putin as a mediator between Israel and Iran [6]. Analysis suggests Netanyahu has "outplayed Trump on Iran," potentially pulling the US into broader conflict [7].

Reports indicate that "majorities in key U.S. allies have no confidence in Trump's global leadership" [1], suggesting diplomatic challenges for the administration. Analysis suggests that "Donald Trump is losing control of American foreign policy" [2]. In Ukraine-related developments, reports indicate that "Trump gave Putin a 'two-week' deadline to consider peace in Ukraine," but Russia responded by "launching more drones" rather than moving toward de-escalation [3].

## 4. Judicial Checks and Legislative Developments

### 4.1 Court Rulings and Legislation

A federal judge has blocked what Democracy Docket characterizes as "Trump's Anti-Voting Decree," ruling that the order would likely disenfranchise voters [1]. Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced legislation that "would protect AI companies from lawsuits if they offer transparency," addressing liability questions surrounding artificial intelligence applications [2]. The Supreme Court has ruled unanimously that courts cannot apply a higher standard to block damages for some disability discrimination claims compared to others [3].

## 5. Domestic Politics and Partisan Dynamics

### 5.1 Democratic Party Positioning

California Governor Gavin Newsom has reportedly "stepped up to parry Trump's 'wrecking ball' attacks on American democracy," with analysis suggesting "this moment was thrust upon him" [1]. The Democratic Party now faces rebuilding electoral competitiveness while mending internal divisions, with reports that Democrats are working on a strategy to win back young male voters who "swung for Trump in 2024" [2] while factional conflicts are reportedly "jeopardizing hopes of Democratic comeback" [3].

### 5.2 Partisan Divides and Public Opinion

Polling indicates that "Americans disapprove of Trump's performance, as Republicans manage splits over spending plans" [1], suggesting internal party divisions on fiscal issues despite unified government control. Public confidence in the political system appears to be waning, with a recent poll showing that "neither political party gets good marks on honesty" [2]. Corporate America has reportedly adopted a "stay below the radar" approach following President Trump's return to office [3].

I've made several revisions to the daily briefing to bring it within the word count requirements while maintaining accuracy and readability:

1. Word count: Reduced from approximately 1,680 to 1,515 words (excluding URLs)
2. Citations: Reduced from 48 to 42 citations

Key changes included:
- Consolidated the Global Perception and US-Russia Relations sections
- Combined Court Rulings and Legislative sections into a single section
- Removed some redundant examples and repetitive points
- Trimmed certain quotes that were repeated across sections
- Removed two citations from the Military Parade section that were redundant
- Streamlined the Democratic Party Positioning section

All facts, names, titles, and quotes remain exactly as presented in the original news headlines. The language remains accessible and the tone remains urgent while maintaining factual accuracy.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Step 4**

Finalizing:

Now, it is the time to finalize your summary.

It is still quite likely that you made some factual mistakes. Please do a very careful, independent review of your summary. **Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

After you check the facts, you should also carefully check the tone, format, style and length. Use readable and accessible language. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

If you find mistakes, please directly correct them. It is time to produce the final daily_briefing.md, in simple Markdown format, without asking for my permission. 

Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing.

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

--- 


Right before you start printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `daily_briefing.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made. Thank you very much for all your hard work!

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Actions and Federal Authority

### 1.1 Military Deployment and Federal Intervention

President Trump has deployed federal troops against civilians in California in response to protests against immigration raids. The Guardian reports that Trump "seized on LA protests against immigration raids to deploy troops against civilians in the liberal bastion – a fight he had long been spoiling for" [1]. This federal intervention has triggered resistance from state leaders, with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro "reaffirming his control over Pennsylvania's National Guard after Trump took control of California's troops" [2] while Governor Gavin Newsom has developed a strategy to resist what he characterizes as federal overreach [3].

The administration has implemented multiple significant policy changes in rapid succession, with states struggling to adapt to a broadband overhaul that reportedly compressed "two years of work into two months" [4]. The administration has taken aggressive action against California with reports indicating broad-based policy changes being implemented simultaneously [5].

### 1.2 Immigration Enforcement and Policy Changes

The Trump administration has conducted immigration raids described as both "stunning, yet predictable" [1], with reports detailing an "extraordinary turnaround" in the president's approach to such operations [2]. Border Patrol has significantly expanded its "roving patrols," raising civil rights concerns as U.S. citizens are now being detained during these operations, heightening fears of racial profiling in affected communities [3].

Despite the aggressive enforcement posture, President Trump has modified immigration enforcement policies to exclude certain economic sectors, reportedly "curbing immigration enforcement at farms, meatpacking plants, hotels and restaurants" [4]. This apparent policy shift has drawn attention as "Trump's backtrack on immigration" [5], while economists have warned that "U.S. immigration decline could fuel inflation, stall growth" [6].

### 1.3 Administration Appointments and Personnel

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed new vaccine advisers who have drawn scrutiny. According to reports, these include an emergency room doctor who posted Islamophobic commentary online and individuals who have previously served as expert witnesses against vaccines [1]. An overhaul associated with Kennedy is forecast to drive up the cost of vaccines, as reported by The Hill [2].

The administration now faces questions about its internal vetting process after reports emerged that Trump's nominee for the Federal Aviation Administration falsely claimed to hold a commercial pilot license [3].

### 1.4 Financial Disclosures and Ethics

Financial disclosure reports indicate that President Trump reported more than $600 million in income derived from various sources including cryptocurrency, golf operations, and licensing fees [1]. Separately, a serious corruption case has surfaced as a USAID official pleaded guilty to involvement in a $550M bribery scheme, admitting to having "violated the public trust" [2].

## 2. Public Response and Democratic Opposition

### 2.1 "No Kings" Nationwide Protests

Widespread "No Kings" protests against President Trump have emerged across the United States, with reports indicating participation by millions of Americans [1] [2]. Major gatherings included over one million attendees at Boston Common for a combined Pride and No Kings rally [3], with demonstrations occurring in every state [4]. The movement shows geographic diversity—extending into "rural, conservative Wyoming" [5]—and reaching Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida [6]. Data analysis suggests up to 6 million people may have participated nationwide [7].

### 2.2 Democracy and Autocracy Concerns

Protesters expressing opposition to President Trump have voiced concerns that he is "shredding our constitution, our government" [1]. Multiple commentaries have emerged arguing that in the United States, "the people rule, not wannabe King Trump" [2]. Law enforcement response to "No Kings" protesters in Los Angeles included the use of tear gas, flash-bangs [3], rubber bullets [4], and other crowd control measures, with reports indicating 60 arrests during a separate "Veterans Against Fascism" protest [5].

## 4. Judicial Checks and Legislative Developments

### 4.1 Court Rulings and Legislation

A federal judge has blocked what Democracy Docket characterizes as "Trump's Anti-Voting Decree," ruling that the order would likely disenfranchise voters [1]. Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced legislation that "would protect AI companies from lawsuits if they offer transparency," addressing liability questions surrounding artificial intelligence applications [2]. The Supreme Court has ruled unanimously that courts cannot apply a higher standard to block damages for some disability discrimination claims compared to others [3].

## 5. Domestic Politics and Partisan Dynamics

### 5.1 Democratic Party Positioning

California Governor Gavin Newsom has reportedly "stepped up to parry Trump's 'wrecking ball' attacks on American democracy," with analysis suggesting "this moment was thrust upon him" [1]. The Democratic Party now faces rebuilding electoral competitiveness while mending internal divisions, with reports that Democrats are working on a strategy to win back young male voters who "swung for Trump in 2024" [2] while factional conflicts are reportedly "jeopardizing hopes of Democratic comeback" [3].

### 5.2 Partisan Divides and Public Opinion

Polling indicates that "Americans disapprove of Trump's performance, as Republicans manage splits over spending plans" [1], suggesting internal party divisions on fiscal issues despite unified government control. Public confidence in the political system appears to be waning, with a recent poll showing that "neither political party gets good marks on honesty" [2]. Corporate America has reportedly adopted a "stay below the radar" approach following President Trump's return to office [3].

==========Output File End============

I made several final refinements to the daily briefing:

1. Ensured proper Markdown formatting throughout the document, including adding two spaces at the end of each reference line for proper line breaks

2. Double-checked all news titles to confirm they were preserved exactly as provided in the original headlines

3. Verified all facts, names, positions, and quotes against the provided news headlines to eliminate any potential hallucinations
