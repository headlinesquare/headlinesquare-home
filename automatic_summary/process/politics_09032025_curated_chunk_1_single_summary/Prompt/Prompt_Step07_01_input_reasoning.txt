**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.
