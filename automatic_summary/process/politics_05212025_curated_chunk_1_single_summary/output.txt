### 1.1 Deportation and Court Challenges

The administration faces allegations regarding deportations to South Sudan. Reports indicate Vietnamese and Burmese migrants were "illegally deported" to South Sudan [1], potentially violating court orders [2]. A judge has warned these deportations may breach existing orders [3] and has mandated U.S. officials "keep custody of migrants flown to South Sudan" [4].

The Department of Homeland Security has requested 20,000 National Guard troops for immigration enforcement operations [5], while expanding deportation targets to include new demographic groups [6]. Secretary Noem has claimed that habeas corpus gives her authority to "remove people from this country" [7], drawing criticism from those who say she "appears not to know what 'habeas corpus' means" [8].
