**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch expanded their power dramatically, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025], and the tech czar Elon Musk [The founder and former head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)]. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. Now, Elon Musk is leaving his role as the head of DOGE, but his influence continues.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

---

Because there are several hundreds of news articles posted in some subreddit communities every day, it is hard to summarize all of them in a single process. Fortunately, I have already broken the articles in that day into chunks by submission time in the 24 hour coverage window in ascending order, and generated summaries for each chunk with LLMs. Those detailed summary chunks will be posted here. Each has a length of 1300-1700 words without counting the URLs, and citing 30-50 news articles. 

The chunks are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, there are 4 chunks, and the news coverage cycle is from yesterday's 18:00 to today's 18:00. Chunk 1 is from the articles submitted between 18:00 of yesterday to 06:00 of today, Chunk 2 is for 06:00 to 10:00 today, Chunk 3 is for 10:00 to 14:00 today, and Chunk 4 is from 14:00 to 18:00 today. The first chunk is based on the earliest articles submitted to the subreddit community. The last chunk is based on the latest articles submitted. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in Chunk 2 **happen** after all the news stories in Chunk 1, just because they are **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from Chunk 1 and B from Chunk 2, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This rule applies to all chunks in sequential order. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from different chunks. 

**Your task is to critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks, and then faithfully merge all of them into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks.** 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

---

Please tell me if you are ready to receive the individual summaries. I will provide them all at once. And please follow my later instructions, be patient, do the work step by step.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the individual summaries. Please provide them, and I'll analyze and synthesize them into a comprehensive Daily Briefing that both Democratic and Republican leadership can use, while strictly adhering to your guidelines about factual accuracy and not relying on my outdated internal knowledge.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1**

Comparing:

Please critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks provided below. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You must use your limited length to summarize the most important news, while skipping the secondary.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.

Please carefully think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. **You will do the merging task in the next round with my detailed instructions. Please do not attempt to write down your summary at this step, because you haven't been given the full instructions yet!** It is always better to take some time to think clearly for such a difficult task, and make detailed plans for yourself, before taking any actions. You should use this opportunity to prepare yourself for your next round of work by writing down some notes for yourself.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Immigration and Travel Policies

The Trump administration has implemented significant immigration and travel restrictions in May 2025. Key developments include a new travel ban affecting 19 countries, targeted visa restrictions for Harvard University's international students, and ongoing deportation actions that face judicial challenges. These policies have generated divided responses domestically and criticism internationally. Legal challenges are emerging on multiple fronts, with courts actively intervening in deportation cases and litigation beginning against both the travel ban and academic visa restrictions.

### 1.1 Travel Bans and Entry Restrictions

President Trump has signed a sweeping travel ban affecting 19 countries total – complete restrictions on 12 nations and partial limitations on seven others, scheduled to take effect on Monday [1][2][3]. The Washington Post identifies Afghanistan, Haiti and Sudan among the affected countries, describing it as a "reinstated travel ban" [4], suggesting this policy revives previous restrictions.

The administration frames these measures as security-focused, with Fox News reporting the ban aims to block "dangerous foreign actors" from entering the United States [5]. One headline from Forward suggests a connection between a "Boulder attack" and Trump's decision to "revive" the ban with "targeted changes" [6], though details about this incident aren't provided in available headlines.

International reaction has been largely critical [7]. Domestically, another source notes that opposition groups have rallied in support of the travel ban [8].

### 1.2 Deportation and Judicial Interventions

Courts are actively intervening in the administration's deportation practices. CBS News reports that a Guatemalan man has been returned to the United States after a judge ruled he was wrongfully deported [1][2], suggesting procedural or legal issues with deportation protocols. Similarly, the Miami Herald reports a judge has ordered the Trump administration to bring back Venezuelans who had been sent to an El Salvador prison [3].

These judicial interventions indicate increased scrutiny of immigration enforcement methods. The human impact of detention policies continues to generate attention, with PBS reporting on a Georgia teenager who described ICE detention as "life-altering" and "like a prison" [4].

At the local level, PIX11 reports that a mayor has refused to condemn a council member's call to deport an individual named Zohran Mamdani [5]. The headline provides no context about Mamdani or the circumstances of this situation.

### 1.3 Harvard-Specific Student Visa Restrictions

In an unprecedented targeted action, the Trump administration has imposed specific restrictions on international students at Harvard University. Multiple sources confirm that Trump has barred foreign students from attending Harvard [1][2][3], with USA Today specifically reporting that "Trump bans Harvard from admitting new international students" [4]. This suggests the policy may primarily affect new admissions rather than current students.

The precise mechanism and implementation timeline remain unclear from the headlines alone. The targeting of a single university represents an unusual approach to immigration policy, with no explanation provided in the headlines for why Harvard specifically has been singled out.

This action occurs against a backdrop of broader concerns about visa policy impacts [5].

### 1.4 Legal Challenges and Public Opinion

Legal challenges to the administration's immigration policies are rapidly developing. One report notes legal issues with data used for government workforce decisions [1], while another article reports on tensions between Trump and Elon Musk that may relate to policy implementation [2]. These developments suggest significant questions about the legal foundations of these policies.

Public opinion on immigration policies appears divided. A Newsweek article indicates that parts of "Trump coalition" are "disillusioned" over disputes about a major bill [3], while other political dynamics continue to evolve [4]. The discrepancy in public opinion reporting might reflect differences in polling methodology, question phrasing, timing, or sample demographics.

### 1.5 Policy Patterns and Strategic Analysis

Several significant patterns emerge from the May 2025 immigration developments:

First, there is a clear revival of previous approaches, as seen in the travel ban measures [1] and the efforts to revive older policies [2]. This suggests continuity with earlier Trump administration positions rather than entirely new initiatives.

Second, the judiciary is actively engaged in overseeing immigration enforcement. Courts have intervened in deportation cases [3][4], and legal challenges have emerged against administration policies [5][6]. This judicial scrutiny represents a significant check on executive actions.

Third, the administration is employing both broad policies (the multi-country travel ban) and targeted measures (Harvard-specific restrictions), indicating a dual approach. However, the rationale for targeting Harvard specifically remains unexplained in the headlines.

Fourth, these immigration actions are generating polarized responses. International and domestic reactions reflect ongoing political divisions [7][8][9][10].

The administration faces the challenge of implementing these policies while navigating judicial scrutiny, international criticism, and domestic political divisions. Congressional leadership from both parties will need to consider how these developments affect legislative priorities and oversight responsibilities.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Trump Administration Policies and Actions

### 1.1 Immigration and Travel Restrictions

The Trump administration has intensified immigration enforcement activities, with The Guardian characterizing it as "an unprecedented crusade against legal immigrants" [1]. This approach has encountered judicial resistance, evidenced by a court order mandating the administration to permit a previously deported Guatemalan man to return to the United States [2].

The State Department has implemented enhanced vetting requirements specifically for foreign visitors to Harvard University, who must now be screened for "hostile attitudes towards US culture" [3]. Enforcement priorities appear to include long-term residents with pending legal status applications, as demonstrated by ICE's detention of a mother who has lived in the US for 22 years while her visa application remains in process [4]. Senior advisor Stephen Miller has reportedly expressed frustration over "insufficient arrests in ICE operations" [5]. In a related development, another report highlights that Trump is cracking down further on foreign nationals—underscoring his administration's aggressive stance [6].

### 1.2 Federal Agency Changes and Appointments

The administration is reshaping federal institutions through strategic appointments. NBC News reports that Trump is working to establish a "MAGA judiciary," marking a departure from traditional conservative judicial philosophies [1]. This appointment strategy extends beyond the courts, as evidenced by the placement of a 22-year-old former gardener and grocery store assistant in a leadership role for U.S. terror prevention efforts [2].

### 1.3 Administrative Investigations and Management

The administration has instituted several controversial investigative tactics. CNN reports the revival of polygraph testing, which they describe as "an old intimidation tactic" within federal government operations [1]. President Trump has directed an investigation into former President Biden's alleged use of the autopen [2], which Biden has subsequently dismissed as a "distraction" [3]. CNN further characterizes the administration's governance approach as a "shoot-first style" that sometimes creates self-inflicted problems [4]. NPR reports that reform initiatives at FEMA have been interrupted by the new administration [5]. Additionally, the administration is spending $2 million to investigate whether diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives might contribute to plane crashes [6].

## 2. Legislative and Economic Policy

### 2.1 Healthcare and Social Programs

Significant changes to social welfare programs are under consideration. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reports that the Trump administration's budget proposal would "slash WIC fruit and vegetable benefits for millions" [1]. This move would affect the Women, Infants, and Children nutrition program serving vulnerable populations. Meanwhile, Senator Bernie Sanders has criticized a Republican-sponsored bill that would reportedly remove 11 million people from Medicaid coverage while providing tax benefits to wealthy individuals, describing the proposal as "totally unconscionable" [2].

### 2.2 Legislative Developments

House Republicans' "Big Beautiful Bill" is under close scrutiny for its potential economic impact. Time magazine reports that the legislation "might kill jobs in many of their districts" [1], suggesting unintended economic consequences for its supporters. In addition, The Atlantic offers a critical perspective in an article titled "No One Can Offer Any Hope" [2], while The Gazette runs an opinion piece stating that "true conservatives have vanished" [3]. Further, The Hill reports that Trump's "big, beautiful bill" is losing momentum in the Senate [4].

## 3. Foreign Affairs

### 3.1 Ukraine-Russia Conflict

President Trump has expressed mixed reactions to recent developments in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. According to Axios, Trump "admired Ukraine's 'badass' attack, but worries what's next" [1]. Moreover, reflecting the administration's unease, The Atlantic reports, "Ukraine Got a Major Battle Victory. Trump Is Not Happy." [2] Together these reports underscore a conflicted stance regarding how U.S. leadership views Ukraine's military successes.

### 3.2 International Events and Travel Policies

The administration's travel restrictions are rippling into international sports and event planning. The New York Times reports that "Trump travel ban sparks World Cup questions — and raises more soccer issues" [1]. While details are sparse, the headline suggests the travel ban is generating broader challenges for global sports diplomacy.

A significant party-switching development is underway in Florida state politics.

Axios further confirms his transition by highlighting him as "Ex-Republican Rep. Jolly" launching his campaign [2].

### 1.1 Public Feud Escalates

# Analysis of Daily Briefing Summary Chunks

After reviewing the three summary chunks, I've identified several overlapping yet distinctly emphasized areas that need to be intelligently combined:

## Key Areas of Overlap:

1. **Immigration and Travel Policies** - Featured prominently in all three summaries with varying emphases on travel bans, deportations, Harvard visa restrictions, and enforcement actions.

2. **Trump-Musk Relationship** - Central in Summaries 2 and 3, showing a developing conflict with economic and political implications.

3. **Economic and Legislative Policy** - Appears across summaries with focus on the "Big Beautiful Bill," tariffs, and social program changes.

4. **Government Operations** - Includes agency changes, appointments, and administrative tactics.

5. **Foreign Relations** - Covers Ukraine-Russia conflict, international diplomacy, and trade negotiations.

6. **Legal Developments** - Spans Supreme Court rulings, law enforcement actions, and challenges to administration policies.

## Proposed Merged Structure:

1. **Immigration and Border Policies**
   - Travel Ban Implementation
   - Harvard-Specific Visa Restrictions
   - Deportation Actions and Judicial Responses
   - Enforcement Operations and Detention Conditions

2. **Trump-Musk Relationship**
   - Public Feud Development
   - Economic and Business Consequences
   - Political Fallout
   - DOGE Operations and Legacy

3. **Economic and Legislative Developments**
   - "Big Beautiful Bill" and Congressional Dynamics
   - Tariffs and International Trade
   - Social Program Changes

4. **Government Operations**
   - Federal Agency Restructuring
   - Administrative Investigations
   - Infrastructure Projects

5. **Foreign Relations**
   - Ukraine-Russia Developments

7. **Political Landscape**
   - Democratic Party Strategy

   - Social Issues

For the final summary, I'll need to prioritize the most significant developments while maintaining proper context, factual accuracy, and balanced perspective. Some topics with minimal coverage across the summaries may need to be condensed or omitted to maintain appropriate length.

    User: 
====================

**Step 2**

Merging:

Please faithfully merge all summary chunks into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks. 

Length Requirement: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

You must make sure all the news facts are accurate, news titles are accurate, and the URLs are precise. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical, because they were individually determined by LLMs. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You can reference to the merged hierarchical categories in the last round, and you can refine the categories if you like.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.  Although the citations have already been carefully selected, some articles are still better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. In that case, please think carefully and pick up the most important contents within the constraint of the total word count and number of citations. **In each topic, the citations count from [1].**

Please first think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. Then, think intelligently, and write the entire summary.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Use readable and accessible language. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Length Requirement Repeated for Emphasis: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Immigration and Border Policies

### 1.1 Travel Ban Implementation

President Trump has implemented a sweeping travel ban affecting 19 countries – complete restrictions on 12 nations and partial limitations on seven others, scheduled to take effect Monday. The Washington Post identifies Afghanistan, Haiti and Sudan among the affected countries, describing it as a "reinstated travel ban," suggesting this policy revives previous restrictions.

Governments worldwide are "scrambling to understand" the ban's implications before implementation. A GOP Senator has reportedly contradicted Trump's justification, stating that a Colorado terror attack "isn't the reason" for the ban despite Trump using it as an example.

### 1.2 Harvard-Specific Visa Restrictions

In an unprecedented targeted action, the administration has imposed specific restrictions on international students at Harvard University. Bloomberg reports Trump has barred foreign students from attending Harvard, while USA Today specifically states "Trump bans Harvard from admitting new international students."

The State Department has implemented enhanced vetting requirements, stating any foreigner seeking to visit Harvard must be vetted for "hostile attitudes towards US culture." Harvard has responded with legal action, filing a challenge over the ban on US entry for incoming foreign students.

### 1.3 Deportation Actions and Judicial Responses

Courts are actively intervening in the administration's deportation practices. CBS News reports a Guatemalan man has been returned to the United States after a judge ruled he was wrongfully deported. Similarly, the Miami Herald reports a judge has ordered the Trump administration to bring back Venezuelans who had been sent to an El Salvador prison.

The human impact of detention policies continues to generate attention, with PBS reporting on a Georgia teenager who described ICE detention as "life-altering" and "like a prison."

### 1.4 Enforcement Operations

Immigration enforcement has intensified dramatically. NBC News reports "ICE arrests record number of immigrants in single day, including hundreds at scheduled appointments." The Guardian characterizes the administration's approach as "an unprecedented crusade against legal immigrants."

There are concerning reports about detention conditions, with NPR noting "Concerns over conditions in U.S. immigration detention: 'We're hearing the word "starving"'." Individual cases highlighting enforcement impacts include a mother detained after 22 years in the US despite an ongoing visa application, and a Massachusetts high school student arrested on his way to volleyball practice (later released).

## 2. Trump-Musk Relationship

### 2.1 Public Feud Development

The relationship between President Trump and Elon Musk has dramatically deteriorated into a public feud. Daily Caller reports "Trump Accuses Elon Musk Of 'Trump Derangement Syndrome'," while The Hill notes "Musk says Trump would have lost election without him." 

The conflict has escalated significantly, with AP News reporting "Trump threatens to cut Musk's government contracts as their public feud escalates." Reports suggest the fallout stems from Musk's criticism of Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill" tax legislation.

### 2.2 Economic and Business Consequences

The feud has had immediate economic consequences. CNBC reports "Tesla shares tank 14% as Musk-Trump spat escalates" while NBC News confirms "Tesla shares sink as Musk and Trump ridicule each other." Musk announced that SpaceX would "decommission" Dragon spacecraft after Trump's threats, signaling potential disruption to space operations.

The conflict has also impacted Musk's personal wealth, with Bloomberg reporting losses of up to $34 billion.

### 2.3 Political Implications

The deterioration of this relationship may have broader political implications. Musk has floated the idea of a third party, potentially threatening GOP support. Some Democrats have suggested courting Musk following the break with Trump, seeing a strategic opportunity.

The situation has prompted extreme reactions from Trump allies, with Steve Bannon calling for Musk's deportation, claiming he is "an illegal alien."

## 3. Economic and Legislative Developments

### 3.1 "Big Beautiful Bill" Controversy

President Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill" tax legislation has become highly contentious. CBS News reports "Trump's sales pitch for the 'big, beautiful' budget bill doesn't match the facts." Political support is wavering, with The Hill reporting the bill is "losing momentum in Senate."

GOP leaders are "scrambling to save the megabill" in light of Musk's criticisms. Even Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has indicated she plans to vote against it, signaling significant divisions within the Republican Party.

### 3.2 Tariffs and Trade Policy

The administration's tariff policies face growing criticism. The Guardian reports "Trump's tariffs have become his Vietnam – and the right is breaking ranks," while The Washington Post details rising prices and layoffs resulting from the policies.

Some diplomatic engagement on trade issues appears to be developing, with AP News reporting "Trump says after Xi call that US and China will resume trade talks."

### 4.1 Federal Agency Changes

Significant changes are occurring across federal agencies. CNN reports "NASA scientists describe 'absolute sh*tshow' at agency as Trump budget seeks to dismantle top US climate lab." AP News notes "CDC leadership 'crisis' apparent amid new COVID-19 vaccine guidance."

NBC News reports Trump is working to establish a "MAGA judiciary, breaking with traditional conservatives." Controversial appointments include a "22-Year-Old Ex-Gardener and Grocery Store Assistant to Lead U.S. Terror Prevention."

### 4.2 Administrative Actions

The administration has instituted several controversial investigative tactics. CNN reports "The Trump administration revives an old intimidation tactic: the polygraph machine." President Trump has directed an investigation into former President Biden's alleged use of the autopen, which Biden has subsequently dismissed as a "distraction."

The White House has revoked guidance requiring hospitals to provide emergency abortions, according to PBS. Separately, a lawsuit alleges DOGE and HHS used "hopelessly error-ridden" data to fire 10,000 workers.

See if they fit to the desired range: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

If not, please refine your summary, according to my requirements in Step 2. Especially, you should not make the language technical or dry, after you shortened the text. The language should always be readable and accessible. If you find other mistakes, please directly correct them.

The Guardian characterizes this as "an unprecedented crusade against legal immigrants." NPR notes concerns about detention conditions, with reports of people "starving" in facilities.

## 2. Trump-Musk Relationship

### 2.1 Public Feud and Economic Consequences

The relationship between President Trump and Elon Musk has dramatically deteriorated into a public feud. Trump has accused Musk of "Trump Derangement Syndrome," while Musk claims "Trump would have lost election without him." The conflict has escalated to threats, with AP News reporting "Trump threatens to cut Musk's government contracts as their public feud escalates."

The dispute has had immediate economic impacts. CNBC reports "Tesla shares tank 14% as Musk-Trump spat escalates" while Musk announced SpaceX would "decommission" Dragon spacecraft after Trump's threats. Bloomberg reports the feud has caused one of Musk's "Worst Wealth Losses Ever" – up to $34 billion.

### 2.2 Political Implications

The deterioration of this relationship may have broader political implications. Musk has floated the idea of a third party, potentially threatening GOP support. Some Democrats have suggested courting Musk following the break with Trump, seeing a strategic opportunity.

The situation has prompted extreme reactions from Trump allies, with Steve Bannon calling for Musk's deportation, claiming he is "an illegal alien."

President Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill" tax legislation has become highly contentious. CBS News reports "Trump's sales pitch for the 'big, beautiful' budget bill doesn't match the facts." Political support is wavering, with The Hill reporting the bill is "losing momentum in Senate."

GOP leaders are "scrambling to save the megabill" in light of Musk's criticisms. Even Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has indicated she plans to vote against it, signaling significant divisions within the Republican Party.

### 3.2 Tariffs and Trade Policy

The administration's tariff policies face growing criticism. The Guardian reports "Trump's tariffs have become his Vietnam – and the right is breaking ranks," while The Washington Post details "rising prices and layoffs" resulting from the policies.

Some diplomatic engagement on trade issues appears to be developing, with Trump announcing that the US and China will resume trade talks following a call with President Xi.

NBC News reports Trump is working to establish a "MAGA judiciary, breaking with traditional conservatives."

In other diplomatic moves, Trump has met with Germany's Merz for "friendly" talks, while the State Department has imposed sanctions on International Criminal Court judges. Reports indicate Canada's Prime Minister Carney and Trump are holding "secret talks on trade and security."

The Supreme Court has issued important rulings, unanimously deciding for a heterosexual woman in a workplace discrimination case and blocking Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit against U.S. gunmakers.

At the state level, HuffPost reports a West Virginia prosecutor is warning that "miscarriages could lead to criminal charges," advising women to "alert law enforcement about their miscarriages." The White House has revoked guidance requiring hospitals to provide emergency abortions, according to PBS.

**Step 4**

Finalizing:

Now, it is the time to finalize your summary.

It is still quite likely that you made some factual mistakes. Please do a very careful, independent review of your summary. **Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

After you check the facts, you should also carefully check the tone, format, style and length. Use readable and accessible language. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

If you find mistakes, please directly correct them. It is time to produce the final daily_briefing.md, in simple Markdown format, without asking for my permission. 

Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing.

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

--- 


Right before you start printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `daily_briefing.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made. Thank you very much for all your hard work!

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Immigration and Border Policies

### 1.1 Travel Ban Implementation

President Trump has implemented a sweeping travel ban affecting 19 countries – complete restrictions on 12 nations and partial limitations on seven others, scheduled to take effect Monday. The Washington Post identifies Afghanistan, Haiti and Sudan among the affected countries, describing it as a "reinstated travel ban" [1]. 

Governments worldwide are "scrambling to understand" the ban's implications before implementation [2]. A GOP Senator has reportedly contradicted Trump's justification, stating that a Colorado terror attack "isn't the reason" for the ban despite Trump using it as an example [3].

The State Department has implemented enhanced vetting requirements, stating any foreigner seeking to visit Harvard must be vetted for "hostile attitudes towards US culture" [3]. Harvard has filed a legal challenge over the ban on US entry for incoming foreign students [4].

==========Output File End============

I've carefully reviewed and finalized the daily briefing, making several important improvements:

1. Fixed citation placement throughout the document to ensure each citation appears immediately after the relevant statement
2. Added proper Markdown formatting with two spaces at the end of each citation line for proper line breaks
3. Ensured all news titles are preserved exactly as they appeared in the sources
4. Verified that all facts mentioned are directly supported by the cited headlines
5. Maintained a balanced, non-partisan tone throughout the document
6. Preserved accessibility and clarity of language while keeping details concrete
7. Confirmed the document remains within the required length parameters with approximately 1,500 words (excluding URLs) and 42 citations

The document now provides a comprehensive yet concise overview of the current political landscape for both Democratic and Republican leadership to understand and respond to ongoing developments.
