The Trump administration faces intense scrutiny over the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador.

A federal judge criticized the administration's "fallacy" of "facilitation" word games in this case [3], while Vice President Vance [4] and Pam Bondi [5] defended the deportation, with Bondi stating the deportee is "not coming back to our country." President Trump defended his broader immigration agenda amid this controversy [6].

Meanwhile, DHS has reportedly sent notices to U.S. citizens instructing them to leave the country [2], including a U.S.-born immigration lawyer [3].
