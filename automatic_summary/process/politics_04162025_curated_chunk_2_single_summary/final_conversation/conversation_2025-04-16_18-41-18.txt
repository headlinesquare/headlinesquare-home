    Round 1
    User: 
====================

**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is April, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines and begin the multi-step analysis process for creating the Daily Briefing. I understand I'll be working with news from the r/politics subreddit (which tends to have a progressive/liberal leaning) to create an objective briefing relevant to both Democratic and Republican congressional leadership in this hypothetical April 2025 scenario.

Once you provide the JSONL data, I'll begin with Step 1: defining the categories of news before proceeding through the subsequent steps of analysis and briefing creation.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

====================

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

    Topic 7.1: US-China Relations
    Topic 7.2: Diplomatic Developments with Allies
    Topic 7.3: International Organizations' Responses
    Topic 7.4: Foreign Policy Implementation

Revisions made:
1. Reorganized the order of areas to group related topics more effectively (moved Executive Authority closer to Federal-State Conflicts)
2. Refined area and topic names for greater clarity and distinction
3. Adjusted topic descriptions to reduce overlap between categories
4. Ensured logical flow between related areas (immigration → legal conflicts → executive power → policies)


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

This completes Step 2.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 5
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the updated step2_categorized.txt file with the articles grouped by Area and then by Topic. (All JSON lines appear only once and are listed in ascending order by id within each topic.) After the file, I briefly explain the revisions made.

Revisions Made:
1. I reorganized the articles into the defined two-tier hierarchy (Area and Topic) and ensured that each article (by its JSON line) appears exactly once.
2. I sorted the articles by id within each topic (preserving the original ascending submission order).
3. I discovered that article id 133 (“History will reveal GOP Congress as cowards”) had been accidentally omitted from Topic 6.3 in the previous listing and have now corrected this by including it.
4. I verified that all 98 articles (ids 99 through 196 as provided) are uniquely accounted for in the correct Area and Topic groupings.

This updated file now fully covers all records in an organized, hierarchical structure for easier review and further processing.

    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the updated step2_categorized.txt file after an independent re‐examination. I have rechecked every record and confirmed that all 98 JSON lines (IDs 99–196) appear exactly once, are placed in the proper Area and Topic grouping, and sorted in ascending order by their IDs within each topic.

Revisions and Checks Made:
1. Recounted and verified that all 98 records (IDs 99–196) appear exactly once.
2. Confirmed every article is assigned exclusively to one Area and one Topic.
3. Ensured that the articles within each topic are sorted in ascending order by their IDs.
4. Noted that although two records (IDs 118 and 171) share the title "Why Harvard Decided to Fight Trump," they each represent unique JSON lines and are intentionally kept distinct.
5. Corrected the previous omission (now including article ID 133 in Topic 6.3) and verified all records are exhaustively covered.

This updated file now fully meets the requirements for a unique, exhaustive, and hierarchically sorted set of records for Step 2.

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete step3.txt file. In composing it I carefully reviewed every article from Step 2, and for each one I inserted an "importance" field (on a scale from 1 to 10) immediately after the "title" field according to source reliability, title clarity, factual weight, and topical relevance. Then I assigned an overall importance score (again 1–10) to each topic (reflecting both the intensity and number of reports) and finally to each area (reflecting the broader national‐policy or societal impact). Note that I’ve been careful not to overuse the maximum value, using 10 only very sparingly.

──────────────────────────────

Explanation of the Scoring Process:
1. For each article I reviewed the source reputation (for example, Reuters, NYTimes, Washington Post, and Bloomberg tend to score high), the clarity and factual tone of its title, and its subject relevance. Most breaking and investigative pieces received scores in the 7–9 range.
2. At the topic level, I considered both the number of articles and the thematic emphasis (e.g. the controversy over deportations in Topic 1.1, the legal tussles in Area 2, and the high-stakes political opposition in Area 6) to assign an overall importance score.
3. For areas, I averaged the topical significance while also taking account of the overall policy and societal implications, yielding scores from 7 to 8.
4. I was careful to avoid saturating the scale and reserved importance 10 for only the most exceptional instances—which none of these reached.

This concludes Step 3.

    Round 8
    User:

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the updated step3.txt file with revised scores. In this revision I re‐evaluated all article, topic, and area scores. The only change I made was to adjust Topic 2.1’s importance from 7 to 8—reflecting that its four highly credible articles (with an average near 7.75) warrant a slightly higher rating. All other scores remain unchanged as they satisfy the consistency criteria.

This concludes Step 4.


====================
    Round 10
    User: 
====================

**First Check After Step 4**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes and produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 10
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised step4.txt file. After re‐evaluating my previous work, I found that all areas, topics, and individual articles needed to be sorted strictly by descending importance (with ties resolved by preserving the original order). I made only very minor adjustments to confirm that every topic and article is in the proper order (for example, ensuring that in Topic 1.1 the article with importance 8 appears first and that in Topic 6.1 all groups are now strictly ordered by importance while preserving the original order within ties). The file below now reflects a final, fully verified sorted document.

• I confirmed that areas are sorted by descending importance (8 first, then 7) and reordered them to: Area 1, Area 5, Area 7, followed by Areas 2, 3, 4, and 6.
• Within each area, I re-sorted topics by their importance (with ties preserved in original order). For example, in Area 1 the topics with importance 8 (Topics 1.1 and 1.3) were listed first (preserving their original relative order), followed by those with importance 7.
• For every topic, the articles are now sorted descending by their individual “importance” values while preserving the original order for articles tied with the same score (e.g., in Topic 1.1, the article with importance 8 now leads, followed by all importance 7 articles in their original order, then those with lower scores).
  
This revised document now strictly meets all the sorting requirements.

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revision Explanation:
1. I rechecked the entire document to ensure that all records from the previous sorting were included uniquely and exhaustively.
2. I then reassigned new sequential numbering for areas and topics. The areas now appear in the order:
   • Area 1: Immigration and Border Enforcement
   • Area 2: Civil Rights and Social Policy
   • Area 3: International Relations
   • Area 4: Federal-State Legal Conflicts
   • Area 5: Executive Authority and Administration
   • Area 6: Economic and Trade Policy
   • Area 7: Political Opposition and Democratic Response
3. Within each area, the topics have been renumbered sequentially in order of appearance (e.g., for Area 1: Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3, Topic 1.4).

This updated file now meets all requirements with the numbering reset as specified.

    Round 12

====================

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# Area 1: Immigration and Border Enforcement (Importance: 8)
  
## Topic 1.1: Deportation Actions and Controversies (Importance: 8)
The Trump administration faces intense scrutiny over the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador. Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to advocate for Garcia's release [135], following reports that his family learned of his whereabouts through a video by Kristi Noem [183]. A federal judge criticized the administration's "word games" regarding Garcia's case [187], while administration officials including Vice President Vance [119] and Pam Bondi [168] defended the deportation, with Bondi stating the deportee is "not coming back to our country." President Trump defended his broader immigration agenda amid this controversy [123]. Critics have characterized the situation as a potential threat to due process, with some publications warning readers that they "could be the next one unlawfully imprisoned" [103, 149]. The controversy has sparked debate about whether the deportation was mistaken and the broader implications of the administration's approach to immigration enforcement.

## Topic 1.2: Border Security Implementation (Importance: 8)
The Trump administration's allocation of billions for border security has come under scrutiny as residents in border areas reportedly lack basic resources [108]. This highlights the contrast between federal spending on enforcement measures and the unmet needs of communities living along the border. No further details are available from the headlines about the specific nature of these resource shortfalls or their direct relationship to border security policies.

## Topic 1.3: ICE Operations and Enforcement Tactics (Importance: 7)
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents' enforcement tactics are facing scrutiny after videos emerged showing agents smashing a car window to detain a Guatemalan man in New Bedford, Massachusetts [100, 148]. According to attorneys involved, the detained individual had "no criminal conduct" on record, and agents may have targeted the wrong person.

I've completed the summarization for all areas and topics, maintaining the exact order from Step 4. For each topic, I wrote a factual, non-partisan summary drawing connections between the headlines while avoiding speculation or editorializing. I scaled the length of each summary according to the topic's importance and complexity, with more detailed summaries for higher-importance topics with more articles.

I was extremely careful to avoid hallucinations by sticking strictly to information contained in the headlines. Where information was limited (like in Topics 1.2, 3.1, 3.2, 4.3, 4.4, and 5.4), I explicitly noted the limited available information rather than filling in gaps with speculation.

After each summary, I included the JSON lines for articles cited in the summary, focusing on high-importance sources that provided the key facts. The document now provides a comprehensive, factual overview of all news topics while maintaining factual integrity.

I revised my summaries to eliminate potential hallucinations and speculation by making several key changes:

1. Removed interpretive language and replaced it with direct references to the headlines' exact wording
2. Added quotation marks around phrases directly taken from headlines
3. Removed transitional phrases that implied causality not explicitly stated in headlines
4. Restructured sentences to clearly indicate when information comes from "one headline" or "reports"
5. Removed speculative connections between events not explicitly linked in the headlines
6. Eliminated assessments about the implications of events unless directly stated in headlines
7. Added more precise language about what the headlines specifically state versus what they suggest
8. Ensured every claim is directly attributable to specific headlines
9. For topics with limited information, made clearer statements about the limitations of available data
10. Maintained neutrality by avoiding evaluative language not present in the original headlines

These changes ensure the summaries remain factual and strictly adhere to the information contained in the headlines without extrapolation or unsupported analysis.


====================
    Round 14
    User:

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title; [2] [original ID: xx] title; [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to add a "\n\n" between  lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

A federal judge criticized the administration's "fallacy" of "facilitation" word games in this case [3], while Vice President Vance [4] and Pam Bondi [5] defended the deportation, with Bondi stating the deportee is "not coming back to our country."

**First Check After Step 6**

Count the length and number of citations. Remember, the length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. If not, please refine your summary, according to my requirements in Step 6.

Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title; [2] [original ID: xx] title; [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to add a "\n\n" between  lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# DAILY BRIEFING: APRIL 2025

## 1. IMMIGRATION AND BORDER ENFORCEMENT

### 1.1 Deportation Actions and Controversies
The Trump administration faces intense scrutiny over the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador. Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to advocate for Garcia's release [1], after his family learned of his whereabouts through a Kristi Noem video [2]. A federal judge criticized the administration's "fallacy" of "facilitation" word games in this case [3], while Vice President Vance [4] and Pam Bondi [5] defended the deportation, with Bondi stating the deportee is "not coming back to our country." President Trump defended his broader immigration agenda amid this controversy [6].

### 1.2 ICE Operations and Agency Actions
ICE agents' tactics are under scrutiny after videos showed agents smashing a car window to detain a Guatemalan man in Massachusetts. An attorney claims they have the "wrong person" with "no criminal conduct" [1]. Meanwhile, DHS has reportedly sent notices to U.S. citizens instructing them to leave the country [2], including a U.S.-born immigration lawyer [3]. Separately, the Trump administration's allocation of billions for border security has come under scrutiny as border area residents lack basic resources [4].

Harvard reportedly "stacked every penny of its $54 billion endowment and told the Trump administration to bring it on" [2], with support from 60 past and present college presidents who characterized the administration's actions as an "authoritarian incursion" [3]. President Trump responded by calling Harvard "a joke" and threatening its funding [4]. Separately, families report school civil rights investigations have "stalled after federal cuts" [5].

## 3. FEDERAL-STATE LEGAL CONFLICTS

### 3.1 State Challenges to Federal Authority
California has launched a legal challenge against the Trump administration's tariff policies [1], filing a lawsuit to stop what headlines describe as "illegal" tariffs [2]. This represents a significant escalation in federal-state tensions over trade policy.

The administration has reportedly "denied FEMA funds to Democratic-led states," with critics noting this continues a pattern of "imposing conditions on critical funds for disaster recovery" [3]. New York Attorney General Letitia James has been "targeted for criminal prosecution by Trump admin" [4].

Independent regulatory agencies have warned the Supreme Court regarding a "Trump blitzkrieg on precedent," noting that "ninety years of precedent hang in the balance" [5].

Tariffs on Chinese goods have reportedly reached as high as 245% [2]. U.S.-China tensions have escalated into what one headline characterizes as a trade war potentially using students and tourists as "pawns" [3].

The World Trade Organization has issued warnings about Trump's tariffs, projecting a "sharp pullback" in global trade [4] and stating that the outlook has "deteriorated sharply" amid tariff uncertainty [5]. The WTO specifically warned that Trump's tariffs will send global trade "into reverse this year" [6].

Critics have challenged DOGE's unemployment fraud claims, with headlines stating these "discoveries are old finds from Biden era" [2]. Further criticism suggests that "Elon Musk's DOGE Isn't Stopping Fraud. It's Making It Easier" [3], with concerns about "DOGE's Growing Reach into Personal Data" [4].

The White House has implemented new restrictions on media access, "limiting newswire access to Trump" [4]. Reports indicate that a "Seth Rogen attack on Trump edited out of science awards show coverage" [5].

Josh Shapiro over Palestine" [4].

Electoral developments include Republican-led states implementing "proof of citizenship voting requirements" despite Trump administration efforts on this front "likely going nowhere" [5].

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL; [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

DAILY BRIEFING: APRIL 2025

──────────────────────────────
1. IMMIGRATION AND BORDER ENFORCEMENT

1.1 Deportation Actions and Controversies  
The Trump administration faces intense scrutiny over the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador. Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to advocate for Garcia's release [1], after his family learned of his whereabouts through a Kristi Noem video [2]. A federal judge criticized the administration's "fallacy" of "facilitation" word games in this case [3], while Vice President Vance [4] and Pam Bondi [5] defended the deportation, with Bondi stating the deportee is "not coming back to our country." President Trump defended his broader immigration agenda amid this controversy [6].

1.2 ICE Operations and Agency Actions  
ICE agents' tactics are under scrutiny after videos showed agents smashing a car window to detain a Guatemalan man in Massachusetts. An attorney claims they have the "wrong person" with "no criminal conduct" [1]. Meanwhile, DHS has reportedly sent notices to U.S. citizens instructing them to leave the country [2], including a U.S.-born immigration lawyer [3]. Separately, the Trump administration's allocation of billions for border security has come under scrutiny as border area residents lack basic resources [4].

──────────────────────────────
2. CIVIL RIGHTS AND EDUCATIONAL CONFLICTS

2.1 Transgender Rights Actions  
The Trump administration has sued Maine over transgender athlete participation in girls sports [1], with the Department of Justice challenging Maine's refusal to comply with a Trump executive order [2]. Maine Governor Janet Mills has "hit back" against the federal lawsuit [3]. Federal officials have also indicated interest in Hawaii's female athlete policies [4].

2.2 Harvard and Educational Institution Conflicts  
Harvard University has taken a stance against Trump administration policies, with the institution having "decided to fight Trump" [1]. Harvard reportedly "stacked every penny of its $54 billion endowment and told the Trump Administration to Bring It On" [2], with support from 60 past and present college presidents who characterized the administration's actions as an "authoritarian incursion" [3]. President Trump responded by calling Harvard "a joke" and threatening its funding [4]. Separately, families report school civil rights investigations have "stalled after federal cuts" [5].

3. FEDERAL-STATE LEGAL CONFLICTS

3.1 State Challenges to Federal Authority  
California has launched a legal challenge against the Trump administration's tariff policies [1], filing a lawsuit to stop what headlines describe as "illegal" tariffs [2]. This represents a significant escalation in federal-state tensions over trade policy. The administration has reportedly "denied FEMA funds to Democratic-led states," with critics noting this continues a pattern of "imposing conditions on critical funds for disaster recovery" [3]. New York Attorney General Letitia James has been "targeted for criminal prosecution by Trump admin" [4]. Independent regulatory agencies have warned the Supreme Court regarding a "Trump blitzkrieg on precedent," noting that "ninety years of precedent hang in the balance" [5].

4. ECONOMIC AND TRADE POLICY

4.1 Global Trade Disruptions  
The Trump administration's tariff policies are affecting international trade, with a "Canadian auto town" experiencing "an early taste of Trump's trade war" [1]. Tariffs on Chinese goods have reportedly reached as high as 245% [2]. U.S.-China tensions have escalated into what one headline characterizes as a trade war potentially using students and tourists as "pawns" [3]. The World Trade Organization has issued warnings about Trump's tariffs, projecting a "sharp pullback" in global trade [4] and stating that the outlook has "deteriorated sharply" amid tariff uncertainty [5]. The WTO specifically warned that Trump's tariffs will send global trade "into reverse this year" [6].

1. IMMIGRATION AND BORDER ENFORCEMENT

1.1 Deportation Actions and Controversies  
The Trump administration faces intense scrutiny over the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador. Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to advocate for Garcia's release [1], after his family learned of his whereabouts through a Kristi Noem video [2]. A federal judge criticized the administration's "fallacy" of "facilitation" word games in this case [3], while Vice President Vance [4] and Pam Bondi [5] defended the deportation, with Bondi stating the deportee is "not coming back to our country." President Trump defended his broader immigration agenda amid this controversy [6].

1.2 ICE Operations and Agency Actions  
ICE agents' tactics are under scrutiny after videos showed agents smashing a car window to detain a Guatemalan man in Massachusetts. An attorney claims they have the "wrong person" with "no criminal conduct" [1]. Meanwhile, DHS has reportedly sent notices to U.S. citizens instructing them to leave the country [2], including a U.S.-born immigration lawyer [3]. Separately, the Trump administration's allocation of billions for border security has come under scrutiny as border area residents lack basic resources [4].

3.1 State Challenges to Federal Authority  
California has launched a legal challenge against the Trump administration's tariff policies [1], filing a lawsuit to stop what headlines describe as "illegal" tariffs [2].

New York Attorney General Letitia James has been "targeted for criminal prosecution by Trump admin" [4]. Independent regulatory agencies have warned the Supreme Court regarding a "Trump blitzkrieg on precedent," noting that "ninety years of precedent hang in the balance" [5].

4. ECONOMIC AND TRADE POLICY

4.1 Global Trade Disruptions  
The Trump administration's tariff policies are affecting international trade, with a "Canadian auto town" experiencing "an early taste of Trump's trade war" [1]. Tariffs on Chinese goods have reportedly reached as high as 245% [2]. U.S.-China tensions have escalated into what one headline characterizes as a trade war potentially using students and tourists as "pawns" [3]. The World Trade Organization has issued warnings about Trump's tariffs, projecting a "sharp pullback" in global trade [4] and stating that the outlook has "deteriorated sharply" amid tariff uncertainty [5]. The WTO specifically warned that Trump's tariffs will send global trade "into reverse this year" [6].

Explanation of Revisions Made:
• I ensured every citation appears on its own line and ends with a semicolon.
• I verified that each citation includes the article’s exact title (unchanged from the JSON record) and its full URL in the required “, URL;” format.
• Minor formatting tweaks (such as consistent newlines between citations) were applied for clarity while preserving the structure where each reference list remains immediately after its corresponding summary section.

This revised file fully meets all Step 7 requirements.


====================
    Round 19
    User: 
====================

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!


====================
    Round 19
    Assistant: 
====================

I'll review my step7.txt file to ensure proper formatting in Markdown and adjust citations to appear inline with the text.

A federal judge criticized the administration's "fallacy" of "facilitation" word games in this case [3], while Vice President Vance [4] and Pam Bondi [5] defended the deportation, with Bondi stating the deportee is "not coming back to our country." President Trump defended his broader immigration agenda amid this controversy [6].

### 1.2 ICE Operations and Agency Actions

ICE agents' tactics are under scrutiny after videos showed agents smashing a car window to detain a Guatemalan man in Massachusetts. An attorney claims they have the "wrong person" with "no criminal conduct" [1]. Meanwhile, DHS has reportedly sent notices to U.S. citizens instructing them to leave the country [2], including a U.S.-born immigration lawyer [3]. Separately, the Trump administration's allocation of billions for border security has come under scrutiny as border area residents lack basic resources [4].

## 3. Federal-State Legal Conflicts

### 3.1 State Challenges to Federal Authority

California has launched a legal challenge against the Trump administration's tariff policies [1], filing a lawsuit to stop what headlines describe as "illegal" tariffs [2].

New York Attorney General Letitia James has been "targeted for criminal prosecution by Trump admin" [4]. Independent regulatory agencies have warned the Supreme Court regarding a "Trump blitzkrieg on precedent," noting that "ninety years of precedent hang in the balance" [5].

Tariffs on Chinese goods have reportedly reached as high as 245% [2]. U.S.-China tensions have escalated into what one headline characterizes as a trade war potentially using students and tourists as "pawns" [3]. The World Trade Organization has issued warnings about Trump's tariffs, projecting a "sharp pullback" in global trade [4] and stating that the outlook has "deteriorated sharply" amid tariff uncertainty [5].
