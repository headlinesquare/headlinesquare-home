# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Congressional and Legislative Affairs

### 1.1 Proposed Legislation

Congress faces critical decisions on multiple war powers resolutions amid escalating Middle East tensions. S.J.Res.59 seeks to direct removal of U.S. forces from unauthorized hostilities with Iran [1], while Senator Sanders has introduced legislation to prohibit using federal funds for what he terms an "illegal war with Iran" [2]. In addition, a new bill has been introduced – (see citation [3]) – and a bipartisan proposal for federal contracts oversight is noted [4]. Of urgent concern to California stakeholders, a Republican bill could potentially open 16 million acres of public lands for sale [5].

### 1.3 House Activities

Legislation (S.2085) has been introduced requiring 12-month continuous, full benefit coverage for pregnant individuals under both Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) [1]. Although details are sparse beyond the core provision, the bill appears aimed at addressing crucial gaps in healthcare coverage for expectant mothers.

## 3. Civil Unrest and Political Violence

### 3.1 Political Violence Incidents

Law enforcement has arrested an armed individual at Nashville's "No Kings" protest who reportedly had a long-standing fascination with Nazis and mass murder [1]. This intervention potentially averted further escalation at a politically charged demonstration.

Immigration enforcement has abruptly intensified as the Department of Homeland Security reverses earlier restrictions—allowing ICE raids to resume at farms, hotels, and restaurants [1, 2]. Small business owners in Los Angeles report severe economic impacts from these renewed actions, with some comparing the damage to that experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic [3]. In another development, ICE is moving to deport an Atlanta-based Hispanic reporter who covered immigration raids [4].
