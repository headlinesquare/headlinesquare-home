    Round 1
    User: 
====================

**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

---

Because there are several hundreds of news articles posted in some subreddit communities every day, it is hard to summarize all of them in a single process. Fortunately, I have already broken the articles in that day into chunks by submission time in the 24 hour coverage window in ascending order, and generated summaries for each chunk with LLMs. Those detailed summary chunks will be posted here. Each has a length of 1300-1700 words without counting the URLs, and citing 30-50 news articles. 

The chunks are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, there are 4 chunks, and the news coverage cycle is from yesterday's 18:00 to today's 18:00. Chunk 1 is from the articles submitted between 18:00 of yesterday to 06:00 of today, Chunk 2 is for 06:00 to 10:00 today, Chunk 3 is for 10:00 to 14:00 today, and Chunk 4 is from 14:00 to 18:00 today. The first chunk is based on the earliest articles submitted to the subreddit community. The last chunk is based on the latest articles submitted. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in Chunk 2 **happen** after all the news stories in Chunk 1, just because they are **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from Chunk 1 and B from Chunk 2, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This rule applies to all chunks in sequential order. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from different chunks. 

**Your task is to critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks, and then faithfully merge all of them into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks.** 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

---

Please tell me if you are ready to receive the individual summaries. I will provide them all at once. And please follow my later instructions, be patient, do the work step by step.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the individual summaries. Please provide them all at once, and I'll analyze and merge them into a comprehensive daily briefing that both Democratic and Republican leadership can use to understand the current situation in this hypothetical May 2025 scenario. I'll carefully consider the sources, assess factual claims, identify potential biases, and synthesize the information into an objective analysis.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1**

Comparing:

Please critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks provided below. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You must use your limited length to summarize the most important news, while skipping the secondary.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.

Please carefully think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. **You will do the merging task in the next round with my detailed instructions. Please do not attempt to write down your summary at this step, because you haven't been given the full instructions yet!** It is always better to take some time to think clearly for such a difficult task, and make detailed plans for yourself, before taking any actions. You should use this opportunity to prepare yourself for your next round of work by writing down some notes for yourself.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Trump Administration Executive Actions

### 1.1 Federal Funding Decisions and Budget Cuts

The Trump administration has enacted significant funding restrictions targeting research institutions and cultural programs. Harvard University faces multiple punitive measures, including an $8 billion pause on grant funding [1] and being barred from new federal research funding [2] until meeting unspecified presidential demands [3]. Beyond higher education, the National Institutes of Health has laid off hundreds of staff, including at cancer research institutes [4], while the National Endowment for the Arts is sending grant terminations as Trump's budget proposes shuttering the agency [5]. The administration has also cut the 'Safe to Sleep' infant safety team [6].

### 1.2 Executive Orders and Presidential Communications

The president has issued directives affecting justice policy and regulatory frameworks, including directing the Department of Justice to attempt to free Tina Peters from prison via social media [1] and pulling back from school desegregation efforts in Louisiana [2]. Presidential rhetoric continues generating attention, with Trump denying posting an AI-generated image of himself as Pope [3] and having "changed his tune on the economy" [4]. His order to reopen Alcatraz prison [5] has drawn mixed public reactions from calling Trump "a moron" to saying the "idea seems good" [6], with critics alleging he is "stealing his policy ideas from TV" [7].

## 2. Immigration Enforcement and Border Security

### 2.1 Detention Conditions and Deportation Operations

Immigration enforcement has intensified with concerning humanitarian implications. Seven migrants have died in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody during Trump's first 100 days [1], raising significant questions about detention conditions. The administration has reportedly deported individuals previously protected by legal settlements [2] while negotiating with Rwanda to accept deportees [3], which Rwandan officials have confirmed [4]. 

A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to admit approximately 12,000 refugees [5], presenting a significant judicial challenge to refugee admission restrictions. Border security measures have intensified, with worsening cross-border travel from British Columbia to Washington state [6] and U.S. Border Agents requesting help photographing everyone entering the country by car [7].

## 3. Legal Challenges and Judicial Oversight

### 3.1 Justice Department Positions and Court Interventions

The Trump Justice Department has taken notable positions on reproductive rights cases, urging a judge to dismiss states' lawsuits over access to the abortion pill mifepristone [1] while committing to defend Biden-era abortion pill rules in a Texas case [2]. These positions demonstrate policy continuity on specific issues despite broader differences between the administrations.

Judicial intervention has emerged in electoral processes, with a federal judge ordering North Carolina to certify Democrat Allison Riggs as winner in a state Supreme Court election [3]. In Michigan, the Attorney General has dropped all charges against seven pro-Palestinian protesters [4], reflecting tensions between protest activities and law enforcement in politically sensitive contexts.

## 4. Domestic Politics and Governance

### 4.1 Congressional Activities and Political Opposition

Former Vice President Mike Pence has publicly diverged from President Trump on tariffs, Russia relations, and potential January 6 pardons [1], specifically rebuking Trump over tariffs and "wavering" support for Ukraine [2]. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has declined to seek the top Democratic position on the House Oversight Committee [3], citing deference to seniority.

Opposition to the administration manifests through multiple channels. Former Palantir employees have condemned the company's work with the Trump administration [4], while Senator Bernie Sanders stated that "resisting Trump is 'not good enough'" [5]. Publications have examined how "Republicans in Congress enable Trump's tyranny" [6], while a former official claims Trump is trying to silence critics [7]. 

At the state level, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has declined to run for Senate despite private lobbying [8], while a Maryland town that supported Trump's cost-cutting pledge has reportedly become a target of those same policies [9].

## 5. International Relations and National Security

### 5.1 Defense Policy and Global Conflicts

Defense Secretary Hegseth has initiated significant structural changes, directing a 20% reduction in top military leadership positions [1] as part of slashing the military's senior-most ranks [2]. In a move that reportedly surprised the White House, Hegseth issued an order to cancel Ukraine weapons deliveries [3], indicating potential policy discord within the administration. 

The Israel-Palestine conflict continues to intensify. Israel has approved a plan to capture all of Gaza and called up tens of thousands of reserve troops [4], while U.S. public opinion has shifted, with reports that "Americans used to be steadfast in their support for Israel. Those days are gone" [5]. An Israeli news investigation claims the Biden administration did not try to end what the source characterizes as genocide in Gaza [6].

In U.S.-Russia relations, Polish President Andrzej Duda has called on Trump to pressure Russia with "economic instruments" [7], while former Vice President Pence emphasized that "Putin doesn't want peace, he wants Ukraine" while rebuking Trump's stance on Russia [8].

## 6. Economic and Trade Policies

### 6.1 Tariffs and Business Impacts

Trump's tariff policies are affecting businesses, consumers, and international relations. A used car business in Oklahoma is "already straining" from the tariffs [1], while wedding dress retailers face higher costs due to China tariffs, threatening small shops [2]. Financial analysts are questioning how much the tariffs will cost American families [3], as The Guardian characterizes warehouse and transport workers as "the first victims of a class war" from Trump's "shock therapy" [4].

International trade tensions have grown as Japan walks "a delicate tightrope between US and China" [5], with Japan's finance minister calling U.S. Treasury holdings "a card" in tariff talks [6]. The administration is expected to announce pharmaceutical tariffs "in next two weeks" [7] and has called for a 100% tariff on foreign films shortly after actor Jon Voight proposed "limited" tariffs [8]. This has prompted California Governor Gavin Newsom to ask Trump to work with him on a $7.5 billion tax credit for Hollywood [9], promoting the slogan "Make America Film Again" [10].

### 7.1 Media, Cultural Policies, and Education

Cultural and media issues have emerged on multiple fronts. Republican lawmakers are seeking to ban Pride flags, stirring tensions with liberal cities [1], while former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, once a same-sex marriage champion, is reportedly not courting LGBTQ+ votes now [2]. 

Free speech concerns have arisen internationally, with reports that Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, described as a Trump ally, is reportedly set to arrest journalists who revealed his alleged secret pact with gangs [3]. Trump's attack on the film industry has been characterized as "a sign of xenophobic contempt" [4], while educational programming faces potential cuts with reports that children's shows on PBS, including Mister Rogers and Sesame Street, which teach empathy, may lose funding under Trump's proposed budget [5].

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Trump Administration Executive Actions

### 1.1 Presidential Power and Democratic Institutions
Concerns about executive overreach are mounting in the early Trump administration. The Atlantic highlights "Elon Musk's Most Alarming Power Grab" [1] in his role heading the Department of Government Efficiency. Salon characterizes Trump's first 100 days as unusually aggressive in "A free fall not seen in modern history": 100 days of destruction. Trump has been more aggressive in his efforts to destroy democracy than any other autocrat in recent decades [2]. Reports indicate Republicans have remained silent following Trump's refusal to commit to upholding the Constitution [3]. His approval ratings show mixed signals, with Newsweek reporting potential vulnerability with "Donald Trump's Approval Rating is Showing Cracks in His Base" [4], while conservative-leaning Newsmax highlights that Trump has "Rasmussen: Trump Bumps Up to 50 Percent Approval" [5].

### 1.2 Executive Actions and Presidential Communication
Trump's executive actions have sparked controversy, including the potential reopening of Alcatraz [1] and an order critics say will "turbocharge police violence" [2]. His communication patterns reveal a continued focus on his predecessor, with "Biden" among his most frequently used words [3]. The Washington Post notes Trump has called for "wartime sacrifices" from Americans while apparently exempting himself [4]. Religious sensitivities were triggered when Trump dismissed concerns about his AI-generated pope image, saying critics "can't take a joke" while claiming "Catholics loved it" [5].

## 2. Economic and Trade Policy

### 2.1 Tariff Implementation and Effects
President Trump's tariff policies are having significant economic consequences. Bloomberg quantifies one example: "One Ship, $417 Million in New Tariffs: The Cost of Trump's Trade War" [1]. CNN reports ships carrying Chinese goods subject to 145% tariffs are arriving in Los Angeles "half-full," with shortages expected soon [2]. CNBC reports the "Trump trade tariffs slump widens to 'nearly all U.S. exports,' supply chain data shows" [3], while the Washington Post notes a shift in presidential messaging "from prosperity to austerity" as tariff impacts loom [4].

# Step 1 Analysis: Comparing Summary Chunks

After analyzing the three summary chunks, I've identified overlapping areas and topics that need to be intelligently combined to create a comprehensive daily briefing. This analysis will inform my merging strategy in the next step.

## Key Hierarchical Areas and Topics Across Summaries

### 1. Executive Branch Actions and Power
- Presidential communications and directives (appear in all summaries)
- Elon Musk and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) (mentioned most prominently in Summary 2)
- Federal funding decisions and budget cuts (detailed in Summary 1, continued in others)
- Agency leadership controversies (particularly Hegseth in Summary 3)

### 2. Economic and Trade Policies
- Tariff implementation and international reactions (extensive coverage in Summary 2)
- Business and consumer impacts (varying details across all summaries)
- International trade negotiations and responses (EU, Canada, Japan, etc.)
- Presidential rhetoric shifts on trade deals (noted in Summary 3)

### 3. Immigration Enforcement
- Deportation operations and controversies (covered differently across summaries)
- Detention conditions and humanitarian concerns (Summary 1)
- Legal challenges to immigration policies (all summaries, different emphases)
- International deportation agreements (Rwanda, Ukraine mentions)

### 4. National Security and Defense
- Pentagon leadership issues (especially Hegseth in Summary 3)
- Military aid to Ukraine controversies (appears in multiple summaries)
- Israel-Palestine conflict updates (Summary 1)
- Transgender military ban (Summary 3)
- Yemen policy shift (Summary 3)

### 5. International Relations
- US-Canada tensions (extensive in Summary 3, mentioned in Summary 2)
- European relations (varied coverage across summaries)
- Russia-related policies (mentioned briefly in multiple summaries)

### 6. Legal Challenges and Judicial Oversight
- Court interventions on executive actions (all summaries)

- Civil rights and constitutional concerns (multiple mentions)

### 7. Domestic Politics and Opposition
- Congressional activities and resistance (varied across summaries)

- State-level political developments (different emphases)

### 8. Environmental and Social Policy
- Environmental protection rollbacks (Summary 2)
- Cultural and educational program cuts (Summary 1)
- Social divisions and LGBTQ+ issues (varying coverage)

## Merging Strategy Notes

1. I'll need to prioritize the most significant developments in each area, particularly those that illustrate the expansion of executive power (central to the May 2025 scenario).

2. Areas that require significant attention:
   - DOGE and Musk's role (central to the prompt scenario)
   - Major funding decisions and agency restructuring
   - Immigration enforcement controversies 
   - US-Canada relations deterioration
   - Defense policy controversies
   - Significant judicial challenges

3. Areas where I can be more selective:
   - State-level politics (focus on those with national implications)
   - Minor congressional activities
   - Secondary international relations points

4. Structure will follow the hierarchical areas identified above, with subsections organized by significance and thematic connection rather than strictly by source summary.


====================
    Round 3
    User: 
====================

**Step 2**

Merging:

Please faithfully merge all summary chunks into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks. 

Length Requirement: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

You must make sure all the news facts are accurate, news titles are accurate, and the URLs are precise. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical, because they were individually determined by LLMs. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You can reference to the merged hierarchical categories in the last round, and you can refine the categories if you like.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.  Although the citations have already been carefully selected, some articles are still better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. In that case, please think carefully and pick up the most important contents within the constraint of the total word count and number of citations. **In each topic, the citations count from [1].**

Please first think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. Then, think intelligently, and write the entire summary.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Use readable and accessible language. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Length Requirement Repeated for Emphasis: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

Please directly produce daily_briefing.txt containing your new summary, without asking for my permission.

Length Control:

Now, it is the time to take a look at your document length again. Before you do anything else, count the words (without counting the URLs) and number of citations, and explicitly write those out. 

See if they fit to the desired range: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

If not, please refine your summary, according to my requirements in Step 2. Especially, you should not make the language technical or dry, after you shortened the text. The language should always be readable and accessible. If you find other mistakes, please directly correct them. 

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

You should produce the new daily_briefing.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

I have revised the daily briefing to meet the length requirements. The current version contains approximately 1,600 words (excluding URLs) and 44 citations, which falls within the requested range of 1,300-1,700 words and 30-50 citations.

Major revisions included:
1. Consolidating redundant information across sections
2. Removing some less critical details while preserving core facts
3. Reducing the number of citations by selecting the most authoritative sources
4. Merging related topics for more efficient coverage
5. Creating a more focused section on Israel-Palestine conflict
6. Maintaining accessible language while enhancing conciseness

The revised briefing maintains the urgency and factual focus of the original while adhering to the length constraints.

**Step 4**

Finalizing:

Now, it is the time to finalize your summary.

It is still quite likely that you made some factual mistakes. Please do a very careful, independent review of your summary. **Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the individual summary chunks. 

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

After you check the facts, you should also carefully check the tone, format, style and length. Use readable and accessible language. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

If you find mistakes, please directly correct them. It is time to produce the final daily_briefing.md, in simple Markdown format, without asking for my permission. 

Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing.

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

--- 


Right before you start printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `daily_briefing.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made. Thank you very much for all your hard work!

## 4. National Security and Defense

### 4.1 Pentagon Leadership and Military Policies

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth faces mounting controversies over Ukraine policy. Reports indicate he halted weapons shipments to Ukraine without properly informing President Trump [1], while using the Signal messaging app to communicate sensitive military plans to other countries [2].

The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration authority to implement its ban on transgender individuals serving in the military [3]. President Trump has announced the cessation of U.S. bombing operations against Yemen's Houthi rebels after the group pledged to stop targeting ships in the region [4]. Former Vice President Mike Pence has publicly rebuked Trump over "wavering" support for Ukraine [5], emphasizing that "Putin doesn't want peace, he wants Ukraine" [6].

### 4.2 Israel-Palestine Conflict

Israel-Palestine conflict continues to intensify. Israel has approved a plan to capture all of Gaza and called up tens of thousands of reserve troops [1]. U.S. public opinion on the conflict has shifted, with the BBC reporting that "Americans used to be steadfast in their support for Israel. Those days are gone" [2]. An Israeli news investigation claims the Biden administration did not try to end what the source characterizes as genocide in Gaza [3].

## 5. US-Canada Relations and International Diplomacy

A White House meeting between President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney revealed significant tensions. Trump suggested Canada could become part of the United States, prompting Carney to respond that "Canada is not for sale" [1] and reportedly whispering "never, never, never" [2]. Trump replied "Never say never" [3]. Carney publicly rebuked Trump's statements about U.S.-Canada trade during their Oval Office appearance [4].

The Guardian warns Trump "is destroying" America's "greatest strategic advantage" of "friendly neighbors" [5]. Europe has launched "a drive to attract scientists and researchers after Trump freezes US funding" [6], potentially accelerating a brain drain. Kentucky bourbon exports are at risk as Trump-Canada trade tensions escalate [7].
