**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

---

Because there are several hundreds of news articles posted in some subreddit communities every day, it is hard to summarize all of them in a single process. Fortunately, I have already broken the articles in that day into chunks by submission time in the 24 hour coverage window in ascending order, and generated summaries for each chunk with LLMs. Those detailed summary chunks will be posted here. Each has a length of 1300-1700 words without counting the URLs, and citing 30-50 news articles. 

The chunks are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, there are 4 chunks, and the news coverage cycle is from yesterday's 18:00 to today's 18:00. Chunk 1 is from the articles submitted between 18:00 of yesterday to 06:00 of today, Chunk 2 is for 06:00 to 10:00 today, Chunk 3 is for 10:00 to 14:00 today, and Chunk 4 is from 14:00 to 18:00 today. The first chunk is based on the earliest articles submitted to the subreddit community. The last chunk is based on the latest articles submitted. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in Chunk 2 **happen** after all the news stories in Chunk 1, just because they are **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from Chunk 1 and B from Chunk 2, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This rule applies to all chunks in sequential order. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from different chunks. 

**Your task is to critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks, and then faithfully merge all of them into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks.** 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

---

Please tell me if you are ready to receive the individual summaries. I will provide them all at once. And please follow my later instructions, be patient, do the work step by step.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the individual summary chunks. I understand I'll need to analyze them critically, identify patterns and developments across them, and create a comprehensive daily briefing that maintains factual accuracy while serving both Democratic and Republican leadership. 

Please provide the summaries, and I'll process them thoroughly to create a balanced, informative briefing appropriate for the May 2025 political context you've described.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1**

Comparing:

Please critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks provided below. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You must use your limited length to summarize the most important news, while skipping the secondary.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.

Please carefully think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. **You will do the merging task in the next round with my detailed instructions. Please do not attempt to write down your summary at this step, because you haven't been given the full instructions yet!** It is always better to take some time to think clearly for such a difficult task, and make detailed plans for yourself, before taking any actions. You should use this opportunity to prepare yourself for your next round of work by writing down some notes for yourself.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Trump Administration Actions

### 1.1 Administrative Reshaping and Personnel Changes  
The White House has dismissed "scores of National Security Council staff" [1], dramatically reducing this critical advisory body. Simultaneously, career foreign service veterans are reportedly being replaced with loyalists at the State Department in what critics characterize as the formation of a "Maga deep state" [2]. This represents a substantial reshaping of national security and diplomatic institutions.

### 1.2 Presidential Business Interests  
Multiple reports indicate the Trump family is leveraging presidential power for business gain. Vietnamese authorities "ignored their own laws to fast-track a Trump Family Golf Complex" [1], while broader reporting indicates the family is actively "monetizing the presidency" with profits that "outstrip protests" [2]. Specific controversies include a "corrupt meme coin dinner" prompting lawmakers to demand transparency about attendees and potential favors [3], and a reported $300 million purchase of "Trump memecoin" by "a Chinese company with no revenue" [4]. Critics have raised concerns about potential conflicts involving the "Golden Dome" project that "won't work—but it'll make Elon Musk richer" [5].

### 1.3 White House Communication Approach  
During a commencement address at West Point, President Trump delivered what was characterized as a "rally-style speech" criticizing DEI policies [1]. The speech included comments suggesting confusion about stealth technology in military aircraft, with the President apparently maintaining that stealth jets are "literally invisible" [2]. Separately, the administration has implemented stricter loyalty requirements, with observers noting that "only the most loyal are allowed in" [3].

## 2. Economic and Fiscal Policy

### 2.1 Tariffs and Trade Policy  
President Trump's tariff policies are generating significant economic uncertainty. Recent "new tariff threats" indicate trade uncertainty will persist [1], while analysis shows the administration is "pivoting from tax cuts to tariffs" while reportedly "ignoring economic warning signs" [2]. Critics argue these "big, beautiful tariffs" will "make us all poorer" [3]. The impact is beginning to materialize as furniture prices rise—"your new sofa could be the first sign tariff inflation is hitting home" [4]—and multiple companies announce plans to raise prices directly in response [5].

### 2.2 Manufacturing and Budget Priorities  
The administration's manufacturing agenda faces significant challenges. While President Trump wants to "create manufacturing jobs," his "tech allies invest in robots to do the work" [1], highlighting tensions between political rhetoric and business realities. Specific manufacturing challenges include "little, little screws" presenting "hurdles to US-made iPhones" [2].

Budget priorities show significant shifts. Scientific research faces substantial cuts, as "scientists have lost their jobs or grants in US cuts" with some being recruited by "foreign universities" [3]. In contrast, Trump reportedly "brags that he's 'not cutting 10 cents' from Pentagon" even as the "GOP guts Medicaid" [4], indicating a clear shift in federal funding priorities.

## 3. Legal and Judicial Tensions

### 3.1 Executive-Judicial Conflict  
Tensions between the judicial branch and Trump administration are escalating significantly, characterized as an "all-out war" between Trump and the courts [1]. Legislative action appears to support this conflict, as "Republicans snuck a provision into their megabill that would let Trump defy the courts" [2]. Specific court rulings against the administration include a judge ordering "the Trump administration to return wrongly deported gay man" [3]. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) secured a temporary reprieve in a records disclosure case, as "John Roberts helps DOGE avoid turning over records for now in CREW litigation" [4].

### 3.2 Judicial Security and Independence  
Federal judges are considering unprecedented measures to secure their own protection amid growing threats. Reports indicate "judges weigh taking control of their own security amid threats" [1] because U.S. Marshals "ultimately answer to President Trump, who has ramped up criticism of the judiciary" [2]. This represents a significant challenge to traditional arrangements for judicial security and raises questions about judicial independence.

## 4. Domestic and Social Policy

### 4.1 Civil Rights and Immigration  
America's civil rights landscape shows significant shifts, with reports noting that "5 Years After George Floyd's Murder, the Backlash Takes Hold" [1], suggesting a societal and political reaction against racial justice initiatives. Amid this climate, LGBTQ+ advocacy continues as "diverse pride groups converge on DC with differing interests but common goals" [2].

Immigration enforcement exhibits both aggressive tactics and policy contradictions. Reports indicate "masked ICE agents are showing up at courthouses," characterized as a "'flagrant' violation of due process" [3], while administration officials dismiss concerns about immigrants' rights as "burdensome" [4]. Simultaneously, the administration has released "people to shelters it threatened to prosecute for aiding migrants" [5], suggesting inconsistent policy implementation.

### 4.2 Environmental and State-Level Developments  
Environmental policy changes could have significant practical implications. Weather forecasters anticipate a "busy hurricane season" but "fear Trump cuts" to forecasting and preparedness resources [1], raising concerns about disaster readiness. Separately, "energy efficiency rollbacks could cost Americans $43 billion in higher utility bills" [2].

State politics show dynamic developments with potential national implications. New Jersey has become "suddenly center of America's political universe as governor's race catches fire" [3]. In Omaha, Nebraska, a "Republican mayor loses reelection after running anti-transgender ads," with "Democratic challenger John Ewing" defeating "Republican incumbent Jean Stothert 56 percent to 44 percent" [4]. In Texas, lawmakers are moving forward with legislation that would require religious displays in classrooms, as the state "is closer to putting the Ten Commandments in classrooms after a key vote" [5].

## 5. International Relations

### 5.1 Russia-Ukraine and Middle East  
The Trump administration's approach to the Russia-Ukraine conflict is generating significant scrutiny. Reports highlight "US silence as Russia steps up attacks on Ukraine" [1]. Former National Security Council official Fiona Hill has claimed that "Trump is terrified of Putin," stating she's "seen it first-hand" [2].

U.S. policy in the Middle East is undergoing significant shifts. The Trump administration has "lifted sweeping sanctions against Syria" [3], representing a major change in approach toward the Assad regime. Regarding Kurdish issues, former Secretary of State "Pompeo urges U.S. to support Kurdish autonomy," arguing that "the Kurds deserve better" [4]. Tensions with the EU are also emerging, with the bloc warning the U.S. "don't trade threats with us" [5].

## 6. Legislative Developments

### 6.1 Budget and Regulatory Legislation  
Republican budget legislation is generating concerns about fiscal stability and healthcare funding. Reports indicate a "GOP bill locks in new deficit plateau as bond market quakes" [1], suggesting financial market concerns about fiscal implications. The same budget bill "faces Senate opposition over Medicaid" [2], indicating potential intra-party disagreement about healthcare funding provisions.

Recent legislation contains far-reaching implications for technological regulation, as the House has passed a "budget bill that inexplicably bans state AI regulations for ten years," though it "still has to go through the Senate" [3]. Digital equity programs are also facing challenges, as "the Digital Equity Act tried to close the digital divide" but "Trump calls it racist and acts to end it" [4].

Political observers are offering varying assessments of the Trump administration's impact. The New York Times reports on "How Donald Trump Has Remade America's Political Landscape" [1], while scientists are being urged to "stand up against Trump's repressive agenda" [2]. Former Vice President Kamala Harris has publicly criticized Elon Musk and "acknowledged the rise of fascism," stating "I do worry, frankly, about what's happening in the world right now" [3].

The Democratic Party is experiencing internal reflection following electoral defeat. Former Representative Dean Phillips has "hammered party over health cover-up," criticizing what he characterized as "'constant lying and gaslighting' about Biden's deteriorating health" [4]. Activist David Hogg has identified Representative "Jasmine Crockett as leader Democrats need" [5], while geographic strategy discussions suggest "the Democrats' path back to power might start in places like this Appalachian town" [6].

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Judiciary and Legal Affairs

### 1.1 Court Rulings and Legal Challenges
Federal courts continue challenging Trump administration policies with limited efficacy. Multiple judges have ruled against Trump's actions but face implementation barriers [1]. One federal judge has explicitly halted what is described as Trump's "radical transformation of government" [2]. In education policy, a judge blocked the administration's attempt to revoke international students' status at Harvard [3]. These rulings indicate significant judiciary-executive tensions, with courts struggling to exercise effective oversight.

Financial markets are expressing concern about U.S. economic stability. An Allianz GI manager warns that the country risks losing its "reliable investment" status [1], indicating potential long-term consequences for U.S. financial credibility.

President Trump has temporarily delayed implementing 50% tariffs on the European Union until July 9 [2], creating a brief window for negotiations. German finance officials are pushing for "serious" EU-US talks to address the tariff threat [3]. Simultaneously, U.S. senators are appealing to Canada, urging them to "give us another chance" on trade and tourism [4], suggesting efforts to repair strained North American relationships.

## 3. Executive Branch Policies

### 3.1 Administration Ethics
The Trump family is aggressively monetizing the presidency, with financial gains reportedly outpacing public objections [1]. The Trump presidential library project has secured $37 million and a jet, with Eric Trump directing the initiative [2]. President Trump's cryptocurrency ventures have triggered ethics alarms, with critics describing them as a "roadmap for corruption" [3]. House Speaker Mike Johnson has dismissed concerns about Trump's cryptocurrency activities, saying he's too "busy" to address the matter [4].

### 3.3 Presidential Rhetoric
President Trump's rhetoric continues reshaping America's political landscape with wide-ranging effects [1].

## 4. Congress and Federal Legislation

### 4.1 Budget and Taxation
Significant Republican divisions have emerged over fiscal policies. Senator Ron Johnson has publicly criticized GOP spending legislation, claiming there are "enough" Republican votes to "stop the process" [1] and arguing that "you don't defeat the deep state by funding it" [2]. Additional Republican lawmakers have threatened to block Trump's spending bill if national debt reduction isn't prioritized [3]. Democrats have attacked Trump's tax bill as "Robin Hood in reverse," alleging it increases home-buying costs [4].

### 4.2 Healthcare Policy
Medicaid cuts are threatening rural hospital survival [1], jeopardizing healthcare access in less populated regions. House Speaker Mike Johnson has defended removing people from Medicaid as "moral" [2] and claimed there are "more than 1.4 million illegal aliens on Medicaid" [3], linking healthcare policy to immigration debates. A separate report alleges U.S. officials delayed warning the public about heart inflammation risks from COVID shots [4].

### 4.3 Party Politics
Six months after the 2024 election, Democrats are struggling to establish a coherent strategy [1], with reports suggesting deepening internal divisions potentially leading to a "Democratic Civil War" [2]. Progressive resistance to the Trump administration is organizing through grassroots movements like Indivisible [3]. Strategic debates include how Democrats should position themselves culturally, with some arguing they need to appeal to Joe Rogan's audience rather than creating a "left-wing" alternative [4].

## 5. State and Education Policy

### 5.1 Education Governance
State-level higher education governance is undergoing significant changes affecting academic freedom. In Texas, legislation approved by the House would give political appointees greater control over university courses and hiring decisions [1]. At the federal level, a former Democrat is leading President Trump's initiatives targeting ten universities [2], though specific actions remain unspecified. Texas is advancing legislation requiring public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments, despite constitutional concerns from a similar Louisiana law being deemed unconstitutional [3].

## 6. Civil Rights and Social Issues

### 6.1 Race and Law Enforcement
Analysis suggests President Trump is reframing civil rights protections to primarily benefit white men [1]. Five years after George Floyd's death, police reform efforts show mixed results, with an analysis indicating police killings have actually increased, particularly affecting Black victims [2]. The Department of Justice has dropped oversight of multiple police departments [3], while qualified immunity continues shielding officers from civil rights claims [4]. Additionally, the LAPD faces ongoing financial consequences for tactics used during George Floyd protests [5].

### 6.2 Immigration and Gender Issues
The Trump administration's immigration enforcement has intensified across jurisdictions. The U.S. attorney in Los Angeles is working to "neutralize" California's sanctuary rules [1], indicating federal efforts to override state-level immigrant protections. The southern border is described as "quiet," with a border agent's "slow day" attributed to the "Trump effect" [2]. On transgender healthcare, Utah Republicans face criticism for ignoring research results they themselves requested regarding gender-affirming care for transgender youth [3].

## 7. Science, Technology and Culture

### 7.1 Research and Surveillance
U.S. scientists are experiencing job losses and grant cuts, creating recruitment opportunities for foreign universities seeking American talent [1]. This trend threatens to accelerate brain drain in critical research fields. Meanwhile, U.S. intelligence agencies are developing a centralized platform to streamline the purchase of private citizens' personal data [2], creating significant privacy implications.

### 7.2 Cultural Expressions
Cultural institutions are responding to shifting federal priorities. Small museums preserving local history are described as "casualties in Trump's war on the arts" [1], suggesting reduced support for cultural preservation. Bruce Springsteen's protest has sparked debate about its appropriateness as a Memorial Day statement [2], highlighting the politically charged nature of artistic expression.

====================

**Step 2**

Merging:

Please faithfully merge all summary chunks into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks. 

Length Requirement: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

You must make sure all the news facts are accurate, news titles are accurate, and the URLs are precise. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical, because they were individually determined by LLMs. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You can reference to the merged hierarchical categories in the last round, and you can refine the categories if you like.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.  Although the citations have already been carefully selected, some articles are still better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. In that case, please think carefully and pick up the most important contents within the constraint of the total word count and number of citations. **In each topic, the citations count from [1].**

Please first think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. Then, think intelligently, and write the entire summary.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Use readable and accessible language. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Length Requirement Repeated for Emphasis: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

Please directly produce daily_briefing.txt containing your new summary, without asking for my permission.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Trump Administration Policies and Actions

### 1.1 Executive Reshaping and Personnel Changes  
The White House has dismissed "scores of National Security Council staff" [1], dramatically reducing this critical advisory body. Simultaneously, career foreign service veterans are reportedly being replaced with loyalists at the State Department in what critics characterize as the formation of a "Maga deep state" [2]. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has implemented increased restrictions on press access at the Pentagon amid information leak concerns [3].

### 1.2 Presidential Business Interests and Ethics  
Multiple reports indicate the Trump family is leveraging presidential power for business gain. Vietnamese authorities "ignored their own laws to fast-track a Trump Family Golf Complex" [1], while broader reporting indicates the family is actively "monetizing the presidency" with profits that "outstrip protests" [2]. Specific controversies include a "corrupt meme coin dinner" prompting lawmakers to demand transparency about attendees [3], and a reported $300 million purchase of "Trump memecoin" by "a Chinese company with no revenue" [4]. The Trump presidential library project has secured $37 million and a jet, with Eric Trump directing the initiative [5].

### 1.3 Presidential Communication and Directives  
During a commencement address at West Point, President Trump delivered what was characterized as a "rally-style speech" criticizing DEI policies [1]. The speech included comments suggesting confusion about stealth technology in military aircraft, with the President apparently maintaining that stealth jets are "literally invisible" [2]. President Trump has demanded that Harvard University provide "names and countries" of all its international students [3], while national parks have been ordered to "police 'negative' history" under a Trump directive [4].

## 2. Judiciary and Legal Affairs

### 2.1 Executive-Judicial Conflict and Court Rulings  
Tensions between the judicial branch and Trump administration are escalating significantly, characterized as an "all-out war" between Trump and the courts [1]. Multiple judges have ruled against Trump's actions but face implementation barriers [2]. One federal judge has explicitly halted what is described as Trump's "radical transformation of government" [3]. Legislative action appears to support this conflict, as "Republicans snuck a provision into their megabill that would let Trump defy the courts" [4]. Specific court rulings against the administration include a judge ordering "the Trump administration to return wrongly deported gay man" [5] and blocking the administration's attempt to revoke international students' status at Harvard [6].

### 2.2 Judicial Security and Constitutional Questions  
Federal judges are considering unprecedented measures to secure their own protection amid growing threats. Reports indicate "judges weigh taking control of their own security amid threats" [1] because U.S. Marshals "ultimately answer to President Trump, who has ramped up criticism of the judiciary" [2]. Legal experts are raising alarms about democratic erosion and expanding presidential power. Analysts question how citizens might recognize warning signs of democratic decline [3], while others scrutinize recent Supreme Court decisions that appear to grant the executive branch expanded authority [4].

## 3. Economic and Trade Policy

### 3.1 Tariffs and International Trade Relations  
President Trump's tariff policies are generating significant economic uncertainty. Recent "new tariff threats" indicate trade uncertainty will persist [1], while analysis shows the administration is "pivoting from tax cuts to tariffs" while reportedly "ignoring economic warning signs" [2]. Critics argue these "big, beautiful tariffs" will "make us all poorer" [3]. President Trump has temporarily delayed implementing 50% tariffs on the European Union until July 9 [4], creating a brief window for negotiations. German finance officials are pushing for "serious" EU-US talks to address the tariff threat [5].

### 3.2 Economic Stability and Budget Priorities  
Financial markets are expressing concern about U.S. economic stability. An Allianz GI manager warns that the country risks losing its "reliable investment" status [1]. Scientific research faces substantial cuts, as "scientists have lost their jobs or grants in US cuts" with some being recruited by "foreign universities" [2]. In contrast, Trump reportedly "brags that he's 'not cutting 10 cents' from Pentagon" even as the "GOP guts Medicaid" [3], indicating a clear shift in federal funding priorities.

## 4. Legislative Developments

### 4.1 Budget Legislation and Republican Divisions  
Significant Republican divisions have emerged over fiscal policies. Senator Ron Johnson has publicly criticized GOP spending legislation, claiming there are "enough" Republican votes to "stop the process" [1] and arguing that "you don't defeat the deep state by funding it" [2]. Additional Republican lawmakers have threatened to block Trump's spending bill if national debt reduction isn't prioritized [3]. Recent legislation contains far-reaching implications for technological regulation, as the House has passed a "budget bill that inexplicably bans state AI regulations for ten years" [4].

### 4.2 Healthcare and Social Programs  
Medicaid cuts are threatening rural hospital survival, jeopardizing healthcare access in less populated regions [1]. House Speaker Mike Johnson has defended removing people from Medicaid as "moral" [2] and claimed there are "more than 1.4 million illegal aliens on Medicaid" [3], linking healthcare policy to immigration debates. The same budget bill "faces Senate opposition over Medicaid" [4], indicating potential intra-party disagreement about healthcare funding provisions. Digital equity programs are also facing challenges, as "the Digital Equity Act tried to close the digital divide" but "Trump calls it racist and acts to end it" [5].

## 5. Civil Rights and Social Policy

### 5.1 Immigration Enforcement  
The Trump administration's immigration enforcement has intensified across jurisdictions. The U.S. attorney in Los Angeles is working to "neutralize" California's sanctuary rules [1], indicating federal efforts to override state-level immigrant protections. The southern border is described as "quiet," with a border agent's "slow day" attributed to the "Trump effect" [2]. Reports indicate "masked ICE agents are showing up at courthouses," characterized as a "'flagrant' violation of due process" [3], while administration officials dismiss concerns about immigrants' rights as "burdensome" [4].

### 5.2 Race, Law Enforcement, and Civil Rights  
Analysis suggests President Trump is reframing civil rights protections to primarily benefit white men [1]. Five years after George Floyd's death, police reform efforts show mixed results, with reports indicating police killings have actually increased, particularly affecting Black victims [2]. The Department of Justice has dropped oversight of multiple police departments [3], while qualified immunity continues shielding officers from civil rights claims [4]. America's civil rights landscape shows significant shifts, with reports noting that "5 Years After George Floyd's Murder, the Backlash Takes Hold" [5].

### 5.3 Education and State-Level Developments  
State-level higher education governance is undergoing significant changes affecting academic freedom. In Texas, legislation approved by the House would give political appointees greater control over university courses and hiring decisions [1]. Texas is also advancing legislation requiring public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments [2]. State politics show dynamic developments with potential national implications. New Jersey has become "suddenly center of America's political universe as governor's race catches fire" [3]. In Omaha, Nebraska, a "Republican mayor loses reelection after running anti-transgender ads," with "Democratic challenger John Ewing" defeating "Republican incumbent Jean Stothert 56 percent to 44 percent" [4].

## 6. International Relations

### 6.1 Russia-Ukraine Conflict  
The Trump administration's approach to the Russia-Ukraine conflict is generating significant scrutiny. Reports highlight "US silence as Russia steps up attacks on Ukraine" [1]. Former National Security Council official Fiona Hill has claimed that "Trump is terrified of Putin," stating she's "seen it first-hand" [2]. President Zelensky claims that "U.S. silence" over Russian attacks is emboldening Putin [3], though President Trump has expressed dissatisfaction with Putin's bombing of Ukraine [4].

### 6.2 Middle East and Foreign Policy Shifts  
U.S. policy in the Middle East is undergoing significant shifts. The Trump administration has "lifted sweeping sanctions against Syria" [1], representing a major change in approach toward the Assad regime. Regarding Kurdish issues, former Secretary of State "Pompeo urges U.S. to support Kurdish autonomy," arguing that "the Kurds deserve better" [2]. Tensions with the EU are also emerging, with the bloc warning the U.S. "don't trade threats with us" [3].

## 7. Political Landscape

### 7.1 Party Politics and Democratic Strategy  
Six months after the 2024 election, Democrats are struggling to establish a coherent strategy [1], with reports suggesting deepening internal divisions potentially leading to a "Democratic Civil War" [2]. Progressive resistance to the Trump administration is organizing through grassroots movements like Indivisible [3]. Former Representative Dean Phillips has "hammered party over health cover-up," criticizing what he characterized as "'constant lying and gaslighting' about Biden's deteriorating health" [4]. Democratic Representative Jasmine Crockett has called for Republicans to "question Trump's mental acuity" [5].

### 7.2 Scientific Research and Cultural Impacts  
U.S. scientists are experiencing job losses and grant cuts, creating recruitment opportunities for foreign universities seeking American talent [1]. Weather forecasters anticipate a "busy hurricane season" but "fear Trump cuts" to forecasting and preparedness resources [2]. Cultural institutions are responding to shifting federal priorities. Small museums preserving local history are described as "casualties in Trump's war on the arts" [3], suggesting reduced support for cultural preservation.

**Step 3**

Length Control:

Now, it is the time to take a look at your document length again. Before you do anything else, count the words (without counting the URLs) and number of citations, and explicitly write those out. 

See if they fit to the desired range: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

If not, please refine your summary, according to my requirements in Step 2. Especially, you should not make the language technical or dry, after you shortened the text. The language should always be readable and accessible. If you find other mistakes, please directly correct them. 

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You should produce the new daily_briefing.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Trump Administration Policies and Actions

### 1.1 Executive Reshaping and Personnel Changes  
The White House has dismissed "scores of National Security Council staff" [1], dramatically reducing this critical advisory body. Simultaneously, career foreign service veterans are reportedly being replaced with loyalists at the State Department in what critics characterize as the formation of a "Maga deep state" [2]. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has implemented increased restrictions on press access at the Pentagon amid information leak concerns [3].

### 1.2 Presidential Business Interests and Ethics  
Multiple reports indicate the Trump family is leveraging presidential power for business gain. Vietnamese authorities "ignored their own laws to fast-track a Trump Family Golf Complex" [1], while broader reporting indicates the family is actively "monetizing the presidency" with profits that "outstrip protests" [2]. Specific controversies include a "corrupt meme coin dinner" [3] and a reported $300 million purchase of "Trump memecoin" by "a Chinese company with no revenue" [4].

### 1.3 Presidential Communication and Directives  
During a commencement address at West Point, President Trump delivered what was characterized as a "rally-style speech" criticizing DEI policies [1]. The speech included comments suggesting confusion about stealth technology, with the President apparently maintaining that stealth jets are "literally invisible" [2]. President Trump has demanded that Harvard University provide "names and countries" of all its international students [3], while national parks have been ordered to "police 'negative' history" under a Trump directive [4].

## 2. Judiciary and Legal Affairs

### 2.1 Executive-Judicial Conflict and Court Rulings  
Tensions between the judicial branch and Trump administration are escalating significantly, characterized as an "all-out war" between Trump and the courts [1]. Multiple judges have ruled against Trump's actions but face implementation barriers [2]. One federal judge has explicitly halted what is described as Trump's "radical transformation of government" [3]. Legislative action appears to support this conflict, as "Republicans snuck a provision into their megabill that would let Trump defy the courts" [4].

### 2.2 Judicial Security and Constitutional Questions  
Federal judges are considering unprecedented measures to secure their own protection amid growing threats. Reports indicate "judges weigh taking control of their own security amid threats" [1] because U.S. Marshals "ultimately answer to President Trump, who has ramped up criticism of the judiciary" [2]. Legal experts are raising alarms about democratic erosion and expanding presidential power, questioning how citizens might recognize warning signs of democratic decline [3].

## 3. Economic and Trade Policy

### 3.1 Tariffs and International Trade Relations  
President Trump's tariff policies are generating significant economic uncertainty. Recent "new tariff threats" indicate trade uncertainty will persist [1], while analysis shows the administration is "pivoting from tax cuts to tariffs" while reportedly "ignoring economic warning signs" [2]. President Trump has temporarily delayed implementing 50% tariffs on the European Union until July 9 [3], creating a brief window for negotiations. German finance officials are pushing for "serious" EU-US talks to address the tariff threat [4].

### 3.2 Economic Stability and Budget Priorities  
Financial markets are expressing concern about U.S. economic stability. An Allianz GI manager warns that the country risks losing its "reliable investment" status [1]. Scientific research faces substantial cuts, as "scientists have lost their jobs or grants in US cuts" with some being recruited by "foreign universities" [2]. In contrast, Trump reportedly "brags that he's 'not cutting 10 cents' from Pentagon" even as the "GOP guts Medicaid" [3].

## 4. Legislative Developments

### 4.1 Budget Legislation and Republican Divisions  
Significant Republican divisions have emerged over fiscal policies. Senator Ron Johnson has publicly criticized GOP spending legislation, claiming there are "enough" Republican votes to "stop the process" [1] and arguing that "you don't defeat the deep state by funding it" [2]. Additional Republican lawmakers have threatened to block Trump's spending bill if national debt reduction isn't prioritized [3]. Recent legislation contains far-reaching implications for technological regulation, as the House has passed a "budget bill that inexplicably bans state AI regulations for ten years" [4].

### 4.2 Healthcare and Social Programs  
Medicaid cuts are threatening rural hospital survival [1]. House Speaker Mike Johnson has defended removing people from Medicaid as "moral" [2] and claimed there are "more than 1.4 million illegal aliens on Medicaid" [3], linking healthcare policy to immigration debates. The same budget bill "faces Senate opposition over Medicaid" [4], indicating potential intra-party disagreement about healthcare funding provisions.

## 5. Civil Rights and Social Policy

### 5.1 Immigration Enforcement  
The Trump administration's immigration enforcement has intensified across jurisdictions. The U.S. attorney in Los Angeles is working to "neutralize" California's sanctuary rules [1], indicating federal efforts to override state-level immigrant protections. Reports indicate "masked ICE agents are showing up at courthouses," characterized as a "'flagrant' violation of due process" [2], while administration officials dismiss concerns about immigrants' rights as "burdensome" [3].

### 5.2 Race, Law Enforcement, and Civil Rights  
America's civil rights landscape shows significant shifts, with reports noting that "5 Years After George Floyd's Murder, the Backlash Takes Hold" [1]. Five years after Floyd's death, police reform efforts show mixed results, with reports indicating police killings have increased, particularly affecting Black victims [2]. The Department of Justice has dropped oversight of multiple police departments [3], while qualified immunity continues shielding officers from civil rights claims [4].

### 5.3 Education and State-Level Developments  
In Texas, legislation approved by the House would give political appointees greater control over university courses and hiring decisions [1]. Texas is also advancing legislation requiring public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments [2]. In Omaha, Nebraska, a "Republican mayor loses reelection after running anti-transgender ads," with "Democratic challenger John Ewing" defeating "Republican incumbent Jean Stothert 56 percent to 44 percent" [3].

## 6. International Relations

### 6.1 Russia-Ukraine Conflict  
The Trump administration's approach to the Russia-Ukraine conflict is generating significant scrutiny. Reports highlight "US silence as Russia steps up attacks on Ukraine" [1]. Former National Security Council official Fiona Hill has claimed that "Trump is terrified of Putin," stating she's "seen it first-hand" [2]. President Zelensky claims that "U.S. silence" over Russian attacks is emboldening Putin [3], though President Trump has expressed dissatisfaction with Putin's bombing of Ukraine [4].

### 6.2 Middle East and Foreign Policy Shifts  
U.S. policy in the Middle East is undergoing significant shifts. The Trump administration has "lifted sweeping sanctions against Syria" [1], representing a major change in approach toward the Assad regime. Regarding Kurdish issues, former Secretary of State "Pompeo urges U.S. to support Kurdish autonomy," arguing that "the Kurds deserve better" [2].

## 7. Political Landscape

### 7.1 Party Politics and Democratic Strategy  
Six months after the 2024 election, Democrats are struggling to establish a coherent strategy [1], with reports suggesting deepening internal divisions potentially leading to a "Democratic Civil War" [2]. Former Representative Dean Phillips has "hammered party over health cover-up," criticizing what he characterized as "'constant lying and gaslighting' about Biden's deteriorating health" [3]. Democratic Representative Jasmine Crockett has called for Republicans to "question Trump's mental acuity" [4].

### 7.2 Scientific Research and Cultural Impacts  
Weather forecasters anticipate a "busy hurricane season" but "fear Trump cuts" to forecasting and preparedness resources [1]. Cultural institutions are responding to shifting federal priorities, with small museums preserving local history described as "casualties in Trump's war on the arts" [2].

**Step 4**

Finalizing:

Now, it is the time to finalize your summary.

It is still quite likely that you made some factual mistakes. Please do a very careful, independent review of your summary. **Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

After you check the facts, you should also carefully check the tone, format, style and length. Use readable and accessible language. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

If you find mistakes, please directly correct them. It is time to produce the final daily_briefing.md, in simple Markdown format, without asking for my permission. 

Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing.

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

--- 


Right before you start printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `daily_briefing.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made. Thank you very much for all your hard work!

### 1.3 Presidential Communication and Directives

## 2. Judiciary and Legal Affairs

### 2.1 Executive-Judicial Conflict and Court Rulings  
Tensions between the judicial branch and Trump administration are escalating significantly, characterized as an "all-out war" between Trump and the courts [1]. Multiple judges have ruled against Trump's actions but face implementation barriers [2]. One federal judge has explicitly halted what is described as Trump's "radical transformation of government" [3]. Legislative action appears to support this conflict, as "Republicans snuck a provision into their megabill that would let Trump defy the courts" [4].

### 2.2 Judicial Security and Constitutional Questions  
Federal judges are considering unprecedented measures to secure their own protection amid growing threats. Reports indicate "judges weigh taking control of their own security amid threats" [1] because U.S. Marshals "ultimately answer to President Trump, who has ramped up criticism of the judiciary" [2]. Legal experts are raising alarms about democratic erosion and expanding presidential power, questioning how citizens might recognize warning signs of democratic decline [3].

## 3. Economic and Trade Policy

### 3.1 Tariffs and International Trade Relations  
President Trump's tariff policies are generating significant economic uncertainty. Recent "new tariff threats" indicate trade uncertainty will persist [1], while analysis shows the administration is "pivoting from tax cuts to tariffs" while reportedly "ignoring economic warning signs" [2]. President Trump has temporarily delayed implementing 50% tariffs on the European Union until July 9 [3], creating a brief window for negotiations. German finance officials are pushing for "serious" EU-US talks to address the tariff threat [4].

### 3.2 Economic Stability and Budget Priorities  
Financial markets are expressing concern about U.S. economic stability. An Allianz GI manager warns that the country risks losing its "reliable investment" status [1]. Scientific research faces substantial cuts, as "scientists have lost their jobs or grants in US cuts" with some being recruited by "foreign universities" [2]. In contrast, Trump reportedly "brags that he's 'not cutting 10 cents' from Pentagon" even as the "GOP guts Medicaid" [3].

## 4. Legislative Developments

### 4.1 Budget Legislation and Republican Divisions  
Significant Republican divisions have emerged over fiscal policies. Senator Ron Johnson has publicly criticized GOP spending legislation, claiming there are "enough" Republican votes to "stop the process" [1] and arguing that "you don't defeat the deep state by funding it" [2]. Additional Republican lawmakers have threatened to block Trump's spending bill if national debt reduction isn't prioritized [3]. Recent legislation contains far-reaching implications for technological regulation, as the House has passed a "budget bill that inexplicably bans state AI regulations for ten years" [4].

### 4.2 Healthcare and Social Programs  
Medicaid cuts are threatening rural hospital survival [1]. House Speaker Mike Johnson has defended removing people from Medicaid as "moral" [2] and claimed there are "more than 1.4 million illegal aliens on Medicaid" [3], linking healthcare policy to immigration debates. The same budget bill "faces Senate opposition over Medicaid" [4], indicating potential intra-party disagreement about healthcare funding provisions.

## 5. Civil Rights and Social Policy

### 5.1 Immigration Enforcement  
The Trump administration's immigration enforcement has intensified across jurisdictions. The U.S. attorney in Los Angeles is working to "neutralize" California's sanctuary rules [1], indicating federal efforts to override state-level immigrant protections. Reports indicate "masked ICE agents are showing up at courthouses," characterized as a "'flagrant' violation of due process" [2], while administration officials dismiss concerns about immigrants' rights as "burdensome" [3].

### 5.2 Race, Law Enforcement, and Civil Rights  
America's civil rights landscape shows significant shifts, with reports noting that "5 Years After George Floyd's Murder, the Backlash Takes Hold" [1]. Five years after Floyd's death, police reform efforts show mixed results, with reports indicating police killings have increased, particularly affecting Black victims [2]. The Department of Justice has dropped oversight of multiple police departments [3], while qualified immunity continues shielding officers from civil rights claims [4].

### 5.3 Education and State-Level Developments  
In Texas, legislation approved by the House would give political appointees greater control over university courses and hiring decisions [1]. Texas is also advancing legislation requiring public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments [2]. In Omaha, Nebraska, a "Republican mayor loses reelection after running anti-transgender ads," with "Democratic challenger John Ewing" defeating "Republican incumbent Jean Stothert 56 percent to 44 percent" [3].

## 6. International Relations

### 6.1 Russia-Ukraine Conflict  
The Trump administration's approach to the Russia-Ukraine conflict is generating significant scrutiny. Reports highlight "US silence as Russia steps up attacks on Ukraine" [1]. Former National Security Council official Fiona Hill has claimed that "Trump is terrified of Putin," stating she's "seen it first-hand" [2]. President Zelensky claims that "U.S. silence" over Russian attacks is emboldening Putin [3], though President Trump has expressed dissatisfaction with Putin's bombing of Ukraine [4].

U.S. policy in the Middle East is undergoing significant shifts. The Trump administration has "lifted sweeping sanctions against Syria" [1], representing a major change in approach toward the Assad regime.

## 7. Political Landscape

### 7.1 Party Politics and Democratic Strategy  
Six months after the 2024 election, Democrats are struggling to establish a coherent strategy [1], with reports suggesting deepening internal divisions potentially leading to a "Democratic Civil War" [2]. Former Representative Dean Phillips has "hammered party over health cover-up," criticizing what he characterized as "'constant lying and gaslighting' about Biden's deteriorating health" [3]. Democratic Representative Jasmine Crockett has called for Republicans to "question Trump's mental acuity" [4].
