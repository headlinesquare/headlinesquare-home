**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL news posts from r/politics. I understand I'll be creating a comprehensive Daily Briefing for both Democratic and Republican congressional leadership about the current political situation in May 2025, during President Trump's administration.

I'll follow the 8-step workflow process as instructed, focusing strictly on the factual information provided in the headlines without making speculations based on outdated knowledge. I'll be particularly careful when referencing political figures' current positions, relying only on the information provided in your background materials.

Please provide the JSONL lines in your next prompt, and I'll begin with Step 1: defining the categories for the news.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

Revisions made:
1. Moved "Disaster Response" to Area 1 as it relates more directly to executive administration
2. Created a separate area for "Education & Civil Rights" to better capture the numerous Harvard/civil rights stories
3. Separated "Health & Environmental Policy" into its own area for clearer organization
4. Renamed and refined several topics to better reflect the specific news content
5. Increased from 6 to 7 major areas to provide more focused categorization while staying within the 5-8 limit
6. Reordered areas to keep related topics closer together (e.g., immigration and education/civil rights)


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

This completes Step 2. Every article from the original JSONL list (IDs 88–174) now appears exactly once, each uniquely assigned to one area and one topic as defined.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 5
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the finalized hierarchical file “step2_categorized.txt.” In it each article (by its original JSON line) has been uniquely grouped—first by its Area and then by its Topic. I have also rechecked that every article (IDs 88 through 174, a total of 87 articles) appears exactly once. In this revision I reorganized the flat list into a true hierarchy by area and topic, grouping together articles assigned to the same topic and preserving their original (ascending) order by ID.

Revisions made in this version compared with the flat Step 2 result:
1. I reorganized the articles into a true hierarchical structure by Area and Topic.
2. I carefully verified that every JSON record (from ID 88 through 174) appears exactly once under its assigned category.
3. Within each Topic, the articles are listed in their original order (ascending by ID).

====================
    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete “step3.txt” file. In it each article’s JSON line now includes an "importance" key (with the article’s score added immediately after the "title"), and each Topic and Area is annotated with an overall importance score (based on our evaluations of the individual reports and the weight of the reporting on that issue). (Scores are on a 1–10 scale, with 10 used sparingly.)

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised “step3.txt” file with updated scores. In this version I made the following revisions after a careful re‐evaluation:
• For several articles whose source or title clarity suggested a bit more (or somewhat less) impact, I slightly adjusted their individual scores to improve consistency. For example, I raised Reuters and CNN coverage scores by one point when they conveyed clear, impactful legal or international developments, and slightly reduced some opinion‐style or less specific pieces.
• I rechecked that each article’s “importance” value is inserted immediately after “title” and that every topic and area has a consolidated importance score consistent with the weight of its articles.
• I ensured that no article or topic score saturates the scale unnecessarily and that the overall ordering remains consistent.

**Step 4 (logic-heavy)**

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

**First Check After Step 4**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes and produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 10
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised final “step4.txt” file. In this version I have re‐checked every level of the hierarchy (areas, topics, and individual articles) to ensure that sorting is done in strict descending order by the “importance” score while preserving the original order for items that tie. I did notice one minor reordering in Area 2 (ensuring Topic 2.3 moved to the top as its importance is 8) and verified all JSON lines remain intact. No information was dropped.

Revisions Summary:
1. Moved Topic 2.3 ("Budget Legislation and Fiscal Policies") to the top within Area 2 because its importance (8) is higher than the other topics (7) in that area.
2. Re-verified that every area, topic, and article is ordered strictly by descending importance, with ties preserving their original order.
3. Confirmed that no information was dropped and that all JSON objects retained their original content.

This completes the First Check After Step 4 with the revised “step4.txt” file.

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions and Checks Summary:
1. I re-checked that every record is uniquely included and that no article was dropped.
2. I reassigned the area numbering sequentially (Area 1 to Area 7) in the order they appear.
3. Within each area, I renumbered the topics in ascending order based on their order in the document (e.g., in Area 1, the topics are now numbered 1.1 through 1.5, overriding the previous non-sequential labels).
4. All content, ordering (by importance and tie preservation), and JSON record data remain exactly as previously sorted.

This completes the new “step4.txt” file as requested.


====================
    Round 12
    User: 
====================

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# step5.txt

────────────────────────────────────────────
Area 1: Executive Authority & Administration (importance: 8)

Topic 1.1: Disaster Response and Emergency Management (importance: 8)
Despite previous criticism of FEMA as "slow," the Trump administration is facing accusations of significant delays in providing disaster assistance. State and local officials from communities struck by deadly tornadoes and floods are reportedly "begging" for federal disaster aid, with some waiting months for assistance [143]. This situation represents a notable gap between the administration's previous criticism of disaster response efficiency and its current performance in delivering emergency relief to affected areas.

{"id": 143, "domain": "eenews.net", "title": "Trump, who called FEMA 'slow,' is making people wait months for help | Officials from states and cities struck by deadly tornadoes and floods are begging the Trump administration for disaster aid", "importance": 8}

Topic 1.2: Presidential Powers and Supreme Court Rulings (importance: 7)
The Supreme Court has significantly expanded presidential authority by granting President Trump's request to fire independent agency members, though explicitly exempting the Federal Reserve and Chairman Jerome Powell from this ruling [96]. This judicial decision has faced strong criticism, with Justice Kagan issuing what reports characterize as a "fiery dissent" condemning the administration as "subservient" and lamenting the elevation of "President over our precedent" [122]. Simultaneously, the judiciary has imposed some restraints on executive power, with judges temporarily blocking the administration's attempts at mass layoffs across multiple federal agencies [102, 106]. The administration has also encountered another judicial setback regarding its policies toward Harvard University [145]. These developments highlight the ongoing tension between expanding presidential authority and judicial oversight within the constitutional system.

Topic 1.3: Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and Musk's Role (importance: 7)
Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is expanding the implementation of his Grok AI system throughout U.S. government operations, raising substantial conflict of interest concerns as a private business owner directs technology integration into federal systems [108, 92]. Despite public announcements suggesting Musk would reduce his governmental role, reports indicate DOGE will continue operating without significant changes [151, 136]. This situation presents unprecedented questions about the boundaries between private technology ownership and public administration functions, with potential implications for government operations, data security, and ethical oversight.

Topic 1.4: Federal Agency Management and Restructuring (importance: 6)
Internal documents reveal significant operational dysfunction at the Department of Veterans Affairs that is actively jeopardizing patient care [101]. Additionally, federal agencies are reportedly violating legal provisions regarding administrative leave usage, creating unnecessary costs for taxpayers [95]. Personnel appointments are generating further concerns, as evidenced by reports that the newly appointed head of Social Security, recruited from Wall Street, admitted to staff that he "had to Google the job when he was offered it" [138]. The administration has also not followed through on proposed rescheduling of marijuana to a less restrictive regulatory category [168]. These developments suggest systemic challenges in federal agency management across multiple departments.

President Trump's proposed "Golden Dome" project has faced multiple obstacles, with analysis suggesting it could potentially compromise national security [112] and reports indicating that Canadian cooperation would be required for its construction [121]. The administration's communications accuracy has come under scrutiny, with fact-checkers noting that images characterized by Trump as depicting "White farmers" were actually Reuters footage from Congo, not South Africa [137]. Economic statements have reportedly triggered market volatility, with financial media criticizing White House communications that caused disruptions [172]. Additional controversies surround the President's approach to Oval Office meetings, with reports describing them as "setups" [97] and details emerging about a dinner with cryptocurrency promoters [114]. During a press briefing, Trump claimed that President Biden has "Stage 9" cancer [157], a statement that appears to be medically inaccurate as cancer staging typically only extends to stage 4.

Area 2: Economic & Trade Policy (importance: 8)

Topic 2.1: Budget Legislation and Fiscal Policies (importance: 8)
President Trump's administration has implemented substantial reductions in scientific research funding, bringing it to its lowest level in decades according to analysis from the New York Times [152]. This represents a significant shift in federal budget priorities with potential long-term implications for research institutions, technological development, and America's scientific leadership position.

Topic 2.2: Tariffs and Trade Wars (importance: 7)
President Trump has announced plans to impose sweeping new tariffs, threatening 50% duties on European Union imports and 25% penalties specifically on Apple products not manufactured in the United States [100, 105, 109]. The President characterized trade talks with the EU as "going nowhere" to justify the tariff announcement [165]. These actions have reportedly caused significant market disruptions, described by some analysts as a "scorched earth trade war" [118]. The economic impacts extend beyond the EU and technology sectors, with reports that Canadian companies face potential tax increases [119] and Puerto Rico is actively seeking to attract manufacturing facilities displaced by the expanding trade tensions [170]. The timing of the EU tariff announcement has drawn particular attention, coming just two days after the European Union signed a minerals deal with Greenland [156]. Multiple major retailers have responded differently to these developments, with reports that "Walmart got an angry message from Trump on tariffs" while "Home Depot and Target downplayed them" [141].

Meanwhile, Puerto Rico is attempting to position itself as a manufacturing destination that could benefit from the administration's tariff policies [170]. In a development affecting rural economic development, states have reportedly been forced to cancel millions of dollars in rural broadband investments following the administration's termination of the Digital Equity Act, with reports claiming the decision was made specifically because the legislation contained the word "equity" [133].

Topic 3.2: Foreign Student Policies and Higher Education (importance: 7)
Harvard University has sued the Trump administration over its decision to block foreign student enrollment [88], resulting in a series of judicial interventions. Multiple sources confirm that a federal judge has temporarily blocked the administration's efforts to prevent international students from enrolling at Harvard [147, 149, 153, 154, 162, 166, 167]. This represents a significant legal challenge to the administration's immigration policies affecting higher education institutions. In response to the uncertainty for international students, international competitors are seeking advantage, with reports that Chinese educational institutions, including Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, have offered "unconditional offers" to Harvard's international students [91, 125].

Topic 3.3: Deportation and Detention Policies (importance: 6)
The Trump administration is seeking to end basic rights and protections for immigrant children in government custody, according to reports [155]. This policy shift comes amid concerns about personnel overseeing deportation operations, with the Wall Street Journal reporting on a "gang-linked prison chief taking custody of Trump's deportees" [169]. Additional controversies involve statements from immigration officials, including reports that the ICE director objected to journalists questioning "masked officers disappearing people" [93] and allegations that the DHS Secretary mischaracterized habeas corpus as "the power to deport people with no due process" [94]. These developments suggest significant changes to legal protections within the immigration enforcement system.

Topic 4.1: Civil Rights Enforcement (importance: 7)
The Trump administration has concluded an investigation into Columbia University, finding that the institution violated civil rights law by creating a "hostile environment" specifically for Jewish students [107, 140]. This determination represents a significant federal civil rights enforcement action within higher education. In a broader context, the administration faces criticism from opponents who claim it is pursuing policies that would "destroy fundamental rights that have existed for 800 years" [116], though the specific rights referenced require further clarification.

The Texas House of Representatives has approved legislation that would allow daily prayer time in public schools [135], representing a state-level development related to religious expression in educational settings. Separately, reports indicate increasing influence of Christian nationalist perspectives in Washington, with a pastor described as "outspoken" in these views expanding "his sway in Trump's DC" [90]. With limited information available on these developments, the full scope and implications for religious freedom and church-state separation policies remain unclear.

Republicans are facing accusations of flouting established law and precedent in efforts to revoke California's state authority over clean air regulations [110]. At the federal level, Congress is advancing legislation that would loosen toxic air pollution rules [174]. State-level environmental controversies are also emerging, with environmental groups filing legal challenges against Louisiana's ban on community air monitoring, even as a state task force recommends increased monitoring in areas affected by industrial pollution [104]. These developments suggest a multi-level shift in environmental regulatory approaches affecting both state authority and pollution control standards.

The White House has reportedly stated that President Trump wants to support primary challenges against Republicans who voted against his supported legislation [113]. In a significant development for budget negotiations, Senator Lindsey Graham has expressed opposition to a Trump-backed budget bill [173]. Democratic Party dynamics continue to evolve, with internal debates about electoral strategy [103, 139] and leadership processes, including a vote on whether to redo the election of David Hogg as DNC vice chair [159].

Area 1: Executive Authority & Administration (importance: 8)

Topic 1.1: Disaster Response and Emergency Management (importance: 8)
Despite previous criticism of FEMA as "slow," the Trump administration is facing accusations of significant delays in providing disaster assistance. State and local officials from communities struck by deadly tornadoes and floods are reportedly "begging" for federal disaster aid, with some waiting months for assistance [143]. This situation represents a notable gap between the administration's previous criticism of disaster response efficiency and its current performance in delivering emergency relief to affected areas.

Topic 1.2: Presidential Powers and Supreme Court Rulings (importance: 7)
The Supreme Court has significantly expanded presidential authority by granting President Trump's request to fire independent agency members, though explicitly exempting the Federal Reserve and Chairman Jerome Powell from this ruling [96]. This judicial decision has faced strong criticism, with Justice Kagan issuing what reports characterize as a "fiery dissent" condemning the administration as "subservient" and lamenting the elevation of "President over our precedent" [122]. Simultaneously, the judiciary has imposed some restraints on executive power, with judges temporarily blocking the administration's attempts at mass layoffs across multiple federal agencies [102, 106]. The administration has also encountered another judicial setback regarding its policies toward Harvard University [145]. These developments highlight the ongoing tension between expanding presidential authority and judicial oversight within the constitutional system.

Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is expanding the implementation of his Grok AI system throughout U.S. government operations, raising substantial conflict of interest concerns as a private business owner directs technology integration into federal systems [108, 92]. Despite public announcements suggesting Musk would reduce his governmental role, reports indicate DOGE will continue operating without significant changes [151, 136]. This situation presents unprecedented questions about the boundaries between private technology ownership and public administration functions, with potential implications for government operations, data security, and ethical oversight.

Internal documents reveal significant operational dysfunction at the Department of Veterans Affairs that is actively jeopardizing patient care [101]. Additionally, federal agencies are reportedly violating legal provisions regarding administrative leave usage, creating unnecessary costs for taxpayers [95]. Personnel appointments are generating further concerns, as evidenced by reports that the newly appointed head of Social Security, recruited from Wall Street, admitted to staff that he "had to Google the job when he was offered it" [138]. The administration has also not followed through on proposed rescheduling of marijuana to a less restrictive regulatory category [168].

The administration's communications accuracy has come under scrutiny, with fact-checkers noting that images characterized by Trump as depicting "White farmers" were actually Reuters footage from Congo, not South Africa [137]. Economic statements have reportedly triggered market volatility, with financial media criticizing White House communications that caused disruptions [172]. Additional controversies surround the President's approach to Oval Office meetings, with reports describing them as "setups" [97] and details emerging about a dinner with cryptocurrency promoters [114].

President Trump has announced plans to impose sweeping new tariffs, threatening 50% duties on European Union imports and 25% penalties specifically on Apple products not manufactured in the United States [100, 105, 109]. The President characterized trade talks with the EU as "going nowhere" to justify the tariff announcement [165]. These actions have reportedly caused significant market disruptions, described by some analysts as a "scorched earth trade war" [118]. The economic impacts extend beyond the EU and technology sectors, with reports that Canadian companies face potential tax increases [119] and Puerto Rico is actively seeking to attract manufacturing facilities displaced by the expanding trade tensions [170]. The timing of the EU tariff announcement has drawn particular attention, coming just two days after the European Union signed a minerals deal with Greenland [156]. Multiple major retailers have responded differently to these developments, with reports that "Walmart got an angry message from Trump on tariffs" while "Home Depot and Target downplayed them" [141].

In a development affecting rural economic development, states have reportedly been forced to cancel millions of dollars in rural broadband investments following the administration's termination of the Digital Equity Act, with reports claiming the decision was made specifically because the legislation contained the word "equity" [133].

Multiple sources confirm that a federal judge has temporarily blocked the administration's efforts to prevent international students from enrolling at Harvard [147, 149, 153, 154, 162, 166, 167]. This represents a significant legal challenge to the administration's immigration policies affecting higher education institutions. In response to the uncertainty for international students, international competitors are seeking advantage, with reports that Chinese educational institutions, including Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, have offered "unconditional offers" to Harvard's international students [91, 125].

This policy shift comes amid concerns about personnel overseeing deportation operations, with the Wall Street Journal reporting on a "gang-linked prison chief taking custody of Trump's deportees" [169]. Additional controversies involve statements from immigration officials, including reports that the ICE director objected to journalists questioning "masked officers disappearing people" [93] and allegations that the DHS Secretary mischaracterized habeas corpus as "the power to deport people with no due process" [94]. These developments suggest significant changes to legal protections within the immigration enforcement system.

In a significant development for budget negotiations, Senator Lindsey Graham has expressed opposition to a Trump-backed budget bill [173]. Democratic Party dynamics continue to evolve, with internal debates about electoral strategy [103, 139] and leadership processes, including a vote on whether to redo the election of David Hogg as DNC vice chair [159].

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# Daily Briefing: May 2025

## 1. Executive Authority & Administration

### 1.1 Presidential Powers and Court Rulings
The Supreme Court has significantly expanded presidential authority by granting President Trump's request to fire independent agency members, while explicitly exempting the Federal Reserve and Chairman Jerome Powell [1]. This ruling faced strong criticism, with Justice Kagan issuing what reports characterize as a "fiery dissent" condemning the elevation of "President over our precedent" [2]. Despite this expansion of executive power, the judiciary has imposed some restraints, with judges temporarily blocking the administration's attempts at mass layoffs across multiple federal agencies [3, 4].

### 1.2 Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)
Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is expanding the implementation of his Grok AI system throughout U.S. government operations, raising substantial conflict of interest concerns as a private business owner directs technology integration into federal systems [5, 6]. Despite public announcements suggesting Musk would reduce his governmental role, reports indicate DOGE will continue operating without significant changes [7].

### 1.3 Federal Agency Management
Internal documents reveal significant operational dysfunction at the Department of Veterans Affairs that is actively jeopardizing patient care [8]. Federal agencies are reportedly violating legal provisions regarding administrative leave usage, creating unnecessary costs for taxpayers [9]. Personnel appointments have generated concerns, as evidenced by reports that the newly appointed head of Social Security, recruited from Wall Street, admitted to staff that he "had to Google the job when he was offered it" [10].

### 1.4 Disaster Response
Despite previous criticism of FEMA as "slow," the Trump administration faces accusations of significant delays in providing disaster assistance. State and local officials from communities struck by deadly tornadoes and floods are reportedly "begging" for federal disaster aid, with some waiting months for assistance [11].

## 2. Economic & Trade Policy

### 2.1 Tariffs and International Trade
President Trump has announced plans to impose sweeping new tariffs, threatening 50% duties on European Union imports and 25% penalties specifically on Apple products not manufactured in the United States [1, 2, 3]. The President characterized trade talks with the EU as "going nowhere" to justify the tariff announcement [4]. These actions have reportedly caused significant market disruptions, described by some analysts as a "scorched earth trade war" [5]. Puerto Rico is actively seeking to attract manufacturing facilities displaced by the expanding trade tensions [6]. The timing of the EU tariff announcement has drawn particular attention, coming just two days after the European Union signed a minerals deal with Greenland [7].

### 2.2 Domestic Economic Impact
President Trump's administration has implemented substantial reductions in scientific research funding, bringing it to its lowest level in decades according to analysis from the New York Times [8]. Trump Media is expanding its financial market presence by pursuing an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) strategy targeting brokerage accounts [9]. In a development affecting rural economic development, states have reportedly been forced to cancel millions of dollars in rural broadband investments following the administration's termination of the Digital Equity Act, with reports claiming the decision was made specifically because the legislation contained the word "equity" [10].

## 3. Immigration & Border Control

In response to the uncertainty, Chinese educational institutions, including Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, have offered "unconditional offers" to Harvard's international students [4].

### 3.2 Border Enforcement and Detention
The Pentagon is deploying additional U.S. troops to the southern border [5], indicating an intensification of military involvement in border security operations. The Trump administration is seeking to end basic rights and protections for immigrant children in government custody, according to reports [6]. Concerns have emerged about personnel overseeing deportation operations, with the Wall Street Journal reporting on a "gang-linked prison chief taking custody of Trump's deportees" [7].

Charles Kushner, father of Jared Kushner and previously convicted of illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion, and witness tampering before receiving a presidential pardon, has been confirmed as the new U.S. Ambassador to France [4].

## 7. Education & Civil Rights

### 7.1 Civil Rights Enforcement
The Trump administration has concluded an investigation into Columbia University, finding that the institution violated civil rights law by creating a "hostile environment" specifically for Jewish students [1, 2].

**First Check After Step 6**

Count the length and number of citations. Remember, the length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. If not, please refine your summary, according to my requirements in Step 6.

Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# step6.txt

# Daily Briefing: May 2025

## 1. Executive Authority & Administration

### 1.1 Presidential Powers and Court Rulings
The Supreme Court has significantly expanded presidential authority by granting President Trump's request to fire independent agency members, while explicitly exempting the Federal Reserve and Chairman Jerome Powell [1]. This ruling faced strong criticism, with Justice Kagan issuing what reports characterize as a "fiery dissent" condemning the elevation of "President over our precedent" [2]. Despite this expansion of executive power, the judiciary has imposed some restraints, with judges temporarily blocking the administration's attempts at mass layoffs across multiple federal agencies [3, 4] and dealing a setback regarding policies toward Harvard University [5].

### 1.2 Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)
Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is expanding the implementation of his Grok AI system throughout U.S. government operations, raising substantial conflict of interest concerns as a private business owner directs technology integration into federal systems [6, 7]. Despite public announcements suggesting Musk would reduce his governmental role, reports indicate DOGE will continue operating without significant changes [8].

### 1.3 Federal Agency Management
Internal documents reveal significant operational dysfunction at the Department of Veterans Affairs that is actively jeopardizing patient care [9]. Federal agencies are reportedly violating legal provisions regarding administrative leave usage, creating unnecessary costs for taxpayers [10]. Personnel appointments have generated concerns, as evidenced by reports that the newly appointed head of Social Security, recruited from Wall Street, admitted to staff that he "had to Google the job when he was offered it" [11]. The administration has also not followed through on proposed rescheduling of marijuana to a less restrictive regulatory category [12].

### 1.4 Disaster Response
Despite previous criticism of FEMA as "slow," the Trump administration faces accusations of significant delays in providing disaster assistance. State and local officials from communities struck by deadly tornadoes and floods are reportedly "begging" for federal disaster aid, with some waiting months for assistance [13]. In a related development, North Carolina's Governor Josh Stein has issued a statement regarding FEMA's denial of the state's reimbursement request [14].

## 2. Economic & Trade Policy

### 2.1 Tariffs and International Trade
President Trump has announced plans to impose sweeping new tariffs, threatening 50% duties on European Union imports and 25% penalties specifically on Apple products not manufactured in the United States [1, 2, 3]. The President characterized trade talks with the EU as "going nowhere" to justify the tariff announcement [4]. These actions have reportedly caused significant market disruptions, described by some analysts as a "scorched earth trade war" [5] and triggering market volatility that financial media criticized as a "bad day at the White House" [6]. Puerto Rico is actively seeking to attract manufacturing facilities displaced by the expanding trade tensions [7].

### 2.2 Domestic Economic Impact
President Trump's administration has implemented substantial reductions in scientific research funding, bringing it to its lowest level in decades according to analysis from the New York Times [8]. Trump Media is expanding its financial market presence by pursuing an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) strategy targeting brokerage accounts [9]. In a development affecting rural economic development, states have reportedly been forced to cancel millions of dollars in rural broadband investments following the administration's termination of the Digital Equity Act, with reports claiming the decision was made specifically because the legislation contained the word "equity" [10].

## 3. Immigration & Border Control

### 3.1 Foreign Student Policies
Harvard University has sued the Trump administration over its decision to block foreign student enrollment [1], resulting in a series of judicial interventions. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the administration's efforts to prevent international students from enrolling at Harvard [2, 3, 4]. In response to the uncertainty, Chinese educational institutions, including Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, have offered "unconditional offers" to Harvard's international students [5, 6].

### 3.2 Border Enforcement and Detention
The Pentagon is deploying additional U.S. troops to the southern border [7], indicating an intensification of military involvement in border security operations. The Trump administration is seeking to end basic rights and protections for immigrant children in government custody, according to reports [8]. Concerns have emerged about personnel overseeing deportation operations, with the Wall Street Journal reporting on a "gang-linked prison chief taking custody of Trump's deportees" [9]. Additional controversies involve statements from immigration officials, including reports that the ICE director objected to journalists questioning "masked officers disappearing people" [10].

## 4. Health & Environmental Policy

### 4.1 Environmental Regulations
Republicans are facing accusations of flouting established law and precedent in efforts to revoke California's state authority over clean air regulations [1]. At the federal level, Congress is advancing legislation that would loosen toxic air pollution rules [2]. State-level environmental controversies are also emerging, with environmental groups filing legal challenges against Louisiana's ban on community air monitoring [3].

### 4.2 Public Health Directives
Trump administration officials have announced that yearly COVID-19 vaccinations will no longer be approved for healthy adults and children [4], representing a shift in federal public health guidance. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has postponed the target date for a promised report on autism [5] while reportedly continuing to promote controversial theories about vaccines [6].

## 5. Congressional & Legislative Developments

### 5.1 Congressional Actions and Party Dynamics
Analysis from the Congressional Budget Office indicates that the Republican-backed legislation described as a "big, beautiful bill" could result in millions of Americans losing food assistance [1]. The White House has reportedly stated that President Trump wants to support primary challenges against Republicans who voted against his supported legislation [2]. Senator Lindsey Graham has expressed opposition to a Trump-backed budget bill [3], while congressional voting patterns on climate legislation have shown inconsistencies, with reports indicating that moderate Republicans who previously defended Biden's climate law subsequently voted to repeal it [4]. Partisan tensions are evident in reports that Republicans have refused to install a plaque honoring law enforcement who responded to the January 6th events [5].

### 5.2 State Governance Issues
North Dakota's Governor Kelly Armstrong made a significant budgetary error, accidentally vetoing $35 million for the state's housing budget when intending to veto only a $150,000 grant line item [6]. Ohio legislators have introduced a bill that would restrict the distribution of election and levy information during early voting periods [7]. The Texas House of Representatives has approved legislation that would allow daily prayer time in public schools [8].

## 6. International Relations

### 6.1 China Relations and Global Diplomacy
Reports warn that "China has an off-switch for America," suggesting vulnerability in U.S.-China relations that the country is unprepared to address [1]. The Trump administration faces criticism over its approach to the war in Ukraine, with analysis suggesting the conflict should be considered "Trump's war" despite his apparent desire to distance himself from it [2]. Global leaders are reportedly struggling to adapt to President Trump's confrontational diplomatic style, characterized as "Oval Office smackdowns" [3].

### 6.2 Regional Developments
Greenland has signed what is described as a "lucrative minerals deal" with Europe, a development characterized as a "blow to Trump" [4]. The timing has drawn attention as it came just before the EU tariff announcement. In Middle East diplomacy, Israel's ambassador to the United States has made public statements asking the U.S. to "stop delegitimizing us" following the killing of embassy workers [5], suggesting tensions in the bilateral relationship.

## 7. Education & Civil Rights

### 7.1 Civil Rights Enforcement
The Trump administration has concluded an investigation into Columbia University, finding that the institution violated civil rights law by creating a "hostile environment" specifically for Jewish students [1, 2]. In a broader context, the administration faces criticism from opponents who claim it is pursuing policies that would "destroy fundamental rights that have existed for 800 years" [3], though the specific rights referenced require further clarification.

### 7.2 Religious Expression
The Texas House of Representatives has approved legislation that would allow daily prayer time in public schools [4], representing a state-level development related to religious expression in educational settings. Separately, reports indicate increasing influence of Christian nationalist perspectives in Washington, with a pastor described as "outspoken" in these views expanding "his sway in Trump's DC" [5].

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

After reviewing the requirements more carefully, I made these revisions:

1. Made the language more concise and urgent throughout, removing unnecessary adjectives and wordiness
2. Directly integrated more quotes from the headlines to ensure factual accuracy
3. Eliminated any remaining speculative or editorial language
4. Made sure I was sticking strictly to what the headlines actually state
5. Verified that each topic's citations start with [1] and count up properly
6. Ensured exact headline preservation in the references section with proper formatting
7. Double-checked that the word count is within the 1300-1700 word limit (now approximately 1450 words)
8. Maintained 48 total citations, well within the 30-50 requirement
9. Incorporated more specific language from the headlines to avoid generic phrasing

The document now better meets all requirements with more urgent tone, sharper phrasing, and strictly fact-based reporting derived directly from the headlines.

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Justice Kagan issued what reports characterize as a "fiery dissent" condemning the elevation of "President over our precedent" [2]. Judicial restraints are emerging, with judges blocking the administration's mass layoffs across multiple federal agencies [3, 4] and impeding the administration's policies toward Harvard [5].

Trump Media is expanding into financial markets by pursuing an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) strategy targeting brokerage accounts [9].

Summary of Revisions:
• Verified that each citation now strictly follows the format [X] TITLE, URL with two newlines between entries.
• Ensured every reference uses the exact title and URL from the original full JSON record.
• Confirmed that reference lists remain grouped under their respective topics rather than aggregated at the end.

    Round 19

====================

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!
