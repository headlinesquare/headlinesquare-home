# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Authority & Administration

### 1.1 Presidential Powers and Court Rulings
The Supreme Court has dramatically expanded presidential authority by granting President Trump's request to fire independent agency members, while explicitly exempting the Federal Reserve and Chairman Jerome Powell [1]. Justice Kagan issued what reports characterize as a "fiery dissent" condemning the elevation of "President over our precedent" [2]. Judicial restraints are emerging, with judges blocking the administration's mass layoffs across multiple federal agencies [3] [4] and impeding the administration's policies toward Harvard [5].

The newly appointed head of Social Security, recruited from Wall Street, told staff he "had to Google the job when he was offered it" [11]. The administration has failed to follow through on proposed rescheduling of marijuana to a less restrictive regulatory category [12].

## 2. Economic & Trade Policy

### 2.1 Tariffs and International Trade
President Trump announced sweeping new tariffs, including 50% duties on European Union imports [1] and 25% penalties on Apple products not manufactured in the United States [2] [3]. He justified the EU tariff decision by claiming trade talks were "going nowhere" [4]. These actions triggered significant market disruptions, described by analysts as a "scorched earth trade war" [5] and prompted financial media criticism following market volatility [6]. Puerto Rico is actively pursuing manufacturing facilities displaced by escalating trade tensions [7].
