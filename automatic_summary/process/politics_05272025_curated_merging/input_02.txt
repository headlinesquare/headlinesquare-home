## 1. Executive Actions And Federal Policy

### 1.1 Executive Orders And Federal Funding

The Trump administration continues to reshape federal policy through executive orders [1], while targeting specific institutions for funding cuts.

This action comes amid what Democracy Now characterizes as escalating tensions between the administration and academic institutions [4]. In a separate funding dispute, the Government Accountability Office has ruled that the Transportation Department cannot withhold funds from the electric vehicle infrastructure program [5].
