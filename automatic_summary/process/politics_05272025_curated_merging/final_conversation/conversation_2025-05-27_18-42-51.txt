**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

---

Because there are several hundreds of news articles posted in some subreddit communities every day, it is hard to summarize all of them in a single process. Fortunately, I have already broken the articles in that day into chunks by submission time in the 24 hour coverage window in ascending order, and generated summaries for each chunk with LLMs. Those detailed summary chunks will be posted here. Each has a length of 1300-1700 words without counting the URLs, and citing 30-50 news articles. 

The chunks are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, there are 4 chunks, and the news coverage cycle is from yesterday's 18:00 to today's 18:00. Chunk 1 is from the articles submitted between 18:00 of yesterday to 06:00 of today, Chunk 2 is for 06:00 to 10:00 today, Chunk 3 is for 10:00 to 14:00 today, and Chunk 4 is from 14:00 to 18:00 today. The first chunk is based on the earliest articles submitted to the subreddit community. The last chunk is based on the latest articles submitted. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in Chunk 2 **happen** after all the news stories in Chunk 1, just because they are **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from Chunk 1 and B from Chunk 2, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This rule applies to all chunks in sequential order. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from different chunks. 

**Your task is to critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks, and then faithfully merge all of them into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks.** 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

---

Please tell me if you are ready to receive the individual summaries. I will provide them all at once. And please follow my later instructions, be patient, do the work step by step.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the individual summaries and analyze them to create a comprehensive Daily Briefing that both Democratic and Republican leadership can use to understand the current political landscape. I understand that factual accuracy is paramount, and I'll rely solely on the information provided in the news headlines, avoiding speculation based on my internal knowledge which may be outdated.

I'll carefully examine each summary chunk, identify key themes, assess potential biases, and synthesize the information into an objective summary that maintains the tone, format, and style of the original chunks. I will not make assumptions about titles or positions of individuals unless they are clearly stated in the provided information or in your reference lists.

Please provide the summary chunks, and I will process them thoroughly.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1**

Comparing:

Please critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks provided below. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You must use your limited length to summarize the most important news, while skipping the secondary.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.

Please carefully think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. **You will do the merging task in the next round with my detailed instructions. Please do not attempt to write down your summary at this step, because you haven't been given the full instructions yet!** It is always better to take some time to think clearly for such a difficult task, and make detailed plans for yourself, before taking any actions. You should use this opportunity to prepare yourself for your next round of work by writing down some notes for yourself.

This action comes amid what Democracy Now characterizes as escalating tensions between the administration and academic institutions [4]. In a separate funding dispute, the Government Accountability Office has ruled that the Transportation Department cannot withhold funds from the electric vehicle infrastructure program [5].

### 7.3 State-Level Political Developments

Political transitions continue at the state level. A key Senate seat may see turnover, with The Press Herald asking "Who will Maine Democrats run against Susan Collins?" [1]. Alabama may see new gubernatorial candidates, as AL.com reports speculation around whether "Tommy Tuberville announce[s] a run for governor of Alabama today" [2]. Educational policy faces political pressure, with People's World reporting "Oklahoma adds 2020 election lies to high school curriculum, expanding right-wing revisionism trend" [3]. Maryland Governor Wes Moore is making significant technology investments, with The Baltimore Banner reporting he is "betting $1 billion on qubits" [4].

## 8. Education And Academic Policy

### 8.1 Higher Education And Academic Freedom

Changes to higher education policy reflect administration priorities. Trump Media Technology Group Trump is moving to cancel Harvard's federal contracts worth approximately $100 million [1][2][3]. Democracy Now frames this as part of a broader conflict between "Trump vs. Academic Freedom" as the "President Escalates Attacks on Harvard & International Students" [4].

### 8.2 Academic Political Environment

The political environment within academia appears to be shifting. The Atlantic describes "The Era of DEI for Conservatives Has Begun" [1], suggesting increased initiatives to promote conservative viewpoints in higher education. Meanwhile, clarifications regarding public figures' finances have emerged, with Business Insider reporting "No, AOC is not worth millions of dollars" [2] in response to apparently widespread claims about Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's wealth.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Branch Actions

### 1.1 Immigration and Visa Policies

The Trump administration's deportation policies are creating immediate life‐threatening situations. A 4‐year‐old with a critical medical condition faces deportation that doctors warn could be "fatal within a matter of days" [1]. In another case, a gay man was deported to a country where he was subsequently raped, with allegations that administration officials "lied to the judge twice" during proceedings [2]. Student visa processing has been halted completely [3] as the administration prepares to implement "expanded social media vetting" for all foreign students [4]. Immigration enforcement has intensified at routine proceedings, with ICE arresting a high school student at what was described as a "routine immigration hearing" [5]. Border security has drawn scrutiny—not only for its cost, with reports that the Border Czar's security detail costs "taxpayers $1 million a month" [6]—but also amid claims that Trump's Border Czar profited from a top ICE contractor before taking a White House gig [7].

### 1.2 Federal Funding Decisions

The administration has implemented major funding reductions across multiple sectors. Veterans Affairs is facing "sweeping cuts" [1] while educational institutions have been singled out; President Trump has moved to "yank all remaining federal funds to Harvard" – language he used by describing the Ivy League school as "very antisemitic" [2]. Policy leverage is evident in funding threats too—California's federal funding has been threatened over a transgender athlete issue [3]. The administration's approach to public media has also come under fire, with NPR filing suit "over executive order to cut federal funding to public media" [4]. Personal political insults have also emerged in funding debates; Trump shared a social media post referring to former President Biden as a "decrepit corpse" soon after Biden's cancer diagnosis was publicized [5].

### 1.3 Presidential Pardons and Department Affairs

President Trump is using his pardon power extensively for political allies. The administration has issued pardons for "political allies and loyalists" [1], with his new pardon attorney personally reviewing an application for Stewart Rhodes, described as a "Jan. 6 ringleader" [2]. Pardons have also been extended to reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, previously convicted of bank fraud and tax crimes [3]. Meanwhile, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is driving agency changes: the Bureau of Land Management ousted an official for "resisting DOGE" [4] while reports indicate DOGE's "5 things emails are dying a slow, quiet death" [5]. At Health and Human Services, Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed barring government scientists from publishing in leading medical journals [6], and his health policies reportedly exclude "most pregnant women or children" [7].

## 2. Foreign Policy

### 2.1 Russia-Ukraine Conflict

Military tensions with Russia are intensifying as the U.S. reinforces Europe's northern front amid fears of a wider conflict [1]. President Trump has presented contradictory messages: on one hand admitting he has "no way to make Putin stop" as bombs fall on Kyiv [2], and on the other claiming he has protected Russia from "really bad things" [3]. In further statements, Trump warned Putin that he was "playing with fire" and suggested that Russia had avoided severe consequences thanks to his intervention [4]. These remarks have drawn harsh criticism from Russian media [5] and even triggered responses from automated online accounts [6].

### 2.2 International Trade and Diplomacy

Diplomatic efforts under the current administration face significant challenges. A ceasefire agreement negotiated to release hostages was rejected by Israel, with blame assigned to Hamas [1]. U.S. trade relations have deteriorated, with the U.S. and EU locked in a "showdown over trade" concerning what Trump wants and what Europe can deliver [2]. Tariff policies are described as causing a "tariff whiplash" – a "death by a thousand cuts" [3]. Meanwhile, international market shifts are evident as "Turkish guns are taking over U.S. and global markets" [4]. Additionally, the State Department has advised against travel to Venezuela due to risks such as torture and kidnapping [5]. In a peculiar diplomatic twist, Canada reminded Trump that it already has a King [6] after he proposed making Canada the 51st state [7].

## 3. Judicial and Legal Developments

The Supreme Court is entering a decisive phase as it is "poised to decide cases on birthright citizenship, transgender care and religion" [1]. It recently declined to hear the Oak Flat case, which would have paved the way for a large-scale copper mine on sacred Native American land [2]. Meanwhile, executive orders from the administration have sparked legal challenges—one judge blasted an order targeting a major law firm as "Absurd!" [3] and NPR has initiated a lawsuit over funding cuts for public media [4]. There are also broader concerns that Congress and the Supreme Court are "trying to undermine lower court judges" [5].

## 4. Congressional Affairs

### 4.1 Federal Program Battles

A high-stakes battle is underway in Congress over the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared "Hands off SNAP" on the House floor [1], while Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro criticized Republicans for "ripping away Medicaid and SNAP from Pennsylvanians" [2]. There are also concerns that more than 3 million people could lose SNAP benefits under a GOP bill [3]. Meanwhile, tensions over judicial appointments have escalated; Senator Dick Durbin announced plans to "stall Trump U.S. attorney picks," citing delays attributed to JD Vance under Biden's tenure [4].

### 4.2 Political Positioning

Politicians are gearing up for the 2026 election cycle. Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville has announced his bid for Alabama governor in 2026 [1], while Democrats are strategizing to regain ground in the South with a renewed focus on the working class [2]. Meanwhile, Representative Crockett made headlines by "likening Trump to someone who escaped an insane asylum" [3], and discussion has even emerged about recruiting nontraditional candidates, with GOP chatters considering Auburn coach Bruce Pearl for Senate [4].

## 5. Social Issues

### 5.1 Civil Rights and Religious Expression

State policies on gender-affirming care are under scientific scrutiny. A state-commissioned study in Utah found that the ban on gender-affirming pediatric care "cannot be justified" by science, according to a two-year review [1]. Meanwhile, national concerns persist over growing antisemitism and political violence [2]—with one report urging that "Antisemitic DC killings must be a wake-up call for NYC voters" [3]. Environmental and employment issues also arise as chemical plants near Black neighborhoods continue to pollute while hiring few Black workers [4]. In matters of religious expression, Oklahoma's schools will include Bibles despite funding shortfalls [5], Texas lawmakers now require the Ten Commandments in every classroom [6], and state treasurers have reportedly joined a Christian supremacist effort targeting public investments [7].

### 5.2 State Governance

State-level policies continue to evolve. A ruling by the Missouri State Supreme Court led to "Abortions canceled again in Missouri" [1] while in Texas a bill to block abortion pills has temporarily died [2]. Texas is also showing mixed signals—expanding legal cannabis access before a wider ban [3] even as its governor signs a law to enforce age verification on Apple and Google app stores [4]. Urban policy debates continue in New York City, where congestion pricing remains on the agenda [5]. In financial regulation, New York is considering a ban on officials profiting from cryptocurrency [6] amid warnings that "Donald Trump's Media Conglomerate Is Becoming a Bitcoin Reserve" [7].

# Step 1: Analysis of Summary Chunks

After reviewing the three summary chunks, I can identify several key themes and topics that appear across multiple chunks, as well as unique areas covered in individual chunks. Here's my analysis of similarities, differences, and a plan for hierarchical categories for the merged summary:

## Common Themes Across Summaries

1. **Executive Actions and Pardons**
   - Presidential pardons are covered extensively across chunks, including pardons for former sheriff Scott Jenkins, tax cheat Paul Walczak, and reality TV stars
   - Executive orders affecting funding for various entities (Harvard, NPR, etc.)
   - Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) activities

2. **Russia-Ukraine Relations**
   - Trump-Putin dynamics
   - Prisoner exchange agreements
   - Potential sanctions
   - Ceasefire negotiations
   - Trump's public statements about Putin "playing with fire"

3. **Immigration Policy**
   - Deportation actions
   - Student visa restrictions/halts
   - Border security measures and controversies
   - Humanitarian concerns about deportees

4. **Legal Challenges to Administration**
   - NPR lawsuit over funding cuts
   - Judicial responses to executive orders
   - Supreme Court decisions and cases

5. **Federal Funding Decisions**
   - Harvard funding cuts
   - Public media funding
   - Veterans Affairs cuts
   - Transportation funding disputes

6. **Congressional Politics**
   - Budget battles
   - Party strategies for upcoming elections
   - Social program debates (SNAP, Medicaid)

## Differences Between Summaries

- **Chunk 1** focuses more on international diplomacy, military affairs, and constitutional issues
- **Chunk 2** has more coverage of state legislation, health policy changes, and demographic voter analysis
- **Chunk 3** provides more details on civil rights issues, state court decisions on abortion, and RFK Jr.'s policies at HHS

## Proposed Hierarchical Structure for Merged Summary

1. **Executive Branch Actions**
   - Presidential Orders and Directives
   - Federal Funding Decisions
   - Presidential Pardons
   - Cabinet and Department Activities

2. **Foreign Policy**
   - Russia-Ukraine Relations
   - International Trade and Tariffs
   - Other International Relations

3. **Immigration and Border Security**
   - Deportation Policies and Humanitarian Concerns
   - Visa Restrictions
   - Border Enforcement

4. **Legal and Constitutional Issues**
   - Supreme Court Actions
   - Legal Challenges to Administration Policies
   - Constitutional Concerns

5. **Domestic Policy**
   - Social Programs and Healthcare
   - Education Initiatives and Funding
   - Environmental and Energy Policy

6. **Congressional Affairs**
   - Budget Battles
   - Party Politics and Electoral Positioning

7. **State and Local Developments**
   - State Legislation on Social Issues
   - State-Federal Tensions

## Key Consideration for Merging

I notice that all three summary chunks follow a somewhat similar format with numbered sections and subsections, quoted headlines, and references. The merged summary should maintain this format while being selective about which news items to prioritize.

The most important and recurring topics appear to be:
1. Russian relations and Trump-Putin dynamics
2. Immigration policies and their humanitarian impact
3. Federal funding decisions targeting specific institutions
4. Presidential pardons and their controversial nature
5. Legal challenges to administration policies

These should receive primary focus in the merged summary, while less prominent or one-time mentions can be condensed or omitted to maintain appropriate length.

I will aim to create a balanced summary that accurately reflects the breadth of topics covered while focusing on the most significant developments, following the hierarchical structure outlined above.


====================
    Round 3
    User: 
====================

**Step 2**

Merging:

Please faithfully merge all summary chunks into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks. 

Length Requirement: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

You must make sure all the news facts are accurate, news titles are accurate, and the URLs are precise. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical, because they were individually determined by LLMs. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You can reference to the merged hierarchical categories in the last round, and you can refine the categories if you like.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.  Although the citations have already been carefully selected, some articles are still better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. In that case, please think carefully and pick up the most important contents within the constraint of the total word count and number of citations. **In each topic, the citations count from [1].**

Please first think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. Then, think intelligently, and write the entire summary.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Use readable and accessible language. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Length Requirement Repeated for Emphasis: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

Please directly produce daily_briefing.txt containing your new summary, without asking for my permission.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Branch Actions

### 1.1 Presidential Directives and Federal Funding

The Trump administration continues reshaping federal policy through executive orders [1] while targeting specific institutions for funding cuts. The administration is moving to cancel approximately $100 million in federal contracts with Harvard University [2], with Trump describing the school as "very antisemitic" [3]. President Trump has also threatened to redirect $3 billion in federal grants from Harvard to trade schools [4] and to withhold California's federal funding over a transgender athlete issue [5].

NPR and Colorado public radio stations have filed legal action against the Trump White House over an executive order cutting federal funding [6]. The Government Accountability Office has ruled that the Transportation Department cannot withhold funds from the electric vehicle infrastructure program [7], and New York has won a bid to stop the U.S. from freezing funds in a congestion pricing dispute [8].

### 1.2 Presidential Pardons

President Trump has issued several controversial pardons. He pardoned former Virginia sheriff Scott Jenkins, who was convicted of fraud and bribery [1] and sentenced to 10 years for what one report describes as a "cash-for-badges scheme" [2]. The Independent claims Jenkins took more than $75,000 in bribes, and reports that President Trump described him as a "wonderful person" [3].

The New York Times reports that Trump pardoned a tax cheat after the individual's mother attended a $1 million dinner at Mar-a-Lago [4]. The Daily Beast identifies this person as Paul Walczak, who allegedly "stole from his employees to fund an extravagant lifestyle" [5]. Trump has also pardoned reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, previously convicted of bank fraud and tax crimes [6]. Additionally, Trump's new pardon attorney personally reviewed an application for Jan. 6 ringleader Stewart Rhodes [7].

### 1.3 Department and Agency Activities

The Trump EPA is reportedly drafting a rule that would "undo decades of progress on limiting pollution from power plants" [1]. At the Department of Health and Human Services, Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has revoked COVID-19 shot recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women [2] and has proposed barring government scientists from publishing in leading medical journals [3].

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is driving agency changes: the Bureau of Land Management ousted an official for "resisting DOGE" [4], while reports indicate DOGE's "5 things emails are dying a slow, quiet death" [5]. The New York Sun reports challenges for "Musk and DOGE" as "Congress Tees Up Immense Increase in Federal Deficit Spending" [6].

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth faces internal and legal challenges. The Washington Post reports "Within Pete Hegseth's divided inner circle, a 'cold war' endures" [7], while The New Republic states Hegseth was "Hit With Stunning Illegal Wiretap Allegations" [8].

## 2. Foreign Relations

### 2.1 Russia-Ukraine Relations

Russia has announced a prisoner exchange agreement with President Trump [1], while the administration is considering imposing new sanctions against Russia according to Wall Street Journal reporting [2]. Headlines indicate President Trump is growing "angrier" as Putin allegedly "exposes his impotence" in their relationship [3].

Military tensions with Russia are intensifying as the U.S. reinforces Europe's northern front amid fears of a wider conflict [4]. President Trump has presented contradictory messages: on one hand admitting he has "no way to make Putin stop" as bombs fall on Kyiv [5], and on the other warning Putin he is "playing with fire" [6] and claiming he has protected Russia from "really bad things" [7]. These remarks have drawn criticism from Russian media [8].

### 2.2 International Trade and Diplomacy

U.S. trade relations have deteriorated, with the U.S. and EU locked in a "showdown over trade" concerning what Trump wants and what Europe can deliver [1]. The EU is reportedly "counting on Trump to blink first in trade spat" [2]. Tourists from countries hit by Trump tariffs are reportedly avoiding travel to the U.S. [3], and businesses affected by Trump's tariffs are seeking refunds [4].

Diplomatic efforts under the current administration face significant challenges. A ceasefire agreement negotiated to release hostages was rejected by Israel, with blame assigned to Hamas [5]. The New York Times suggests Trump envisions "One World, Three Powers" in his foreign policy approach [6]. The U.S. is reportedly negotiating with Venezuela to allow increased oil sales in exchange for accepting more deportees [7].

## 3. Immigration and Border Policies

### 3.1 Deportation and Humanitarian Concerns

The Trump administration's deportation policies are creating life-threatening situations. A 4-year-old with a critical medical condition faces deportation that doctors warn could be "fatal within a matter of days" [1]. In another case, a gay man was deported to a country where he was subsequently raped, with allegations that administration officials "lied to the judge twice" during proceedings [2].

Immigration enforcement has intensified, with ICE reportedly arresting a high school student at a "routine immigration hearing" [3] and tapping into a "nationwide AI-enabled camera network" with "automatic license plate reader cameras in more than 5,000 communities" [4]. Border security has drawn scrutiny for its cost, with reports that the Border Czar's security detail costs "taxpayers $1 million a month" [5].

[1] Trump's Deportation Efforts Are About to Kill a 4-Year-Old - Doctors for the child, who has a life-threatening medical condition, say that stopping her treatment could prove fatal "within a matter of days.", https://newrepublic.com/post/195741/donald-trump-deportation-kill-four-year-old

### 3.2 Visa Restrictions and Border Management

The administration has halted student visa processing, with Bloomberg reporting "Trump pauses all Student Visa Vetting Interviews" [1] and The Guardian confirming this policy change [2]. This pause comes as the government reportedly prepares to implement "expanded social media vetting" for all foreign students [3].

The Washington Post reports potential conflicts of interest, noting that "Trump's border czar consulted for immigrant detention firm GEO Group" [4]. A judge has accused the Trump administration of "manufacturing chaos in migrant deportation case" [5], and NBC News reports that Venezuelans legally in the U.S. under Temporary Protected Status are seeing their lives "upended" by a Supreme Court order on TPS [6].

## 4. Legal and Constitutional Issues

### 4.1 Judicial System Challenges

The Supreme Court is entering a decisive phase as it is "poised to decide cases on birthright citizenship, transgender care and religion" [1]. It recently declined to hear the Oak Flat case, which would have paved the way for a large-scale copper mine on sacred Native American land [2]. The Court also "rejects case about student's 'There are only two genders' T-shirt" [3].

The Atlantic reports the executive branch may be circumventing court orders while maintaining the appearance of compliance [4]. The Guardian suggests the Republican budget bill contains a "hidden measure" that would dramatically increase presidential power [5]. A letter warns that a provision in the House budget bill could block courts from enforcing contempt rulings [6].

## 5. Domestic Policy

### 5.1 Social Programs and Healthcare

A high-stakes battle is underway in Congress over the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared "Hands off SNAP" on the House floor [1], while Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro criticized Republicans for "ripping away Medicaid and SNAP from Pennsylvanians" [2]. There are concerns that more than 3 million people could lose SNAP benefits under a GOP bill [3].

Work requirements are reportedly "better at blocking benefits for low-income people than they are at helping those folks find jobs" [4]. Multiple outlets suggest the Trump administration plans significant changes to Medicaid, with advisers acknowledging cuts [5]. A program helping 6 million families pay energy bills may be at risk according to reporting [6].

### 5.2 Economic Impact and Business

Trump's media company is making a significant cryptocurrency investment, with The Verge reporting plans to "buy $2.5 billion in Bitcoin" [1]. President Trump has stated that the U.S. "will control US Steel as part of Nippon deal" [2]. A study indicates the U.S. could lose $23 billion in GDP and 230,000 jobs if foreign tourists stay away due to tariffs [3]. NPR reports that "Corporate America's retreat from DEI has eliminated thousands of jobs" [4].

## 6. State and Party Politics

### 6.1 Party Strategies and Electoral Outlook

Politicians are gearing up for the 2026 election cycle. Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville has announced his bid for Alabama governor in 2026 [1]. The Washington Post suggests "A 'Blue Wave' is building" though "It won't look the same as the last one" [2]. Democrats are discussing how to "win back working class and gain young male support" [3].

Representative Jasmine Crockett has stated Democrats "Will Investigate Trump if They Reclaim the House in the Midterms" [4]. The Democratic Party appears to be reassessing strategy, with reports the party is "scrambling to fix image" as members acknowledge it has "lost credibility" [5]. Republicans are reportedly putting pressure on Trump over Russia, with one quoted saying "Putin has been jerking us around" [6].

**Step 3**

Length Control:

Now, it is the time to take a look at your document length again. Before you do anything else, count the words (without counting the URLs) and number of citations, and explicitly write those out. 

See if they fit to the desired range: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

If not, please refine your summary, according to my requirements in Step 2. Especially, you should not make the language technical or dry, after you shortened the text. The language should always be readable and accessible. If you find other mistakes, please directly correct them. 

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You should produce the new daily_briefing.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Branch Actions

### 1.1 Presidential Directives and Federal Funding

The Trump administration continues reshaping federal policy through executive orders [1] while targeting specific institutions for funding cuts. The administration is moving to cancel approximately $100 million in federal contracts with Harvard University [2], with Trump describing the school as "very antisemitic" [3]. President Trump has also threatened to redirect $3 billion in federal grants from Harvard to trade schools [4] and to withhold California's federal funding over a transgender athlete issue [5].

NPR and Colorado public radio stations have filed legal action against the Trump White House over an executive order cutting federal funding [6]. The Government Accountability Office has ruled that the Transportation Department cannot withhold funds from the electric vehicle infrastructure program [7], and New York has won a bid to stop the U.S. from freezing funds in a congestion pricing dispute [8].

### 1.2 Presidential Pardons

President Trump has issued several controversial pardons. He pardoned former Virginia sheriff Scott Jenkins, who was convicted of fraud and bribery [1] and sentenced to 10 years for what one report describes as a "cash-for-badges scheme" [2]. The New York Times reports that Trump pardoned tax cheat Paul Walczak after his mother attended a $1 million dinner at Mar-a-Lago [3]. Trump has also pardoned reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, previously convicted of bank fraud and tax crimes [4]. Additionally, Trump's new pardon attorney personally reviewed an application for Jan. 6 ringleader Stewart Rhodes [5].

### 1.3 Department and Agency Activities

The Trump EPA is reportedly drafting a rule that would "undo decades of progress on limiting pollution from power plants" [1]. At the Department of Health and Human Services, Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has revoked COVID-19 shot recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women [2] and has proposed barring government scientists from publishing in leading medical journals [3].

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is facing challenges with the Bureau of Land Management reportedly ousting an official for "resisting DOGE" [4], while reports indicate DOGE's "5 things emails are dying a slow, quiet death" [5]. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth faces internal challenges and legal allegations including reports of illegal wiretapping [6].

## 2. Foreign Relations

### 2.1 Russia-Ukraine Relations

Russia has announced a prisoner exchange agreement with President Trump [1], while the administration is considering imposing new sanctions against Russia according to Wall Street Journal reporting [2]. Military tensions with Russia are intensifying as the U.S. reinforces Europe's northern front amid fears of a wider conflict [3].

President Trump has presented contradictory messages: admitting he has "no way to make Putin stop" as bombs fall on Kyiv [4], while also warning Putin he is "playing with fire" [5] and claiming he has protected Russia from "really bad things" [6]. These remarks have drawn criticism from Russian media [7], and Republicans are reportedly putting pressure on Trump over Russia, with one quoted saying "Putin has been jerking us around" [8].

### 2.2 International Trade and Diplomacy

U.S. trade relations have deteriorated, with the U.S. and EU locked in a "showdown over trade" [1]. The EU is reportedly "counting on Trump to blink first in trade spat" [2]. Tourists from countries hit by Trump tariffs are reportedly avoiding travel to the U.S. [3], and businesses affected by Trump's tariffs are seeking refunds [4].

The New York Times suggests Trump envisions "One World, Three Powers" in his foreign policy approach [5]. A ceasefire agreement negotiated to release hostages was rejected by Israel, with blame assigned to Hamas [6]. The U.S. is reportedly negotiating with Venezuela to allow increased oil sales in exchange for accepting more deportees [7].

## 3. Immigration and Border Policies

### 3.1 Deportation and Visa Restrictions

The Trump administration's deportation policies are creating urgent situations. A 4-year-old with a critical medical condition faces deportation that doctors warn could be fatal "within a matter of days" [1]. In another case, a gay man was deported to a country where he was subsequently raped, with allegations that administration officials "lied to the judge twice" during proceedings [2].

The administration has halted student visa processing, with Bloomberg reporting "Trump pauses all Student Visa Vetting Interviews" [3]. This pause comes as the government reportedly prepares to implement "expanded social media vetting" for all foreign students [4]. Meanwhile, Venezuelans legally in the U.S. under Temporary Protected Status are seeing their lives "upended" by a Supreme Court order on TPS [5].

### 3.2 Border Enforcement

Immigration enforcement has intensified, with ICE reportedly arresting a high school student at a "routine immigration hearing" [1] and tapping into a "nationwide AI-enabled camera network" [2]. Border security has drawn scrutiny, with reports that the Border Czar's security detail costs "taxpayers $1 million a month" [3].

The Washington Post reports potential conflicts of interest, noting that "Trump's border czar consulted for immigrant detention firm GEO Group" [4]. A judge has accused the Trump administration of "manufacturing chaos in migrant deportation case" [5].

## 4. Legal and Constitutional Issues

The Supreme Court is entering a decisive phase as it is "poised to decide cases on birthright citizenship, transgender care and religion" [1]. It recently declined to hear the Oak Flat case, which would have paved the way for a large-scale copper mine on sacred Native American land [2], and rejected a case about a student's "There are only two genders" T-shirt [3].

The Atlantic reports the executive branch may be circumventing court orders while maintaining the appearance of compliance [4]. The Guardian suggests the Republican budget bill contains a "hidden measure" that would dramatically increase presidential power [5]. A letter warns that a provision in the House budget bill could block courts from enforcing contempt rulings [6].

## 5. Domestic Policy and Economic Issues

### 5.1 Social Programs

A high-stakes battle is underway in Congress over the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared "Hands off SNAP" on the House floor [1], while Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro criticized Republicans for "ripping away Medicaid and SNAP from Pennsylvanians" [2]. There are concerns that more than 3 million people could lose SNAP benefits under a GOP bill [3].

Work requirements are reportedly "better at blocking benefits for low-income people than they are at helping those folks find jobs" [4]. Multiple outlets suggest the Trump administration plans significant changes to Medicaid, with advisers acknowledging cuts [5]. A program helping 6 million families pay energy bills may also be at risk [6].

### 5.2 Economic Developments

Trump's media company is making a significant cryptocurrency investment, with The Verge reporting plans to "buy $2.5 billion in Bitcoin" [1]. President Trump has stated that the U.S. "will control US Steel as part of Nippon deal" [2]. A study indicates the U.S. could lose $23 billion in GDP and 230,000 jobs if foreign tourists stay away due to tariffs [3]. NPR reports that "Corporate America's retreat from DEI has eliminated thousands of jobs" [4].

## 6. Political Strategies and Electoral Outlook

Politicians are gearing up for the 2026 election cycle. Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville has announced his bid for Alabama governor in 2026 [1]. The Washington Post suggests "A 'Blue Wave' is building" though "It won't look the same as the last one" [2]. Democrats are discussing how to "win back working class and gain young male support" [3].

The Democratic Party appears to be reassessing strategy, with reports the party is "scrambling to fix image" as members acknowledge it has "lost credibility" [4]. Representative Jasmine Crockett has stated Democrats "Will Investigate Trump if They Reclaim the House in the Midterms" [5].

    Round 5

====================

**Step 4**

Finalizing:

Now, it is the time to finalize your summary.

It is still quite likely that you made some factual mistakes. Please do a very careful, independent review of your summary. **Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

After you check the facts, you should also carefully check the tone, format, style and length. Use readable and accessible language. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

If you find mistakes, please directly correct them. It is time to produce the final daily_briefing.md, in simple Markdown format, without asking for my permission. 

Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing.

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

--- 


Right before you start printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `daily_briefing.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made. Thank you very much for all your hard work!


====================
    Round 5
    Assistant: 
====================

I'll carefully review and ensure the final daily_briefing.md contains accurate information without hallucinations, preserving exact news titles and URLs. I'll check the tone, format, style, and length according to the specifications.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Branch Actions

### 1.1 Presidential Directives and Federal Funding

The Trump administration continues reshaping federal policy through executive orders [1] while targeting specific institutions for funding cuts. The administration is moving to cancel approximately $100 million in federal contracts with Harvard University [2], with Trump describing the school as "very antisemitic" [3]. President Trump has also threatened to redirect $3 billion in federal grants from Harvard to trade schools [4] and to withhold California's federal funding over a transgender athlete issue [5].

NPR and Colorado public radio stations have filed legal action against the Trump White House over an executive order cutting federal funding [6]. The Government Accountability Office has ruled that the Transportation Department cannot withhold funds from the electric vehicle infrastructure program [7], and New York has won a bid to stop the U.S. from freezing funds in a congestion pricing dispute [8].

### 1.2 Presidential Pardons

President Trump has issued several controversial pardons. He pardoned former Virginia sheriff Scott Jenkins, who was convicted of fraud and bribery [1] and sentenced to 10 years for what one report describes as a "cash-for-badges scheme" [2]. The New York Times reports that Trump pardoned tax cheat Paul Walczak after his mother attended a $1 million dinner at Mar-a-Lago [3]. Trump has also pardoned reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, previously convicted of bank fraud and tax crimes [4]. Additionally, Trump's new pardon attorney personally reviewed an application for Jan. 6 ringleader Stewart Rhodes [5].

### 1.3 Department and Agency Activities

The Trump EPA is reportedly drafting a rule that would "undo decades of progress on limiting pollution from power plants" [1]. At the Department of Health and Human Services, Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has revoked COVID-19 shot recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women [2] and has proposed barring government scientists from publishing in leading medical journals [3].

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is facing challenges with the Bureau of Land Management reportedly ousting an official for "resisting DOGE" [4], while reports indicate DOGE's "5 things emails are dying a slow, quiet death" [5]. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth faces internal challenges and legal allegations including reports of illegal wiretapping [6].

## 2. Foreign Relations

### 2.1 Russia-Ukraine Relations

Russia has announced a prisoner exchange agreement with President Trump [1], while the administration is considering imposing new sanctions against Russia according to Wall Street Journal reporting [2]. Military tensions with Russia are intensifying as the U.S. reinforces Europe's northern front amid fears of a wider conflict [3].

President Trump has presented contradictory messages: admitting he has "no way to make Putin stop" as bombs fall on Kyiv [4], while also warning Putin he is "playing with fire" [5] and claiming he has protected Russia from "really bad things" [6]. These remarks have drawn criticism from Russian media [7], and Republicans are reportedly putting pressure on Trump over Russia, with one quoted saying "Putin has been jerking us around" [8].

### 2.2 International Trade and Diplomacy

U.S. trade relations have deteriorated, with the U.S. and EU locked in a "showdown over trade" [1]. The EU is reportedly "counting on Trump to blink first in trade spat" [2]. Tourists from countries hit by Trump tariffs are reportedly avoiding travel to the U.S. [3], and businesses affected by Trump's tariffs are seeking refunds [4].

The New York Times suggests Trump envisions "One World, Three Powers" in his foreign policy approach [5]. A ceasefire agreement negotiated to release hostages was rejected by Israel, with blame assigned to Hamas [6]. The U.S. is reportedly negotiating with Venezuela to allow increased oil sales in exchange for accepting more deportees [7].

## 3. Immigration and Border Policies

### 3.1 Deportation and Visa Restrictions

The Trump administration's deportation policies are creating urgent situations. A 4-year-old with a critical medical condition faces deportation that doctors warn could be fatal "within a matter of days" [1]. In another case, a gay man was deported to a country where he was subsequently raped, with allegations that administration officials "lied to the judge twice" during proceedings [2].

The administration has halted student visa processing, with Bloomberg reporting "Trump pauses all Student Visa Vetting Interviews" [3]. This pause comes as the government reportedly prepares to implement "expanded social media vetting" for all foreign students [4]. Meanwhile, Venezuelans legally in the U.S. under Temporary Protected Status are seeing their lives "upended" by a Supreme Court order on TPS [5].

### 3.2 Border Enforcement

Immigration enforcement has intensified, with ICE reportedly arresting a high school student at a "routine immigration hearing" [1] and tapping into a "nationwide AI-enabled camera network" [2]. Border security has drawn scrutiny, with reports that the Border Czar's security detail costs "taxpayers $1 million a month" [3].

The Washington Post reports potential conflicts of interest, noting that "Trump's border czar consulted for immigrant detention firm GEO Group" [4]. A judge has accused the Trump administration of "manufacturing chaos in migrant deportation case" [5].

## 4. Legal and Constitutional Issues

The Supreme Court is entering a decisive phase as it is "poised to decide cases on birthright citizenship, transgender care and religion" [1]. It recently declined to hear the Oak Flat case, which would have paved the way for a large-scale copper mine on sacred Native American land [2], and rejected a case about a student's "There are only two genders" T-shirt [3].

The Atlantic reports the executive branch may be circumventing court orders while maintaining the appearance of compliance [4]. The Guardian suggests the Republican budget bill contains a "hidden measure" that would dramatically increase presidential power [5]. A letter warns that a provision in the House budget bill could block courts from enforcing contempt rulings [6].

## 5. Domestic Policy and Economic Issues

### 5.1 Social Programs

A high-stakes battle is underway in Congress over the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared "Hands off SNAP" on the House floor [1], while Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro criticized Republicans for "ripping away Medicaid and SNAP from Pennsylvanians" [2]. There are concerns that more than 3 million people could lose SNAP benefits under a GOP bill [3].

Work requirements are reportedly "better at blocking benefits for low-income people than they are at helping those folks find jobs" [4]. Multiple outlets suggest the Trump administration plans significant changes to Medicaid, with advisers acknowledging cuts [5]. A program helping 6 million families pay energy bills may also be at risk [6].

### 5.2 Economic Developments

Trump's media company is making a significant cryptocurrency investment, with The Verge reporting plans to "buy $2.5 billion in Bitcoin" [1]. President Trump has stated that the U.S. "will control US Steel as part of Nippon deal" [2]. A study indicates the U.S. could lose $23 billion in GDP and 230,000 jobs if foreign tourists stay away due to tariffs [3]. NPR reports that "Corporate America's retreat from DEI has eliminated thousands of jobs" [4].

## 6. Political Strategies and Electoral Outlook

Politicians are gearing up for the 2026 election cycle. Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville has announced his bid for Alabama governor in 2026 [1]. The Washington Post suggests "A 'Blue Wave' is building" though "It won't look the same as the last one" [2]. Democrats are discussing how to "win back working class and gain young male support" [3].

The Democratic Party appears to be reassessing strategy, with reports the party is "scrambling to fix image" as members acknowledge it has "lost credibility" [4]. Representative Jasmine Crockett has stated Democrats "Will Investigate Trump if They Reclaim the House in the Midterms" [5].
