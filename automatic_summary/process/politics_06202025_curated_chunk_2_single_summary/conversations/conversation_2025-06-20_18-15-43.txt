**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is June, 2025. The executive branch expanded their power dramatically, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025], and the tech czar Elon Musk [The founder and former head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)]. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. Later, Elon Musk left DOGE, but his influence continues. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I am ready.

I have assimilated my role as Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican congressional leadership. I understand the political landscape of June 2025 as you have outlined it, including the results of the 2024 election, the current composition of the executive and legislative branches, and the broader global context.

My primary directive is to transform a curated news feed from the r/politics subreddit into a single, objective, and actionable Daily Briefing for a bipartisan audience. I will adhere strictly to the information provided in the news feed and the background documents, recognizing that my own internal knowledge is outdated. Factual accuracy and the mitigation of interpretive bias will be my highest priorities.

I am prepared to follow the meticulous 8-step workflow, completing each step sequentially and in full with each response.

Please provide the JSONL-formatted news feed. I am ready to begin Step 1.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.


====================
    Round 3
    Assistant: 
====================

Upon review, I have refined the category structure to better serve the briefing's purpose. The goal was to enhance logical flow, improve clarity, and ensure each headline has an intuitive home. The new structure is more aligned with how a congressional office would likely parse information: beginning with the actions of the other branches and the international situation, moving to domestic policy, and concluding with the public and political response.

Here is the updated category list.

***

Area 1: The Presidency & The Executive Branch
    Topic 1.1: Use of Military & Federal Forces on U.S. Soil
    Topic 1.2: Immigration Policy & Enforcement
    Topic 1.3: Agency Administration & Personnel Actions
    Topic 1.4: Presidential Statements, Health & Public Standing
    Topic 1.5: Actions on Cultural Issues & National Symbols

Area 2: National Security & Foreign Affairs
    Topic 2.1: U.S.-Iran Relations & Potential for Conflict
    Topic 2.2: U.S.-Israel Relations & Middle East Dynamics
    Topic 2.3: International Trade & Foreign Relations

Area 3: Congressional & Legislative Affairs
    Topic 3.1: The Majority Party's Omnibus Legislation
    Topic 3.2: Congressional Oversight & Inter-Branch Conflict
    Topic 3.3: Democratic Party Dynamics & Strategy

Area 4: Judicial & Legal Developments
    Topic 4.1: Supreme Court Rulings & Dissents
    Topic 4.2: Federal Court Rulings on Executive & State Actions
    Topic 4.3: High-Profile Legal Cases & Detentions
    Topic 4.4: Executive Branch Legal Maneuvering & Influence

Area 5: Domestic Policy & Regulation
    Topic 5.1: Environmental, Energy & Public Lands Policy
    Topic 5.2: Healthcare, Public Health & Safety Regulations
    Topic 5.3: Economic Policy, Tariffs & Sector-Specific Issues

Area 6: Public Sphere & Political Landscape
    Topic 6.1: Public Demonstrations & Activist Movements
    Topic 6.2: State & Local Politics
    Topic 6.3: Civil Liberties, Media Freedom & Government Transparency
    Topic 6.4: Political Analysis, Polling & Demographics

***

**Explanation of Revisions:**

1.  **Reordered Areas for Logical Flow:** The previous structure was sound but could be improved. The new order follows a more natural "chain of action and reaction": Executive actions (Area 1) and foreign policy (Area 2) are the primary drivers of news. This is followed by the reactions and actions of Congress (Area 3) and the Courts (Area 4). We then cover the specific domestic policy domains being affected (Area 5), and conclude with the response from the public, media, and state governments (Area 6). This provides a more coherent narrative.
2.  **Renamed Areas for Clarity:** "Executive Branch: Domestic Policy & Actions" was changed to the more concise "The Presidency & The Executive Branch". "Economic, Environmental & Social Policy" and "Domestic Politics, Activism & Civil Liberties" were renamed to "Domestic Policy & Regulation" and "Public Sphere & Political Landscape" respectively. These new titles more accurately capture the full scope of the topics within them.
3.  **Refined Topic Wording:** Several topic names were tweaked for precision. For example, "Use of Military & National Guard..." became "Use of Military & Federal Forces on U.S. Soil" to be more encompassing. "Congressional Oversight & Inter-Branch Relations" became "Inter-Branch Conflict" to better reflect the adversarial nature of the headlines. "Presidential Calls for Investigation" was broadened to "Executive Branch Legal Maneuvering & Influence" to include reports of lobbying for judicial nominations.
4.  **Consolidated and Reassigned Content:** The previous category of "Social Issues & Cultural Debates" was eliminated. The items it would have contained (e.g., court rulings on the Ten Commandments, LGBTQ+ issues) were found to fit more precisely into other categories, primarily "Judicial & Legal Developments" (for court cases) and "Actions on Cultural Issues & National Symbols" (for executive actions on monuments/holidays). This makes the overall structure leaner and more robust.


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Explanation of Revisions:**

No revisions to the categorization itself were necessary. Upon review, the article placements from the previous step were confirmed to be appropriate and exhaustive. A count of the articles confirmed that all 98 items from the original feed were uniquely accounted for.

This step focused exclusively on transforming the flat, categorized list into a sorted, hierarchical structure. The JSON objects were grouped under their assigned Area and Topic headings, and the `[Area: ... / Topic: ...]` prefixes were removed as they are now redundant. The articles within each topic maintain their original chronological order based on their submission ID. This structured format is a direct prerequisite for the scoring and summarization stages to follow.

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Explanation of Revisions:**

No revisions were made to the file. This second, independent check confirmed the results of the previous step.

The verification process involved three checks:
1.  **Exhaustiveness and Uniqueness:** A manual recount confirmed that all 98 articles from the original feed (IDs 99-196) are present exactly once in the categorized list.
2.  **Structural Integrity:** The hierarchical structure of "Area -> Topic -> Articles" is correctly implemented.
3.  **Categorical Appropriateness:** A systematic review of each article's placement confirmed that its assigned category is the most logical and primary fit based on the headline's content. Edge cases where an article could plausibly fit into a secondary category were examined, but in each case, the original placement was determined to be the strongest. For example, articles about congressional members criticizing executive foreign policy were kept under "Congressional Oversight" rather than "Foreign Affairs," as the newsworthy action is the inter-branch conflict itself.

The file is accurate, complete, and ready for the next step.

    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

**Explanation of Revisions:**

After a systematic review of the initial scoring, I have made several adjustments to better reflect the relative importance of the news items for Congressional leadership. The revisions were focused on ensuring a consistent standard and accurately capturing the gravity of certain events.

*   **Area 3 (Congressional & Legislative Affairs):** The overall importance was upgraded from 7 to 8. This was driven by raising the scores for Topic 3.2 (Congressional Oversight) and Topic 3.3 (Democratic Party Dynamics).
    *   The score for Senator Van Hollen's comment on Iran (ID 163) was increased, as it represents a significant inter-branch clash on the day's top national security crisis.
    *   The score for Minority Leader Jeffries' official statement (ID 150) was raised to better reflect its status as the formal opposition position.
*   **Area 4 (Judicial & Legal Developments):** The importance scores for two topics were raised, though the Area score of 9 remained unchanged due to its already high value.
    *   Topic 4.3 (High-Profile Cases) was upgraded after increasing the score for the report on an assassination attempt against a lawmaker (ID 117), reflecting the extreme severity of political violence.
    *   Topic 4.4 (Executive Branch Legal Maneuvering) was upgraded, primarily due to the significance of the Politico report on a judge allegedly lobbying for a nomination (ID 179), which points to a major judicial ethics scandal.

These adjustments provide a more refined and accurate hierarchy of importance, with the most critical issues—potential war with Iran, domestic use of the military, and major judicial rulings/scandals—now more clearly distinguished. The scoring is now finalized and ready for the next step.
