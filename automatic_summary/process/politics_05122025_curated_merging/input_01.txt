# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Trade & Economic Policy

### 1.1 US-China Trade Relations
The United States and China have reached a trade agreement following discussions in Geneva [1]. While the White House characterizes this as a "deal," Chinese officials have more cautiously labeled it a "consensus" [2]. This 90-day agreement includes significant tariff reductions [3] and a drastic rollback in tariffs in what CNN describes as a "major trade breakthrough" [4]. Some critics frame the deal as "Trump's Capitulation Day" [5], while Commerce Secretary Lutnick has attempted to mitigate fallout from "Trump's Brutal Tariff Comments" [6]. Financial markets have responded positively, with CNBC reporting that markets are "soaring" [7].
