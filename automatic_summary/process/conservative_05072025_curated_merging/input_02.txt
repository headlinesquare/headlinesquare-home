In a dramatic territorial initiative, U.S. intelligence agencies have been directed to gather information on Greenland [1] as the administration actively considers potential acquisition. Ahead of scheduled nuclear talks with Iran and a planned Middle East trip, President Trump intends to officially rename the Persian Gulf as the "Arabian Gulf" [2].
