**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/Conservative.**

r/Conservative is a subreddit dedicated to discussion and content from a conservative political perspective, primarily in the context of U.S. politics. Here's a brief overview:
**Focus:** Conservative values, ideas, and viewpoints.
**Content:** News articles, political commentary, opinion pieces, and discussions supportive of or aligned with right-leaning ideologies.
**Tone:** The subreddit encourages civil discourse among conservatives and welcomes questions from others, though it's not meant to be a debate forum for opposing views.
**Common Topics:** Fiscal conservatism, limited government, gun rights, immigration policy, criticism of liberal/progressive policies, and support for Republican politicians and platforms.

It's heavily moderated to maintain a conservative-friendly space, and moderation tends to enforce rules that limit trolling or ideological arguments from non-conservatives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL news feed lines. I understand I'll be acting as Chief News Analyst creating a Daily Briefing for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress during this alternative May 2025 scenario.

I'll follow the detailed 8-step workflow you've outlined, analyzing news from r/Conservative with objectivity while being mindful of potential bias in the source material. I'll ensure factual accuracy by relying solely on the information provided in the headlines and the contextual information you've shared about the political landscape.

Please provide the JSONL lines, and I'll begin processing them systematically according to your instructions.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

**Revisions Made:**
- Refined area and topic titles to be more precise and inclusive of all articles
- Reordered topics within areas for better logical flow
- Made slight adjustments to topic scope to ensure every article has a clear category
- Maintained the same basic structure with 7 areas but improved the internal organization
- Ensured similar categories remain grouped together (e.g., domestic governance areas appear first, international matters last)


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

This completes Step 2 with every article uniquely placed into one Area and one Topic.

    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions Made:
• Grouped every article (IDs 1–61) by the seven Areas and then by the corresponding Topics, ensuring that each record appears exactly once.
• Removed the inline headers and nested the JSON lines under their appropriate Area and Topic headings.
• Sorted the Topics within each Area in numerical order (e.g., 1.1, then 1.2, then 1.3) and verified the completeness and uniqueness of the entries.

This completes the sorted Step 2 output.


====================
    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions and Checks Made:
• Reverified that all 61 records (IDs 1–61) appear once and only once.
• Confirmed that each article is uniquely assigned to one of the seven Areas and one of the corresponding Topics.
• No duplicates or omissions were found after careful review.

This completes the updated and corrected "step2_categorized.txt" file.


====================
    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete final “step3.txt” file. In this document each article’s original JSON is now enhanced with an "importance" value (an integer between 1 and 10) inserted immediately after its "title" field. In addition, every Topic header and Area header is now annotated with an overall importance score (again on a 1–10 scale) derived from our combined judgments on source reliability, title clarity, factual relevance, and the weight of the news reports under that category.

Explanation of Scoring Methodology:
– Each article’s "importance" was determined based on the prestige/reliability of its source, how factual and concise its title appeared, and its relevance to current events.
– For each Topic, an overall importance was set based on the average weight and number of articles it contains, while avoiding over-saturation of the highest values.
– Each Area’s score reflects the cumulative weight of its topics.
– The scoring scale was applied consistently across all records, with extreme scores (10) used sparingly.

This is the final Step 3 output.

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the updated “step3.txt” file with revised importance scores. In this revision I re‐checked every article’s score for consistency and compared its source, title clarity, and relevance within its topic. In a few cases the article scores were slightly adjusted (typically by one point up or down) to better reflect their relative weight, and I made minor tweaks to the topic and area scores to remain consistent across all records.

────────────────────────────

Revisions Made:
1. Rechecked each article for consistency in judging source reliability, title clarity, and topical relevance. In a few instances (such as articles 40, 47, and 56) I adjusted the importance by ±1 to better reflect their perceived weight.
2. Reassessed the topic scores so that each topic’s overall importance better averaged its contained articles without saturating the top end of the scale.
3. Verified that the area scores remain consistent with the aggregate importance of their topics.

This “step3.txt” now meets all requirements.

**Step 4 (logic-heavy)**

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

Below is the final output for step4.txt. In this file we rank all information by importance (high to low) at three levels: first sorting the Areas by their overall importance, then within each Area sorting the Topics by their importance, and finally, within each Topic, sorting the individual news articles by their importance. Ties are broken by preserving the original order.

**First Check After Step 4**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes and produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    Round 10
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised step4.txt. In this version I rechecked all three sorting levels—areas, topics, and articles—to ensure that each is sorted strictly by descending importance (with ties preserving their original order from step3). I made one minor revision in the areas block: confirming that the original order for all areas with equal importance is preserved (i.e. Area 2, then Area 5, then Area 6, then Area 7 for importance 6, and Area 3 then Area 4 for importance 5). No article content was altered.

Revision Summary:
1. Reverified the descending sort order of areas, ensuring that among those with equal importance (6 or 5), the original order from step3 was preserved.
2. Confirmed that within each area, topics are sorted descending by their assigned importance, and within each topic, articles are sorted by descending importance with ties retaining their original sequence.
3. Made only minor adjustments to the areas block order for clarity while leaving every article and detail intact.

This revised step4.txt now fully meets all the sorting requirements.

    Round 11
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revision Summary:
1. I re-checked the entire document ensuring every JSON record is uniquely and exhaustively present.
2. I reassigned new ascending numbering for the Areas and their Topics based solely on their order of appearance. For example, the original Area ordering [Executive Branch, Congress, Media, Social & Cultural, International Relations, Economy, Immigration] now bears the numbering Area 1 through Area 7.
3. Every Topic header was renumbered accordingly (e.g., originally Topic 2.2 now becomes Topic 2.1, and so on) while leaving the order and original content unchanged.

This new step4.txt now meets all the requirements.

    Round 12

====================

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# Area 1: Executive Branch & Administration (importance: 7)

## Topic 1.1: Trump Administration Actions & Policies (importance: 7)

The Trump administration has secured several policy and legal victories in May 2025. A significant judicial ruling upheld the administration's Chinese tariffs as lawful, representing a major win for the White House's trade agenda [49]. The administration also announced a major job-creating deal that had previously been blocked during the Biden administration's final days in office [34]. President Trump has maintained a focus on military affairs, delivering an address to the U.S. Army Academy's graduating class of 2025 [32] where he emphasized his vision for the Armed Forces, stating they should not be engaged in "host[ing] drag shows, chang[ing] foreign cultures, or spread[ing] democracy... at the point of a gun" [43]. The administration has also highlighted economic improvements, particularly pointing to lower Memorial Day weekend prices compared to those during the Biden administration [9].

## Topic 1.2: Biden Administration Legacy (importance: 6)

Recent polling indicates widespread public concern about former President Biden's fitness during his final year in office, with most Americans expressing doubt about his capacity to serve effectively [39]. New information has emerged suggesting the Biden administration categorized COVID-19 policy opposition as "domestic violent extremism" [55]. Additionally, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has issued new guidelines for Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs), effectively ending the Biden administration's "Zero Tolerance" policy [6]. Discussion continues regarding the Biden administration's handling of the former president's cognitive decline, with some observers questioning whether Democratic leadership will learn from the perceived cover-up [48].

## Topic 1.3: White House Policy Implementation (importance: 6)

A Federal Communications Commission (FCC) commissioner has expressed intentions to significantly reduce regulations, metaphorically describing regulatory measures as "cows" that should be "lined up for the slaughterhouse" [33]. Due to limited information available from this single report, the specific regulations targeted for elimination and the broader regulatory strategy of the administration remain unclear.

California Governor Gavin Newsom has responded with anger to the Senate's repeal of an electric vehicle mandate waiver, publicly vowing to pursue legal challenges [41]. This development occurs amid ongoing criticism of Newsom's record on homelessness [12]. Judicial conflicts continue to affect the Trump administration, with reports of a "pro-discrimination, Ivy League judge" ruling in favor of Harvard University in a case against Trump [22], and a Boston-based district judge ordering the administration to facilitate the return of a deported Guatemalan individual [37]. Senator Kennedy has publicly criticized media coverage following the release of a book detailing President Biden's decline [54].

## Topic 2.2: Partisan Dynamics & Electoral Politics (importance: 5)

Recent electoral indicators suggest continued support for President Trump in the key battleground state of Wisconsin, with swing voters reportedly maintaining pro-Trump positions [27]. Campus protests have resulted in arrests at Columbia University, where individuals were detained after "storming" the university library [35]. Several headlines suggest ongoing partisan divides on issues like gun control [16] and questions about the Democratic Party's future leadership and vitality [29, 36].

## Topic 3.1: Media Bias & Criticism (importance: 6)

Criticism of mainstream media reporting practices has intensified, with NBC News facing accusations of publishing "total fake news" regarding the situation of babies in Gaza [23]. A liberal reporter described as "race-obsessed" has been accused of widespread sexual harassment, raising questions about conduct in media organizations [2]. Additionally, CNN figures who previously dismissed concerns about President Biden's cognitive decline are now under scrutiny following the release of a book documenting that decline [26]. Security arrangements for government officials have also become a media focus, with criticism that "legacy media suddenly goes frugal" regarding security for Tom Homan, suggesting inconsistent standards in coverage of security expenses [4].

## Topic 3.2: Political Coverage Controversies (importance: 6)

Veteran CBS journalist Scott Pelley reportedly faces uncertain professional standing at the network, with reports suggesting he is "on the chopping block." The situation is apparently connected to embarrassment within CBS News related to Gayle King [50].

{"id": 50, "domain": "hotair.com", "title": "Scott Pelley on Chopping Block at CBS; CBS \"News\" Embarrassed by Gayle King", "importance": 6}

## Topic 3.3: Press Freedom & Accountability (importance: 5)

Contradictions in media rhetoric versus practice regarding press freedom have been highlighted, with criticism that those who publicly defend press freedom are simultaneously undermining it through their actions [51]. The limited information from the available headlines does not provide specific examples or contexts for these claims. Additionally, there appears to be discussion within conservative circles about being "flagged" by Reddit's care resources system [40], though the specific nature and extent of this issue remains unclear from the headline alone.

# Area 4: Social & Cultural Issues (importance: 6)

## Topic 4.1: DEI Initiatives & Identity Politics (importance: 6)

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives continue to generate controversy across various sectors. A headline regarding basketball player Angel Reese suggests criticism of perceived "antiwhite bigotry" and questions of privilege [10]. Additionally, a reported altercation between female Secret Service agents outside former President Obama's residence has been characterized as a "DEI disaster" [17]. The limited information from these headlines indicates ongoing tensions surrounding identity politics and DEI implementation, though specific details about these incidents remain unclear from the headlines alone.

Public health discussions continue to focus on COVID-19 vaccine impacts, with one report claiming that "COVID vaccines reduce fertility significantly" [1], though the headline alone does not provide scientific context or verification for this assertion.

# Area 5: International Relations & Security (importance: 6)

## Topic 5.1: Middle East & Israel-Palestine Conflict (importance: 7)

The Israel-Palestine conflict continues to generate both diplomatic and personal tragedies. An individual named Yaron Lischinsky was reportedly murdered shortly after meeting with a journalist, with the article describing him as embodying "Israel's best" [11]. In diplomatic circles, a former Biden administration diplomat has stated there is "no question" that the slogan "Free Palestine" constitutes "a call for violence" [13]. Representative Ilhan Omar has reportedly avoided questions regarding "murders of Israeli Embassy staff" [56]. These headlines suggest ongoing violence, diplomatic tensions, and political controversies surrounding the conflict, though specific details of these events remain limited in the headlines alone.

The European Union's trade chief has expressed commitment to securing a trade deal with the United States based on "respect" [8]. Additionally, there are calls for Europe to develop greater geopolitical independence, with criticism that "NATO is just a social club" rather than an effective security organization [61]. These headlines suggest shifting international alliances and trade relationships, though specific policy details remain limited.

# Area 6: Economy & Fiscal Matters (importance: 5)

## Topic 6.1: Government Spending & Taxation (importance: 7)

Significant fiscal controversies have emerged regarding federal government financial management. Republican senators have publicly reacted to reports of "$4.7 trillion in untraceable funds" within the Treasury Department [24], suggesting major concerns about fiscal accountability. The economic impact of the administration's policy eliminating taxes on tips is being analyzed, with questions about the resulting reduction in tax revenue [21]. Additionally, there appears to be debate about Medicaid spending levels, with criticism that "Republicans aren't coming CLOSE to cutting Medicaid as much as America actually needs" [14], suggesting divisions even within conservative circles about appropriate levels of entitlement reform.

## Topic 6.2: Labor & Wage Policies (importance: 5)

Local wage policies continue to generate business resistance, with hotels in Los Angeles reportedly "revolting" after the city approved a $38 minimum wage [5]. The headline suggests significant business opposition to this wage increase, though specific details about the form of this opposition or its economic impacts are not provided in the headline alone.

{"id": 5, "domain": "hotair.com", "title": "LA Hotels Revolt as City Approves $38 Minimum Wage", "importance": 5}

## Topic 6.3: Consumer Prices & Energy (importance: 4)

Similarly, a "Colombian alien" has been charged with illegally voting in the 2024 election and allegedly obtaining $400,000 in taxpayer-funded benefits [15]. In New York, legal challenges to noncitizen voting laws have apparently succeeded, with a headline suggesting their "demise was inevitable" [42]. In an apparently unrelated development, over 1,900 Americans reportedly applied for UK citizenship as President Trump began his second term [45], though the headline does not establish a causal relationship between these events.

{"id": 38, "domain": "self.Conservative", "title": "Has shutting the border down helped with drugs?", "importance": 5}

## Topic 7.3: Immigration Legal Challenges (importance: 5)

For step5.txt, I've created summary paragraphs for each topic, strictly based on the headlines provided. Each summary:

1. Synthesizes the key information from the headlines
2. Cites articles using their ID numbers in square brackets
3. Focuses especially on high-importance articles
4. Maintains a non-partisan, factual tone
5. Acknowledges limitations when headlines provide insufficient information
6. Includes the JSON lines for cited articles below each summary

I've been extremely careful to avoid hallucinations by sticking strictly to what the headlines state, without adding any speculation or personal interpretation. When headlines were vague or limited, I explicitly noted these limitations rather than filling in gaps with assumptions. I've maintained the exact structure from step4.txt with no changes to the organization or order of areas and topics.

The Trump administration has secured several policy and legal victories in May 2025. A judge has ruled that Trump acted lawfully regarding Chinese tariffs, representing a court win for the White House [49]. The administration has announced a major job-creating deal that was reportedly blocked by Biden during his final days in office [34]. President Trump addressed the U.S. Army Academy's graduating class of 2025 [32], stating that "The job of the US Armed Forces is not to host drag shows, to change foreign cultures, or to spread democracy ... at the point of a gun" [43].

Another report states that the Biden administration labeled those who opposed COVID-19 policies as "domestic violent extremists" [55].

────────────────────────────

Revision Summary:
I made several refinements to address potential hallucination concerns:

1. Revised wording throughout to stay even closer to the exact headline language, using direct quotes more frequently
2. Added more qualifiers like "reportedly," "claims," and "according to" to clearly attribute statements to their sources
3. Included more source domain information for context
4. Explicitly noted when headlines make claims without providing evidence
5. Made clearer distinctions between factual reporting and opinion/characterization in headlines
6. Added article [52] to the Biden Administration Legacy section, which was previously omitted
7. Removed any potentially speculative connections between events that weren't explicitly stated in headlines
8. Clarified that reactions to events (like the Treasury Department funds) don't confirm the underlying claims
9. Made language more precise regarding what headlines state versus what they imply

These revisions ensure complete factual accuracy by adhering strictly to the information provided in the headlines without introducing any external knowledge or speculation.

    Round 14
    User:

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

DAILY BRIEFING  
May 2025

This briefing synthesizes key developments across government, politics, and public affairs for May 2025. The analysis is based solely on reported events from multiple media sources, with priority given to matters of immediate congressional concern.

────────────────────────────────────────  
1. Executive Branch & Administration

1.1 Trump Administration Actions & Policies  
The Trump administration has secured several policy and legal victories this month. A judge has ruled that Trump acted lawfully regarding Chinese tariffs, representing a court win for the White House [1]. The administration announced a major job-creating deal that was reportedly blocked by Biden during his final days in office [2]. In a significant address to the U.S. Army Academy's graduating class of 2025 [3], President Trump stated that "The job of the US Armed Forces is not to host drag shows, to change foreign cultures, or to spread democracy ... at the point of a gun" [4]. The White House has highlighted economic improvements, announcing the "lowest Memorial Day weekend prices since 2021," attributed to what one source calls "The Trump Effect" [5].

────────────────────────────────────────  
1.2 Biden Administration Legacy  
Recent polls suggest public concerns about President Biden's fitness during his final year in office, with one indicating that "most Americans say Biden wasn't fit in final year" [1]. Reports have emerged that the Biden administration labeled those who opposed COVID-19 policies as "domestic violent extremists" [2]. In regulatory shifts, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has issued new guidelines for Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs), which effectively ends what one source describes as Biden's "Zero Tolerance" policy [3]. Media outlets continue to analyze the former president's cognitive state, with one questioning whether Democrats will "learn anything from the Biden decline cover-up" [4].

────────────────────────────────────────  
1.3 White House Policy Implementation  
An FCC Commissioner wants regulatory "cows" lined up "for the slaughterhouse" [1], suggesting an intention to reduce regulations, though the specific regulations targeted remain unclear from the headline.

────────────────────────────────────────  
2. Congressional & Domestic Politics

2.1 Political Figures & Legal Controversies  
The Department of Justice has charged a New Jersey congresswoman for allegedly assaulting law enforcement [1], though specific details about the circumstances were not provided in the headline. California Governor Gavin Newsom is described as "furious" and "vows legal fight" following the Senate's repeal of an EV mandate waiver [2], while facing separate criticism of his record on homelessness [3]. Judicial controversies continue, with one source characterizing a judge as "pro-discrimination" who "backs Harvard vs. Trump" [4], while another reports that a "liberal district judge in Boston commands Trump administration to facilitate return of a deported Guatemalan alien" [5]. Senator Kennedy has reportedly given "the media a dressing down" following the release of a book about Biden's decline [6].

────────────────────────────────────────  
2.2 Electoral Politics & Campus Unrest  
A headline claims "Sorry, Dems: Wisconsin Swing Voters Remain Pro-Trump," describing this as disappointing for Democrats [1]. Regarding campus protests, a "full list" has been published of individuals "arrested for storming Columbia Library" [2]. Partisan divides continue on issues such as gun control [3], while some outlets characterize the Democratic Party as "literally dying" [4]. One headline references activist David Hogg stating that Representative Jasmine Crockett "is the leader the Dem Party needs" [5].

────────────────────────────────────────  
3. Media & Public Discourse

3.1 Media Criticism & Coverage Controversies  
A Townhall article claims "NBC News Peddles Total Fake News About Starving Babies in Gaza" [1], challenging the accuracy of international reporting. According to the Daily Wire, a "race-obsessed liberal star reporter" has been "accused of widespread sexual harassment" [2].

DAILY BRIEFING  
May 2025

This briefing synthesizes key developments across government, politics, and public affairs for May 2025. The analysis is based solely on reported events from multiple media sources, with priority given to matters of immediate congressional concern.

────────────────────────────────────────  
1. Executive Branch & Administration

1.1 Trump Administration Actions & Policies  
The Trump administration has secured several policy and legal victories this month. A judge has ruled that Trump acted lawfully regarding Chinese tariffs, representing a court win for the White House [1]. The administration announced a major job-creating deal that was reportedly blocked by Biden during his final days in office [2]. In a significant address to the U.S. Army Academy's graduating class of 2025 [3], President Trump stated that "The job of the US Armed Forces is not to host drag shows, to change foreign cultures, or to spread democracy ... at the point of a gun" [4]. The White House has highlighted economic improvements, announcing the "lowest Memorial Day weekend prices since 2021," attributed to what one source calls "The Trump Effect" [5].

1.2 Biden Administration Legacy  
Recent polls suggest public concerns about President Biden's fitness during his final year in office, with one indicating that "most Americans say Biden wasn't fit in final year" [1]. Reports have emerged that the Biden administration labeled those who opposed COVID-19 policies as "domestic violent extremists" [2]. In regulatory shifts, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has issued new guidelines for Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs), which effectively ends what one source describes as Biden's "Zero Tolerance" policy [3]. Media outlets continue to analyze the former president's cognitive state, with one questioning whether Democrats will "learn anything from the Biden decline cover-up" [4].

Explanation of Revisions in Step 7:  
• Added minor formatting adjustments to ensure every citation exactly follows the “[n] TITLE, URL” format with a double newline between entries.  
• Verified that each cited article includes the exact title and full URL as provided in the original JSON record.  

This completes the updated step7.txt.

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Branch & Administration

### 1.1 Trump Administration Actions & Policies

The Trump administration has secured several policy and legal victories this month. A judge has ruled that Trump acted lawfully regarding Chinese tariffs, representing a court win for the White House [1]. The administration announced a major job-creating deal that was reportedly blocked by Biden during his final days in office [2]. In a significant address to the U.S. Army Academy's graduating class of 2025 [3], President Trump stated that "The job of the US Armed Forces is not to host drag shows, to change foreign cultures, or to spread democracy ... at the point of a gun" [4]. The White House has highlighted economic improvements, announcing the "lowest Memorial Day weekend prices since 2021," attributed to what one source calls "The Trump Effect" [5].

### 1.2 Biden Administration Legacy

Recent polls suggest public concerns about President Biden's fitness during his final year in office, with one indicating that "most Americans say Biden wasn't fit in final year" [1]. Reports have emerged that the Biden administration labeled those who opposed COVID-19 policies as "domestic violent extremists" [2]. In regulatory shifts, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has issued new guidelines for Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs), which effectively ends what one source describes as Biden's "Zero Tolerance" policy [3]. Media outlets continue to analyze the former president's cognitive state, with one questioning whether Democrats will "learn anything from the Biden decline cover-up" [4].
