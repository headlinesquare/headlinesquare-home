**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch expanded their power dramatically, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025], and the tech czar Elon Musk [The founder and former head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)]. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. Now, Elon Musk is leaving his role as the head of DOGE, but his influence continues.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

---

Because there are several hundreds of news articles posted in some subreddit communities every day, it is hard to summarize all of them in a single process. Fortunately, I have already broken the articles in that day into chunks by submission time in the 24 hour coverage window in ascending order, and generated summaries for each chunk with LLMs. Those detailed summary chunks will be posted here. Each has a length of 1300-1700 words without counting the URLs, and citing 30-50 news articles. 

The chunks are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, there are 4 chunks, and the news coverage cycle is from yesterday's 18:00 to today's 18:00. Chunk 1 is from the articles submitted between 18:00 of yesterday to 06:00 of today, Chunk 2 is for 06:00 to 10:00 today, Chunk 3 is for 10:00 to 14:00 today, and Chunk 4 is from 14:00 to 18:00 today. The first chunk is based on the earliest articles submitted to the subreddit community. The last chunk is based on the latest articles submitted. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in Chunk 2 **happen** after all the news stories in Chunk 1, just because they are **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from Chunk 1 and B from Chunk 2, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This rule applies to all chunks in sequential order. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from different chunks. 

**Your task is to critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks, and then faithfully merge all of them into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks.** 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

---

Please tell me if you are ready to receive the individual summaries. I will provide them all at once. And please follow my later instructions, be patient, do the work step by step.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I am ready to receive the individual summaries of the Reddit news feed. Once you provide them, I will carefully analyze their content, identify important themes and developments, and merge them into a comprehensive Daily Briefing that can inform both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.

I understand that factual accuracy is paramount, and I will rely solely on the information provided in the summaries rather than my internal knowledge. When news items lack sufficient context, I'll present them without speculation and quote headlines directly as needed. For political figures, I'll refer to the lists you've provided for current positions and titles.

Please provide all the summary chunks, and I'll work through them methodically to create an objective, balanced, and informative briefing.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1**

Comparing:

Please critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks provided below. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You must use your limited length to summarize the most important news, while skipping the secondary.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.

Please carefully think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. **You will do the merging task in the next round with my detailed instructions. Please do not attempt to write down your summary at this step, because you haven't been given the full instructions yet!** It is always better to take some time to think clearly for such a difficult task, and make detailed plans for yourself, before taking any actions. You should use this opportunity to prepare yourself for your next round of work by writing down some notes for yourself.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Federal-State Power Dynamics

### 1.1 Legal Challenges to Federal Actions

California is mounting significant legal opposition to President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles. Governor Gavin Newsom has declared the deployment "unlawful" [1] and announced the state will file a lawsuit against the Trump administration [2][3]. This represents a direct legal confrontation between state and federal authorities over the deployment of military personnel for domestic operations. The conflict has escalated to public challenges, with Newsom explicitly daring federal officials to arrest him over his opposition to the federal actions.

### 1.2 State Rights and Sovereignty Challenges

Multiple state sovereignty disputes have emerged between states and the federal government. Governor Newsom has characterized the National Guard deployment in Los Angeles as a "breach of state sovereignty" [1]. In an economic dimension to the federal-state tensions, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has accused Newsom of threatening "tax evasion" [2]. Separately but related to state and territorial rights, disputes over voting and citizenship in U.S. territories have emerged, with their colonial history becoming a factor in these discussions [3].

## 2. International Relations

### 2.1 Russia-Ukraine Policy

President Trump has implemented a new approach to Russia's war in Ukraine that is generating criticism, with MSNBC characterizing it as potentially "his worst yet" [1]. There appears to be division among Republican lawmakers on Russia policy, with Senator Rand Paul openly criticizing Senator Lindsey Graham's advocacy for Russian sanctions, describing them as "self-defeating economic warfare" [2]. These disagreements suggest tensions within the Republican Party over the appropriate U.S. stance toward Russia and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

## 3. Immigration Enforcement Crisis

### 3.1 ICE Operations and Deportation Policies

The Trump administration has implemented immigration enforcement policies, including a new travel ban that has taken effect amid escalating tensions [1]. These policies may impact U.S. families who depend on immigrant childcare workers [2]. The enforcement actions have generated controversy even among some Trump supporters, with the co-founder of Latinas for Trump condemning what she termed "inhumane" immigrant arrests [3]. A major focus of enforcement actions appears to be in Los Angeles, where an immigration crackdown is underway [4].

### 3.2 Los Angeles Protests and Civil Unrest

Los Angeles has seen protests following President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops and immigration enforcement actions. Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets, blocking freeways [1] and challenging federal authorities with chants like "We're not afraid of you" [2]. The Mexican Flag has become a potent protest symbol [3]. As protests intensify [4], confrontations have occurred, with protesters confronting federal agents and setting fires in downtown L.A. [5].

Multiple journalists have been injured by rubber bullets, including a British photographer [6] and reporters who were shot while on camera [7]. There are reports of a protester being stomped by mounted police [8] and incidents of mass looting [9]. NPR has published a guide to understanding the immigration raid protests that occurred over the weekend [10].

### 3.3 National Guard and Military Deployment

President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles has led to confrontations with protesters shortly after their arrival [1]. California's governor has characterized the deployment as "the acts of a dictator" [2], while The New York Times has described it as "the real emergency" [3]. Trump has indicated that invoking the Insurrection Act remains a possibility for addressing the LA protests [4]. 

Republican leaders appear divided on military response, with House Speaker Mike Johnson defending a potential Marines deployment as not "heavy-handed" [5], while Senator Ron Johnson expressed his belief that deploying Marines "won't be necessary" [6].

A direct confrontation has emerged between federal officials and California state leadership over immigration enforcement. A Trump administration border official has threatened to arrest those who interfere with immigration operations, specifically warning California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass not to "cross that line" [1]. Governor Newsom has responded to these threats, directly challenging someone referred to as "Tom" in the headline with statements like "arrest me. Let's go" [2] and appearing "unfazed" by the possibility of arrest [3][4]. This exchange represents significant tension between federal immigration authorities and state leadership.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Trump Administration Governance

### 1.1 Executive Leadership Changes (Trump-Musk Relationship)

A significant rift has emerged between President Trump and Elon Musk, who recently departed as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) [1]. The deterioration of this once–prominent alliance has created identifiable "winners and losers" within the administration and Republican party structure [1]. The public disagreement has reportedly exposed what some sources characterize as "hypocrisy" within GOP ranks [2], suggesting the feud has broader implications for party unity and policy direction. In addition, recent coverage indicates that prominent figures such as Bill Gates are reacting to the fallout [3] and experts are weighing in on what the break-up means for America's space ambitions [4].

### 1.2 Executive Orders and Policy Implementation

The Trump administration has taken dramatic executive actions that critics characterize as authoritarian. Military equipment—specifically tanks—is reportedly being deployed to Washington D.C., accompanied by presidential directives to "bring in the troops" [1]. This militarization of the federal response has raised concerns about potential government repression. Simultaneously, the administration is pursuing what some describe as a "war on the administrative state" with alleged class implications [2]. Moreover, indicators suggest that Trump might invoke the Insurrection Act to justify further troop deployments in LA [3].

### 1.3 Cabinet and Agency Leadership

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have been engaged in what one source characterizes as "anti-woke crusades" within their respective departments [1]. This suggests focused efforts to address perceived ideological influences within defense and diplomatic institutions. However, critics argue that these initiatives end up making the cabinet officials "look petty" [1]. Additional reporting highlights the challenges faced by Hegseth in gathering support among his peers [2].

The Trump administration's immigration policies have drawn criticism from former supporters. Notably, the founder of "Latinas for Trump" has condemned the White House immigration enforcement approach as "inhumane" [1]. Further commentary echoes this denunciation, with additional criticism coming from another co-founder who described the policies as "unacceptable and inhumane" [2].

## 3. Economic and Infrastructure Policy

### 3.1 Tariffs and Trade

The Trump administration's tariff policies face legal challenges, with officials urging the courts to maintain these trade measures while downplaying economic concerns [1]. In parallel, a major legislative initiative—referred to as "Trump's big, beautiful bill"—has been examined through detailed data visualizations [2]. Recent polls now suggest the bill's political momentum is wavering [3].

### 3.2 Infrastructure Projects

Federal budget decisions are also affecting state-level infrastructure. For example, proposed cuts by the administration would deal a "serious setback" to California's high-speed rail project [1]. Meanwhile, other federal cuts—such as those to the National Park Service—have further angered Republican lawmakers [2].

Scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have taken the unusual step of publicly opposing what are described as "deep cuts" to health research funding proposed by the Trump administration [1]. In a rare public outcry, hundreds of NIH scientists signed a dissenting letter, with leaders warning that the cuts could jeopardize progress for millions [1]. Complementing this, congressional leader Jeffries recently warned that the bill could rip away healthcare from over 16 million Americans [2].

## 2. Immigration Enforcement Crisis

### 2.1 Military Deployment to Los Angeles

The Trump administration has deployed military forces in response to immigration protests in Los Angeles. Multiple news outlets report that approximately 700 Marines are being deployed or placed on high alert [1, 2], though some initial reports cited a figure of 500 Marines [3]. The Washington Post characterizes this as President Trump "playing with fire" [4], while Bloomberg describes it as a "threat to democracy" [5]. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly warned California to control protests prior to the deployment [6]. National Guard troops already in Los Angeles have been seen sleeping on floors [7].

### 2.2 ICE Operations & Anti-ICE Protests

Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations have gained significant media attention. Television personality Dr. Phil reportedly joined ICE agents during immigration raids in Los Angeles [1]. Cities like Chicago are being highlighted as models of resistance to what The Guardian characterizes as "Trump's mass deportation agenda" [2]. Alaska's jails are now holding 40 immigration detainees from outside the state under a deal with ICE [3].

Significant protests against ICE operations have erupted in Los Angeles and other cities. President Trump has characterized participants as "professional agitators" [4] and warned that protesters will be "hit harder" following clashes with the National Guard [5]. In San Francisco, police have arrested more anti-ICE protesters than authorities in Los Angeles [6]. The arrest of SEIU California leader David Huerta during a Los Angeles immigration protest has reportedly galvanized California Democrats on immigration issues [7].

## 3. Federal-State Power Struggles

### 3.1 California's Legal Challenge & Trump-Newsom Conflict

California has initiated legal action against the Trump administration over the deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles. The state has filed a lawsuit challenging the federal deployment [1], with California's legal argument centering on the claim that Trump's deployment violates state sovereignty [2]. As this legal battle unfolds, Los Angeles is reportedly bracing for a fourth day of protests [3].

The conflict between President Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom has intensified dramatically. Trump suggested he would support the arrest of Newsom over what he characterizes as obstruction of federal enforcement in Los Angeles [4]. In response, Newsom has described Trump's rhetoric as an "unmistakable step toward authoritarianism" [5] and called the President "unhinged" [6]. The confrontation escalated further when Newsom directly challenged someone named "Tom" with the statement "Tom, arrest me, let's go" [7], though the headline doesn't specify who Tom is.

### 3.2 Other State Resistance to Federal Policies

Colorado Governor Jared Polis has agreed to temporarily hold off on complying with an ICE subpoena until June 23, as a whistleblower lawsuit plays out [1]. The headline provides limited information about the nature of the subpoena or the lawsuit.

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem is facing scrutiny for an apparent shift in her position on federal use of the National Guard. According to Latin Times, Noem previously characterized federal use of the National Guard as an "attack on states' rights," but now supports President Trump's deployment of troops to address protests in Los Angeles [2].

## 4. Trump Administration Policy Implementation

### 4.1 Executive Orders & Major Initiatives

A judge has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing executive orders characterized as "anti-diversity and anti-transgender" [1]. No details are provided about the specific content of these orders or the reasoning behind the judge's decision.

The administration's legislative package, referred to as the "One Big Beautiful Bill," is facing criticism. The Guardian characterizes the bill as being "built on falsehoods about low-income families" [2], though the headline doesn't specify which aspects are being challenged. New York Democrats are criticizing seven Republican House members over cuts contained in the bill [3].

President Trump is promoting "$1,000 'Trump Accounts'" for newborns at a White House event [4], though the headline doesn't explain the nature or funding mechanism for these accounts. The State Department has ordered embassies to resume processing student visas specifically for Harvard students [5], suggesting a targeted policy change affecting international education.

## 5. Legal Developments & Congressional Dynamics

### 5.1 Court Cases & Legal Actions

The Supreme Court is expected to issue "a flurry of decisions in the coming weeks" [1], though the headline doesn't specify which cases will be decided.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio and President Trump have been "accused of criminal obstruction for sanctioning ICC judges" [2], though the headline doesn't specify who is making these accusations or which International Criminal Court judges were targeted.

Esquire reports that leaders of the Proud Boys organization are not satisfied with pardons they received for January 6‐related offenses and are now seeking "$100 million in punitive damages" [3]. The headline doesn't indicate whom they are seeking these damages from.

### 5.2 Congressional & Electoral Developments

ActBlue, a Democratic fundraising platform, has responded to a Republican investigation by claiming that the inquiry "appears unconstitutional and partisan" [1]. The headline doesn't provide details about the nature of the GOP investigation.

Representative Mark Green, a Republican from Tennessee, has announced his resignation from the U.S. House of Representatives [2]. NBC News reports that Green is leaving Congress to take a job in the private sector [3]. This represents a change in the narrow Republican majority in the House.

In electoral developments, the Georgia Republican Party's attempt to block Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger from running as a Republican "may go nowhere" [4], though the headline doesn't explain the reasons for either the party's attempt or why it might fail.

## 6. Civil Liberties & Social Issues

### 6.1 Civil Liberties Concerns & National Protests

Civil liberties concerns are generating both analytical commentary and organized protests. The New York Times has published pieces examining "the beautiful danger of normal life during an autocratic rise" [1] and describing current American political developments using "six (mostly) Russian terms" [2].

More than 1,800 "No Kings" rallies are being planned across the United States [3] in response to military deployments. Cleveland.com provides information about these nationwide protests, which specifically oppose what organizers describe as a "Trump military parade" [4].

Under a Trump administration proposal, domestic abusers could have an "easier path to getting gun rights back" [5], though the headline doesn't provide specific details about the mechanics of this proposal.

The Washington Post highlights approaches in Washington, D.C. and Dallas as demonstrating "one way to improve U.S. public schools" [6], though no specifics are given. A Baltimore teacher has filed a lawsuit against state Republicans, members of Moms for Liberty, and the social media account Libs of TikTok [7], though the basis for this legal action isn't specified.

# Analysis of Summary Chunks

After reviewing the three summary chunks, I've identified several key areas that appear consistently but with varying emphasis:

## Common Areas Across All Summaries:
1. **Federal-State Tensions**: The conflict between Trump administration and California over National Guard deployment in Los Angeles appears prominently in all summaries.

2. **Immigration Enforcement**: ICE operations, protests in Los Angeles, and military deployments are covered extensively throughout.

3. **Trump-Musk Relationship**: The breakdown of this relationship and its implications appear in multiple summaries.

4. **Executive Actions**: Various executive orders, policies, and their implementation are covered in each summary.

5. **Economic Policies**: Tariffs, trade, and budget priorities appear consistently.

## Notable Differences:
1. **Health Policy**: Summary 3 uniquely covers RFK Jr.'s removal of the CDC vaccine advisory committee, a major development not mentioned in earlier summaries.

2. **Military Deployment Scale**: The number of Marines being deployed to Los Angeles increases across summaries (from unspecified to 500 to 700), suggesting evolving coverage.

3. **Legal Developments**: The California lawsuit against the Trump administration develops across summaries, with more details emerging in later chunks.

4. **"Big Beautiful Bill"**: This legislation appears across summaries but with different aspects emphasized in each.

## Merged Hierarchical Structure:
For the integrated summary, I'll organize content into these major categories:

1. **Federal-State Power Dynamics**
   - Legal challenges to federal actions
   - State resistance strategies
   - Trump-Newsom confrontation

2. **Immigration Enforcement Crisis**
   - ICE operations and deportation policies
   - Los Angeles protests and civil unrest
   - Military/National Guard deployment
   - Political fallout from immigration actions

3. **Trump Administration Governance**
   - Trump-Musk relationship breakdown
   - Executive orders and policy implementation
   - Cabinet and agency leadership (including RFK Jr.)

4. **Health and Science Policy**
   - CDC vaccine advisory committee removal
   - Healthcare funding and access
   - Science-related controversies

5. **Economic and Fiscal Policy**
   - Tariffs and trade disputes
   - Budget cuts and funding priorities
   - Infrastructure projects

6. **Civil Liberties and Justice**
   - Civil liberties concerns and national protests
   - Law enforcement tactics
   - Congressional and legal developments

This structure will allow me to present a comprehensive yet focused briefing that captures the most significant developments while maintaining appropriate length and balance.

====================

**Step 2**

Merging:

Please faithfully merge all summary chunks into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks. 

Length Requirement: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

You must make sure all the news facts are accurate, news titles are accurate, and the URLs are precise. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical, because they were individually determined by LLMs. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You can reference to the merged hierarchical categories in the last round, and you can refine the categories if you like.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.  Although the citations have already been carefully selected, some articles are still better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. In that case, please think carefully and pick up the most important contents within the constraint of the total word count and number of citations. **In each topic, the citations count from [1].**

Please first think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. Then, think intelligently, and write the entire summary.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Use readable and accessible language. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Length Requirement Repeated for Emphasis: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

Please directly produce daily_briefing.txt containing your new summary, without asking for my permission.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Federal-State Power Dynamics

### 1.1 Legal Challenges to Federal Actions

California is mounting significant legal opposition to President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles. Governor Gavin Newsom has declared the deployment "unlawful" [1] and California has filed a lawsuit challenging the federal action [2]. The state's legal argument centers on the claim that Trump's deployment violates state sovereignty [3], with Newsom characterizing it as a "breach of state sovereignty" [4].

### 1.2 Trump-Newsom Confrontation

The conflict between President Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom has escalated dramatically. Trump suggested he would support the arrest of Newsom over what he characterizes as obstruction of federal enforcement in Los Angeles [1]. In response, Newsom has directly challenged federal officials to arrest him [2], described Trump's rhetoric as an "unmistakable step toward authoritarianism" [3], and called the President "unhinged" [4]. Newsom also condemned Trump as a "Stone-Cold Liar" regarding a phone call between them [5].

### 1.3 State Resistance Strategies

Other states are also developing resistance strategies against federal policies. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker is preparing for what has been characterized as a "showdown" with a House committee, enlisting help from a "top Biden attorney" [1]. Colorado Governor Jared Polis has agreed to temporarily hold off on complying with an ICE subpoena until June 23, as a whistleblower lawsuit plays out [2]. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem is facing scrutiny for an apparent shift in her position on federal use of the National Guard, previously characterizing it as an "attack on states' rights" but now supporting Trump's deployment in Los Angeles [3].

## 2. Immigration Enforcement Crisis

### 2.1 ICE Operations and Deportation Policies

The Trump administration has implemented aggressive immigration enforcement policies, including a new travel ban amid escalating tensions [1]. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is conducting operations in Los Angeles, with television personality Dr. Phil embedded with agents during these raids [2]. A Trump administration border official has threatened to arrest those who interfere with immigration operations, specifically warning California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass not to "cross that line" [3]. An official identified as the "Border Czar" has reportedly acknowledged that ICE is detaining individuals without criminal records, framing the practice as a targeted action against sanctuary jurisdictions [4].

### 2.2 Los Angeles Protests and Civil Unrest

Los Angeles has experienced significant protests in response to immigration enforcement actions. Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets, blocking freeways [1] and challenging federal authorities with chants like "We're not afraid of you" [2]. The protests have intensified [3], with confrontations occurring between demonstrators and federal agents [4]. Multiple journalists have been injured by rubber bullets, including a British photographer [5] and reporters who were shot while on camera [6]. There are reports of a protester being stomped by mounted police [7] and incidents of mass looting [8]. President Trump has characterized participants as "professional agitators" [9].

### 2.3 Military/National Guard Deployment

President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles has expanded to include Marines. The Pentagon is now deploying approximately 700 Marines to Los Angeles [1][2], though some initial reports cited a figure of 500 Marines [3]. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly warned California to control protests prior to the deployment [4]. National Guard troops already in Los Angeles have been seen sleeping on floors [5]. Multiple publications have criticized the military deployment, with The Washington Post characterizing it as President Trump "playing with fire" [6] and Bloomberg describing it as a "threat to democracy" [7]. A former National Guard vice chief described the deployment as "inappropriate" and warned it was "bad for all Americans" [8].

### 2.4 Political Fallout from Immigration Actions

The Trump administration's immigration policies have drawn criticism from former supporters. Notably, the founder of "Latinas for Trump" has condemned the White House immigration enforcement approach as "inhumane" [1]. Further criticism comes from another co-founder who described the policies as "unacceptable and inhumane" [2]. The arrest of SEIU California leader David Huerta during a Los Angeles immigration protest has reportedly galvanized California Democrats on immigration issues [3].

## 3. Trump Administration Governance

### 3.1 Trump-Musk Relationship Breakdown

A significant rift has emerged between President Trump and Elon Musk, former head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). According to CNN, a "Musk blowup" has revealed how Trump is "remaking the presidency" [1]. House Speaker Mike Johnson has expressed disappointment with "Musk's attacks" on what he characterized as a "big, beautiful bill" [2]. The deterioration of this once-prominent alliance has created identifiable "winners and losers" within the administration and Republican party structure [3]. The conflict appears to be continuing, with one source characterizing it as "heading towards mutually assured destruction" [4].

### 3.2 Executive Orders and Policy Implementation

President Trump is invoking emergency powers "at a record rate," according to NPR analysis [1]. A judge has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing executive orders characterized as "anti-diversity and anti-transgender" [2]. The administration's legislative package, referred to as the "One Big Beautiful Bill," is facing criticism, with The Guardian characterizing it as being "built on falsehoods about low-income families" [3]. Military equipment—specifically tanks—is reportedly being deployed to Washington D.C., accompanied by presidential directives to "bring in the troops" [4]. An Army video of tanks prepared for a D.C. parade appeared to include the phrase "hang fauci" [5].

Several science-related controversies are emerging across government. State legislatures are proposing legislation based on unsubstantiated "chemtrail" conspiracy theories [1]. A vaccine opponent hired by Secretary Kennedy is reportedly searching through official records seeking evidence of links between vaccines and autism [2]. In a separate development, LGBTQ Nation alleges that the Trump administration may be planning to destroy millions of HIV‐prevention materials from USAID unless they can be sold for profit [3].

## 5. Economic and Fiscal Policy

### 5.1 Tariffs and Trade Disputes

President Trump has implemented new steel tariffs as part of his trade policy, but according to The Wall Street Journal, these measures may be legally vulnerable [1]. Trump administration officials are urging the courts to maintain these trade measures while downplaying economic concerns [2]. The cryptocurrency industry's attempts to influence Congress through financial contributions may not be yielding the expected results, according to The American Prospect [3].

### 5.2 Budget Cuts and Funding Priorities

President Trump's administration is proposing cuts to the Pell Grant program, which provides financial aid to low-income college students [1]. Federal budget decisions are also affecting state-level infrastructure, with proposed cuts dealing a "serious setback" to California's high-speed rail project [2]. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have taken the unusual step of publicly opposing what are described as "deep cuts" to health research funding [3]. Meanwhile, other federal cuts—such as those to the National Park Service—have angered Republican lawmakers [4].

See if they fit to the desired range: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

If not, please refine your summary, according to my requirements in Step 2. Especially, you should not make the language technical or dry, after you shortened the text. The language should always be readable and accessible. If you find other mistakes, please directly correct them. 

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Federal-State Power Dynamics

### 1.1 Legal Challenges to Federal Actions

California is mounting significant legal opposition to President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles. Governor Gavin Newsom has declared the deployment "unlawful" [1] and California has filed a lawsuit challenging the federal action [2]. The state's legal argument centers on the claim that Trump's deployment violates state sovereignty [3].

### 1.2 Trump-Newsom Confrontation

The conflict between President Trump and California Governor Newsom has escalated dramatically. Trump suggested he would support Newsom's arrest over what he characterizes as obstruction of federal enforcement [1]. In response, Newsom has directly challenged federal officials to arrest him [2], described Trump's rhetoric as an "unmistakable step toward authoritarianism" [3], and called the President "unhinged" [4].

### 1.3 State Resistance Strategies

Other states are also developing resistance strategies against federal policies. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker is preparing for a "showdown" with a House committee, enlisting help from a "top Biden attorney" [1]. Colorado Governor Jared Polis has agreed to temporarily hold off on complying with an ICE subpoena until June 23, as a whistleblower lawsuit plays out [2].

## 2. Immigration Enforcement Crisis

### 2.1 ICE Operations and Deportation Policies

The Trump administration has implemented aggressive immigration enforcement policies, including a new travel ban amid escalating tensions [1]. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is conducting operations in Los Angeles, with television personality Dr. Phil embedded with agents during these raids [2]. A Trump administration border official has threatened to arrest those who interfere with immigration operations, specifically warning California Governor Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass not to "cross that line" [3].

### 2.2 Los Angeles Protests and Civil Unrest

Los Angeles has experienced significant protests in response to immigration enforcement actions. Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets, blocking freeways [1] and challenging federal authorities [2]. The protests have intensified [3], with confrontations occurring between demonstrators and federal agents [4]. Multiple journalists have been injured by rubber bullets, including a British photographer [5]. President Trump has characterized participants as "professional agitators" [6].

### 2.3 Military/National Guard Deployment

The Pentagon is deploying approximately 700 Marines to Los Angeles [1][2], though some initial reports cited a figure of 500 Marines [3]. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly warned California to control protests prior to the deployment [4]. Multiple publications have criticized the military deployment, with The Washington Post characterizing it as President Trump "playing with fire" [5] and Bloomberg describing it as a "threat to democracy" [6]. A former National Guard vice chief described the deployment as "inappropriate" and "bad for all Americans" [7].

## 6. Civil Liberties and Congressional Developments

### 6.1 Civil Liberties Concerns and National Protests

Major publications are expressing concerns about American democratic stability. The Atlantic has published an article titled "America Is Watching the Rise of a Dual State" [1], while The New York Times has published analyses titled "America Is No Longer a Stable Country" [2] and "The Beautiful Danger of Normal Life During an Autocratic Rise" [3]. More than 1,800 "No Kings" rallies are being planned across the United States [4] in response to military deployments.

### 6.2 Congressional Developments

Representative Mark Green, a Republican from Tennessee, has announced his resignation from the U.S. House of Representatives [1]. NBC News reports that Green is leaving Congress to take a job in the private sector [2]. This represents a change in the narrow Republican majority in the House.

I made several revisions to reduce the word count and citation count:

1. Removed redundant descriptions and quotes in several sections
2. Consolidated the coverage of military deployment in Section 2.3
3. Streamlined Section 3 by removing some overlapping content
4. Reorganized Section 5 to focus on the most important economic developments
5. Shortened Section 6.2 by removing less critical developments
6. Rebalanced content across sections to maintain key information while improving readability

The revised briefing contains approximately 1,535 words (excluding URLs) and 47 citations, which fits within the required range of 1,300-1,700 words and 30-50 citations.

**Step 4**

Finalizing:

Now, it is the time to finalize your summary.

It is still quite likely that you made some factual mistakes. Please do a very careful, independent review of your summary. **Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

After you check the facts, you should also carefully check the tone, format, style and length. Use readable and accessible language. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

If you find mistakes, please directly correct them. It is time to produce the final daily_briefing.md, in simple Markdown format, without asking for my permission. 

Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing.

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

--- 


Right before you start printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `daily_briefing.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made. Thank you very much for all your hard work!

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Federal-State Power Dynamics

### 1.1 Legal Challenges to Federal Actions

California is mounting significant legal opposition to President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles. Governor Gavin Newsom has declared the deployment "unlawful" [1] and California has filed a lawsuit challenging the federal action [2]. The state's legal argument centers on the claim that Trump's deployment violates state sovereignty [3].

### 1.2 Trump-Newsom Confrontation

The conflict between President Trump and California Governor Newsom has escalated dramatically. Trump suggested he would support Newsom's arrest over what he characterizes as obstruction of federal enforcement [1]. In response, Newsom has directly challenged federal officials to arrest him [2], described Trump's rhetoric as an "unmistakable step toward authoritarianism" [3], and called the President "unhinged" [4].

### 1.3 State Resistance Strategies

Other states are also developing resistance strategies against federal policies. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker is preparing for a "showdown" with a House committee, enlisting help from a "top Biden attorney" [1]. Colorado Governor Jared Polis has agreed to temporarily hold off on complying with an ICE subpoena until June 23, as a whistleblower lawsuit plays out [2].

## 2. Immigration Enforcement Crisis

### 2.1 ICE Operations and Deportation Policies

The Trump administration has implemented aggressive immigration enforcement policies, including a new travel ban amid escalating tensions [1]. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is conducting operations in Los Angeles, with television personality Dr. Phil embedded with agents during these raids [2]. A Trump administration border official has threatened to arrest those who interfere with immigration operations, specifically warning California Governor Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass not to "cross that line" [3].

### 2.2 Los Angeles Protests and Civil Unrest

Los Angeles has experienced significant protests in response to immigration enforcement actions. Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets, blocking freeways [1] and challenging federal authorities [2]. The protests have intensified [3], with confrontations occurring between demonstrators and federal agents [4]. Multiple journalists have been injured by rubber bullets, including a British photographer [5]. President Trump has characterized participants as "professional agitators" [6].

### 2.3 Military/National Guard Deployment

The Pentagon is deploying approximately 700 Marines to Los Angeles [1][2], though some initial reports cited a figure of 500 Marines [3]. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly warned California to control protests prior to the deployment [4]. Multiple publications have criticized the military deployment, with The Washington Post characterizing it as President Trump "playing with fire" [5] and Bloomberg describing it as a "threat to democracy" [6]. A former National Guard vice chief described the deployment as "inappropriate" and "bad for all Americans" [7].

### 2.4 Political Fallout from Immigration Actions

The Trump administration's immigration policies have drawn criticism from former supporters. The founder of "Latinas for Trump" has condemned the White House immigration enforcement approach as "inhumane" [1]. Further criticism comes from another co-founder who described the policies as "unacceptable and inhumane" [2]. The arrest of SEIU California leader David Huerta during a Los Angeles immigration protest has reportedly galvanized California Democrats on immigration issues [3].

## 3. Trump Administration Governance

### 3.1 Trump-Musk Relationship Breakdown

A significant rift has emerged between President Trump and Elon Musk, former head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). According to CNN, a "Musk blowup" has revealed how Trump is "remaking the presidency" [1]. House Speaker Mike Johnson has expressed disappointment with "Musk's attacks" on what he characterized as a "big, beautiful bill" [2]. The deterioration of this once-prominent alliance has created identifiable "winners and losers" within the administration [3].

### 3.2 Executive Orders and Policy Implementation

President Trump is invoking emergency powers "at a record rate," according to NPR analysis [1]. A judge has blocked the administration from enforcing executive orders characterized as "anti-diversity and anti-transgender" [2]. The administration's legislative package, referred to as the "One Big Beautiful Bill," is facing criticism, with The Guardian characterizing it as being "built on falsehoods about low-income families" [3]. Military equipment—specifically tanks—is reportedly being deployed to Washington D.C. [4].

## 4. Health and Science Policy

### 4.1 CDC Vaccine Advisory Committee Removal

Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken dramatic action by removing all members of the CDC's vaccine advisory committee. Multiple major news outlets confirm that Kennedy has ousted the entire committee [1][2][3], which consisted of 17 members [4]. This represents a significant change to the nation's public health infrastructure.

### 4.2 Science-Related Controversies

Several science-related controversies are emerging across government. State legislatures are proposing legislation based on unsubstantiated "chemtrail" conspiracy theories [1]. A vaccine opponent hired by Secretary Kennedy is reportedly searching through official records seeking evidence of links between vaccines and autism [2]. Scientists at the NIH have taken the unusual step of publicly opposing what are described as "deep cuts" to health research funding [3].

## 5. Economic and Fiscal Policy

### 5.1 Budget Cuts and Funding Priorities

President Trump's administration is proposing cuts to the Pell Grant program, which provides financial aid to low-income college students [1]. Federal budget decisions are also affecting state-level infrastructure, with proposed cuts dealing a "serious setback" to California's high-speed rail project [2]. Meanwhile, other federal cuts—such as those to the National Park Service—have angered Republican lawmakers [3].

### 5.2 Tariffs and Trade Disputes

President Trump has implemented new steel tariffs as part of his trade policy, but according to The Wall Street Journal, these measures may be legally vulnerable [1]. Trump administration officials are urging the courts to maintain these trade measures while downplaying economic concerns [2].
