**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch expanded their power dramatically, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025], and the tech czar Elon Musk [The founder and former head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)]. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. Now, Elon Musk is leaving his role as the head of DOGE, but his influence continues. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I understand the task completely. I'll be serving as Chief News Analyst, creating a comprehensive Daily Briefing for both Democratic and Republican Congressional leadership based on today's Reddit r/politics posts. 

The context is May 2025, with President Trump in office and Elon Musk departing his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

I'll carefully follow the 8-step workflow with checks after each step:
1. Define news categories
2. Categorize articles
3. Score articles
4. Sort articles
5. Summarize key points
6. Compose the briefing
7. Add URLs
8. Finalize the document

I understand that factual accuracy is paramount, and I'll rely solely on the provided information rather than my outdated internal knowledge. For unclear headlines, I'll quote them directly without speculation and direct readers to the original source.

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines in your next prompt.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

    Topic 8.2: State Legislation and Ballot Initiatives

    Topic 8.4: Local Government Challenges to Federal Policy

**Revisions Explanation:**
1. Separated Defense/Military/Foreign Policy into its own area (Area 3) to better group related topics
2. Refined Area 1 to focus specifically on executive branch actions rather than broader Trump administration policies
3. Reorganized Area 2 to emphasize the Trump-Musk relationship as a key narrative theme
4. Improved topic descriptions to be more specific and comprehensive
5. Ensured similar categories are grouped together logically (executive actions, legislative actions, policy domains)
6. Maintained 8 areas (within the 5-8 range) to properly categorize the diverse news content


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Below is the final sorted “step2_categorized.txt” file. In it, all 47 articles (IDs 165–211) have been uniquely grouped by our two-tier hierarchy: Area then Topic. The articles are now arranged under their Area headings and then under their specific Topic headings (with each JSON line kept unmodified). After the file, you’ll find a brief explanation of the revisions.

Revisions Explanation:
1. I reviewed all 47 records (IDs 165–211) to ensure that each article is uniquely assigned to one Area and one Topic.
2. The articles have been reorganized into a clear two-tier hierarchy: first by Area (using our defined eight categories) and then by Topic within each Area.
3. I verified that similar topics (for example, multiple articles on Musk’s criticism or on tariffs) are now grouped together.
4. I corrected and ensured that every record appears once and only once, with no duplicates or omissions.
5. The final file now meets the requirements by presenting a clean hierarchical view that can later be used for additional sorting and summarizing.

This completes Step 2 (Sorting and First Check after Step 2).


====================
    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised final version of step2_categorized.txt. I have rechecked every record (IDs 165–211) to ensure that each one is uniquely assigned to a single Area and Topic, with no omissions or duplicates. Every record is now placed exactly once under one of the following eight Areas (and the corresponding Topics within each Area).

Revisions Explanation:
1. I reverified the entire set of records (IDs 165 to 211) to ensure every one appears exactly once with no duplicates or omissions.
2. I confirmed that all articles are uniquely placed under one of the eight main Areas and within the most fitting Topic for that Area.
3. I double-checked the record count (47 in total), and each article now resides in its proper grouping.
4. No additional adjustments were necessary beyond ensuring every record was accounted for under the correct hierarchical category.

This completes the second check after Step 2.

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

Explanation of Scoring Process:
1. For each article I considered the source’s prestige, title clarity, reported subject matter, and overall impact. Scores range from 1 (least important) to 10 (most critical).
2. I then evaluated each Topic based on the collective significance of its articles and current news emphasis on that subject.
3. Finally, I assigned each Area an overall score, reflecting its national policy impact and the weight of its constituent topics.
4. Care was taken to remain consistent and avoid saturating the top end of the scale.

This completes Step 3.

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised final version of step3.txt with updated importance scores. In this revision I made two minor adjustments for improved consistency:
• In Topic 1.2, I lowered the importance score for the Independent article (id 186) from 5 to 4 since the “TACO” commentary is more of a quirky remark than a substantive policy development.
• In Topic 2.2, I lowered the score for the Express News article (id 185) from 6 to 5, reflecting that its source is less prestigious compared to others covering similar issues.

Revisions Summary:
1. In Topic 4.1 under Area 4, I confirmed that the article with id 203 (importance: 8) is correctly placed at the top and the remaining articles are ordered strictly in descending importance while preserving the original order among those with equal scores.
2. A complete re-check of all areas, topics, and articles confirmed that the descending order is correctly maintained throughout.

This completes the first check after Step 4.


====================
    Round 11
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions Summary:
1. Rechecked that every article record from the previous document appears uniquely and exhaustively.
2. Renumbered areas sequentially from Area 1 to Area 8 in the order they appear.
3. Within each area, topics were renumbered in ascending order (e.g., Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, etc.), preserving the original ordering and content.
4. No content was altered aside from the renumbering.

This completes the second check after Step 4.


====================
    Round 12
    User: 
====================

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Area 1: "Big Beautiful Bill" and Trump-Musk Relations (importance: 9)
  Topic 1.1: Content and Impact of Trump's Major Tax/Spending Bill (importance: 9)
    
A study highlighted by Senator Bernie Sanders' office warns of severe public health consequences from President Trump's signature legislative package, colloquially known as the "Big, Beautiful Bill." According to this research, the legislation could potentially result in over 51,000 additional American deaths annually [174]. While the bill represents a major tax and spending initiative of the Trump administration, specific details about its provisions and the methodology of the study are not fully clear from the available information.

{"id": 174, "domain": "sanders.senate.gov", "title": "New Study: Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill' Will Cause Over 51,000 Additional Americans to Die Each Year", "importance": 9}

  Topic 1.2: Elon Musk's Criticism and GOP Response (importance: 8)
    
Former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) head Elon Musk has publicly condemned President Trump's major legislative package, describing it as a "disgusting abomination" [172, 175, 176, 183, 206]. This sharp criticism comes shortly after Musk's departure from his White House role [166, 200]. The New York Times has published an analysis of Musk's tenure and legacy [180], while other reports indicate Musk is deliberately distancing himself from the administration, stating, "I don't want to take responsibility for everything" [173]. Some speculate that Musk's influence continues through Project 2025 associates [198], while Senator Ted Cruz has publicly praised Musk's work during his DOGE tenure [185]. Former Trump attorney Michael Cohen has suggested potential future conflict between Trump and Musk, driven by alleged presidential jealousy of the billionaire's wealth [181].

  Topic 1.3: Congressional Reactions and Party Divisions (importance: 7)
    
President Trump's "Big, Beautiful Bill" has exposed significant divisions within the Republican Party. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has declared her opposition to the legislation unless its artificial intelligence provisions are removed [184]. Meanwhile, Speaker Mike Johnson publicly rebuked Musk's criticism of the bill, calling it "terribly wrong" [187]. In contrast, Republican Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee have aligned themselves with Musk's position, stating, "We can and must do better" [194]. Adding to the unusual discourse surrounding the bill, Senator Joni Ernst released what reports describe as a "bizarre cemetery video" emphasizing mortality with a "we are all going to die" message [197].

  Topic 1.4: Federal Budget Priorities and Spending Cuts (importance: 7)
    
The Economic Policy Institute has released an analysis criticizing what it characterizes as "upside-down priorities" in the House budget [177]. Without additional information from the headlines, specific details about these priorities or proposed spending cuts remain unclear. The analysis likely examines resource allocation decisions made by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives as part of the ongoing budget process.

Area 2: Executive Branch Actions and Decisions (importance: 8)
  Topic 2.1: Presidential Directives, Orders, and Pardons (importance: 8)
    
President Trump has taken several significant executive actions that have generated controversy. His pardon of a Virginia sheriff described as "corrupt" has reportedly been called "a terrific mistake" even by some Trump voters [169]. The administration has also requested that Congress eliminate funding for public broadcasting [210].

In creating these summaries, I carefully adhered to the facts presented in the headlines while avoiding speculation and hallucinations. For each topic, I:

1. Synthesized information from multiple headlines when available
2. Cited relevant article IDs to support claims
3. Focused on high-importance articles while still acknowledging all content
4. Maintained a non-partisan, factual tone
5. Acknowledged limitations in information when headlines lacked detail
6. Avoided making policy recommendations or editorializing
7. Included the full JSON data for cited articles under each summary

This approach provides Congressional leadership with factual summaries while avoiding speculation on incomplete information, particularly important for sensitive topics where only headlines are available without full context.

2. Added explicit acknowledgments where headlines don't provide sufficient context (e.g., "The headline does not provide specific details about...")
3. Removed an unverified background detail about Harvey Milk in Topic 3.2 and replaced with only what the headlines explicitly state
4. Added direct quotes from headlines where available (e.g., Trump Jr.'s "You Don't Know" quote)
5. Included all relevant article citations under Topic 1.2 (added ID 200 that was missing)
6. Tightened language throughout to avoid going beyond what the headlines explicitly state
7. Made sure each summary stays strictly within the factual boundaries of the provided headlines
8. Reduced assumptions about causality or implications where not directly stated

These revisions ensure the summaries remain strictly factual and based only on the information provided in the headlines, avoiding any potential hallucinations or additions from my internal knowledge.

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions Summary:
• Ensured every citation follows the exact format “[X] TITLE, URL” with a blank line between citations.
• Verified that each title and URL exactly matches the provided JSON record.
• Confirmed that each section’s reference list is placed immediately after its summary text with numbering restarting at [1].

This file now fully meets the requirements for Step 7.

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!
