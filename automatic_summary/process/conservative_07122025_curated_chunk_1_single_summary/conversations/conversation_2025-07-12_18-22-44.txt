**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is July, 2025. The executive branch expanded their power dramatically, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025], and the tech czar Elon Musk [The founder and former head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)]. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. Later, Elon Musk left DOGE, but his influence continues. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/Conservative.**

r/Conservative is a subreddit dedicated to discussion and content from a conservative political perspective, primarily in the context of U.S. politics. Here's a brief overview:
**Focus:** Conservative values, ideas, and viewpoints.
**Content:** News articles, political commentary, opinion pieces, and discussions supportive of or aligned with right-leaning ideologies.
**Tone:** The subreddit encourages civil discourse among conservatives and welcomes questions from others, though it's not meant to be a debate forum for opposing views.
**Common Topics:** Fiscal conservatism, limited government, gun rights, immigration policy, criticism of liberal/progressive policies, and support for Republican politicians and platforms.

It's heavily moderated to maintain a conservative-friendly space, and moderation tends to enforce rules that limit trolling or ideological arguments from non-conservatives.

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I am ready.

I have fully processed the scenario, my role as Chief News Analyst for both parties, and the critical importance of objectivity and factual accuracy based *only* on the provided information. I understand the background context of July 2025, the key political figures, and the nature of the source subreddit, r/Conservative.

I will meticulously follow the 8-step process you have outlined, completing one step at a time and awaiting your next prompt.

Please provide the JSONL lines for today's news feed. I am prepared to begin.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    Round 2
    Assistant: 
====================

Based on a thorough review of all 74 headlines, I have defined the following hierarchical categories to organize the day's news. The structure is designed to group related events logically, moving from the direct actions of the federal government to domestic policy, the economy, and international affairs.

Area 1: Executive Branch: Internal Conflicts & Operations
    Topic 1.1: DOJ/FBI Personnel Turmoil Regarding the Epstein Case
    Topic 1.2: Assassination Attempt Investigations and Agency Scrutiny
    Topic 1.3: Other Presidential Directives & Departmental Actions

Area 2: Immigration & Border Security
    Topic 2.1: ICE Enforcement, Judicial Rulings, and Federal-Local Clashes
    Topic 2.2: Asylum Policy, Lawsuits, and International Rulings
    Topic 2.3: Economic and Criminal Aspects of Border Issues

Area 3: Economic & Trade Policy
    Topic 3.1: Tariffs and International Trade Disputes
    Topic 3.2: U.S. Fiscal Performance and Budget
    Topic 3.3: Strategic Industries and Corporate Relations

Area 4: Domestic Politics, Judiciary, and Culture
    Topic 4.1: Non-Immigration Judicial Actions and Controversies
    Topic 4.2: Partisan Commentary and Criticisms of Political Figures
    Topic 4.3: Election Integrity and Voting Regulations
    Topic 4.4: Media, Technology, and Cultural Debates

Area 5: Foreign Affairs & National Security
    Topic 5.1: Geopolitical Strategy and Threats
    Topic 5.2: Foreign Domestic Policies and Events
    Topic 5.3: Foreign Intelligence and Espionage Allegations

Area 6: Miscellaneous & Uncategorizable
    Topic 6.1: Headlines Lacking Specifics for Categorization


====================
    Round 3
    User: 
====================

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.


====================
    Round 3
    Assistant: 
====================

I have carefully reviewed the initial category structure against the provided requirements and the full set of headlines. The goal was to ensure the categories are comprehensive, logically organized, and cognitively intuitive for the intended audience of Democratic and Republican leadership.

The existing structure is robust and effectively organizes the diverse news items. The flow from the direct actions and internal state of the Executive Branch outwards to domestic policy, the economy, and finally foreign affairs is logical. Major, multi-headline stories like the DOJ/FBI turmoil and the immigration enforcement battles are given their own dedicated topics, which correctly reflects their prominence in the news cycle.

Upon review, I have determined that the original structure is optimal and requires no changes. It successfully meets all criteria: it is a two-tiered hierarchy, contains 6 areas (within the 5-8 limit), groups similar topics effectively, and provides a clear and logical framework for analyzing the news.

---

### Revisions Analysis

No changes were made to the category list after this review. The initial categorization proved to be well-structured and aligned with the goals of the briefing. The existing areas and topics provide a clear, comprehensive, and non-overlapping map of the current political landscape as presented in the news feed. The structure is ready for the next step of populating it with the specific articles.

### step1.txt

Area 1: Executive Branch: Internal Conflicts & Operations
    Topic 1.1: DOJ/FBI Personnel Turmoil Regarding the Epstein Case
    Topic 1.2: Assassination Attempt Investigations and Agency Scrutiny
    Topic 1.3: Other Presidential Directives & Departmental Actions

Area 2: Immigration & Border Security
    Topic 2.1: ICE Enforcement, Judicial Rulings, and Federal-Local Clashes
    Topic 2.2: Asylum Policy, Lawsuits, and International Rulings
    Topic 2.3: Economic and Criminal Aspects of Border Issues

Area 3: Economic & Trade Policy
    Topic 3.1: Tariffs and International Trade Disputes
    Topic 3.2: U.S. Fiscal Performance and Budget
    Topic 3.3: Strategic Industries and Corporate Relations

Area 4: Domestic Politics, Judiciary, and Culture
    Topic 4.1: Non-Immigration Judicial Actions and Controversies
    Topic 4.2: Partisan Commentary and Criticisms of Political Figures
    Topic 4.3: Election Integrity and Voting Regulations
    Topic 4.4: Media, Technology, and Cultural Debates

Area 5: Foreign Affairs & National Security
    Topic 5.1: Geopolitical Strategy and Threats
    Topic 5.2: Foreign Domestic Policies and Events
    Topic 5.3: Foreign Intelligence and Espionage Allegations

Area 6: Miscellaneous & Uncategorizable
    Topic 6.1: Headlines Lacking Specifics for Categorization


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 4

I have processed all 74 news articles, assigning each to the most appropriate category and topic defined in Step 1. The following list maintains the original chronological order of the articles based on their ID numbers.

====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 5
    Assistant: 
====================

I have completed the sorting and verification process. Upon careful review, I confirmed that all 74 articles were assigned to a category in the previous step and that the assignments were logical. My cross-check confirmed no articles were missed or duplicated. My initial categorization stands as robust, and no articles needed to be moved between categories. The main task in this step was restructuring the categorized list into the required hierarchical format.

---
### Revisions Analysis

No re-categorization of articles was necessary after a detailed review. The process confirmed the initial assignments were correct. The primary change was the reformatting and sorting of the previously flat, chronologically-ordered list into a hierarchical structure organized by Area and then by Topic. A minor summation error was caught and corrected during my internal verification process, confirming that all 74 articles are present and correctly sorted.

====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant: 
====================

After conducting a second, independent and thorough review of all 74 articles, I have confirmed that the initial categorization remains accurate and appropriate. Each article has been uniquely and exhaustively placed into the most suitable area and topic.

---
### Revisions Analysis

The purpose of this step was to perform a critical re-evaluation of the work done previously. I have cross-referenced every article against the category definitions and against other potential categories. My conclusion is that the existing structure is the most logical and correct representation of the provided news items.

*   **Exhaustiveness and Uniqueness:** The check confirmed that all 74 articles are present in the list, and each appears only once. The total count per category sums correctly to 74.
*   **Categorization Appropriateness:** I reconsidered several articles that could potentially fit in more than one category. For instance, articles on GOP resolutions about the assassination attempt (e.g., ID 18) or judicial rulings on ICE (e.g., ID 21) were confirmed to be best placed by their primary subject matter (Executive Branch security failure and a specific Immigration clash, respectively) rather than by the actor (Legislature, Judiciary). This maintains the thematic coherence of the briefing.

Ultimately, no changes were required. The following document is identical to the previous step's output, but is now presented with the added confidence of having passed a rigorous second verification.

====================
    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

I have completed the scoring process. Each article, topic, and area has been assigned an importance score from 1 to 10 based on a consistent rubric evaluating source reliability, policy impact, factual specificity, and relevance to Congressional leadership.

The scoring prioritizes actionable intelligence: direct executive actions, significant inter-branch or intra-branch conflicts, major judicial rulings, and credible national security threats receive the highest scores. Partisan commentary and vague or low-impact headlines are scored lower.

The final output is compiled in the `step3.txt` file below, with importance scores integrated into the hierarchical structure.

    Round 8

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

After a thorough re-evaluation of the scoring, I have made a few minor adjustments to improve consistency and more accurately reflect the potential impact of certain news items. The core structure and the majority of scores remain the same, as the initial assessment was largely sound.

### Revisions Analysis

1.  **Increased Score for Combined Developments (ID 66):** The score for the article "Reports: Metadata shows Epstein tape was edited and saved multiple times; Bongino takes leave of absence after spat with AG Bondi" (ID 66) was increased from 8 to 9. This report uniquely combines two major factual developments: a technical claim about evidence tampering and a concrete personnel action (a leave of absence) by the FBI Deputy Director. This combination makes it the most significant single article in the DOJ/FBI turmoil a-topic, warranting a higher score.

2.  **Adjusted Score for Vague but Evocative Headline (ID 57):** The score for "The Friday Night Massacre at State Department" (ID 57) was increased from 4 to 5. While the headline from `hotair.com` is vague, the term "Friday Night Massacre" is historically significant and implies a major, potentially disruptive personnel event. The score was raised slightly to better reflect the headline's implicit gravity and the need for situational awareness, even pending more detailed reports.

3.  **Decreased Score for Case Resolution Announcement (ID 69):** The score for "Bondi says all charges against doctor who allegedly destroyed COVID vaccines have been dropped" (ID 69) was decreased from 6 to 5. Re-evaluation determined that while this announcement from the Attorney General is noteworthy, it represents the conclusion of a past case rather than a new executive action, policy change, or judicial ruling. Its importance is slightly lower than other actions, and a score of 5 better aligns it with other similar items.

These refinements ensure the scoring system better distinguishes between developing crises, significant but vague reports, and routine administrative announcements. The overall importance scores for all Areas and Topics remain unchanged.

====================
    Round 9
    User:

**Step 4 (logic-heavy)**

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 9
    Assistant: 
====================

I have completed the sorting process as instructed. The entire document has been reorganized based on the importance scores assigned in the previous step. The sorting was performed at three levels:

1.  **Areas:** Sorted from the highest to the lowest importance score.
2.  **Topics:** Within each area, topics are sorted from highest to lowest importance.
3.  **Articles:** Within each topic, individual news articles are sorted from highest to lowest importance.

In all cases where importance scores were tied, the original submission order was preserved to maintain a stable sort. All information from the previous step, including IDs, domains, titles, and importance scores, has been retained.

The final, sorted structure is presented below in the `step4.txt` file.
