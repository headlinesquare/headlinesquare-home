**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I understand the task and context. You're asking me to create a comprehensive, objective Daily Briefing for both Democratic and Republican congressional leadership based on news from r/politics in an alternate May 2025 scenario where President Trump and Elon Musk (as DOGE head) have expanded executive power.

I'll follow the 8-step workflow you outlined, focusing on factual accuracy and relying solely on the information provided in the headlines rather than my internal knowledge (which would be outdated for this May 2025 scenario).

I'll analyze the news feed objectively, considering source domains and headlines while avoiding speculation when information is limited. I'll be cautious about political figures' titles and positions, defaulting to the information provided in your lists.

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines in your next prompt.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

====================

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

    Round 3
    Assistant: 
====================

# step1.txt

Area 1: Trump Administration & Executive Actions
    Topic 1.1: Executive Orders & Policy Implementation
    Topic 1.2: Cabinet & Administration Personnel
    Topic 1.3: Federal Agencies & Reorganization
    Topic 1.4: Religious & Social Conservative Policies

Area 2: Economic & Fiscal Policy
    Topic 2.1: Tariffs & International Trade
    Topic 2.2: Tax Legislation & Fiscal Policy

    Topic 2.4: Rural & Agricultural Development

Area 3: Legal Developments & Immigration
    Topic 3.1: Supreme Court Decisions
    Topic 3.2: Venezuelan TPS & Deportation Policies
    Topic 3.3: Law Enforcement & Legal Settlements

    Topic 4.3: Elon Musk's Status & Controversies
    Topic 4.4: Technology Regulation & AI Policy

Area 5: Foreign Policy & International Relations
    Topic 5.1: Russia-Ukraine Conflict
    Topic 5.2: China Relations & Global Influence
    Topic 5.3: European Relations & NATO
    Topic 5.4: Middle East Policy & Israel

Area 6: Media & Political Discourse
    Topic 6.1: Media Leadership & Trump Media Relations
    Topic 6.2: Biden's Health & Democratic Politics
    Topic 6.3: Political Investigations & Conspiracy Theories
    Topic 6.4: Culture War Issues & DEI

Area 7: Congressional & State Politics
    Topic 7.1: Legislative Agenda & Congressional Actions
    Topic 7.2: State Legislative Actions
    Topic 7.3: Local Government Issues
    Topic 7.4: Electoral Politics

I've revised the categories to better organize the news articles by:
1. Restructuring the areas to group similar topics together more logically
2. Renaming topics to better reflect the specific content of the articles
3. Creating clearer distinctions between federal executive actions (Area 1) and congressional/state activities (Area 7)
4. Dedicating specific topics to Venezuelan TPS issues and Elon Musk controversies, which appear in multiple articles
5. Ensuring each area has a balanced number of topics (4 per area) that can accommodate all articles


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Each article now appears just once with its unique category assignment. 

────────────────────────────
Brief explanation of the revisions and decisions:
1. Every headline was carefully read and matched against our 7 defined Areas and 4 Topics within each Area.
2. For ambiguous pieces (such as those involving Trump’s policies affecting both economic and executive actions, or topics combining celebrity and conspiracy elements) I chose the category that best captures the article’s core focus.
3. Articles involving Venezuelan protections have been consistently grouped in Area 3, Topic 3.2.
4. DOGE-related and Elon Musk controversy pieces are grouped in Area 4, with further nuance between program cuts (Topic 4.2), takeover/legal challenges (Topic 4.1), and personal controversies (Topic 4.3).
5. Legislative and local/state issues are placed in Area 7, using Topics 7.1 (Legislative Agenda), 7.2 (State Actions), 7.3 (Local Government), or 7.4 (Electoral Politics) as fits.
6. Media and political discourse articles are consistently in Area 6, making distinctions between media leadership (6.1), Biden-related politics (6.2), conspiracy/investigations (6.3), and culture war topics (6.4).

This completes Step 2.

    Round 5

====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions and Explanations:
1. All 74 articles (IDs 76–149) have been double‑checked to appear exactly once.
2. Articles were grouped first by their broader Area and then by the specific Topic, according to our two‑tier hierarchy.
3. I verified that similar topics (for example, all Venezuelan TPS articles) were consistently grouped, and any ambiguous assignments were reviewed.
4. The grouping is now presented in a clear, indented hierarchy without header labels on individual JSON lines.

This completes the Sorting and First Check after Step 2.

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

Revisions and Summary of Corrections:
1. I rechecked all groupings to confirm that each article (IDs 76–149) appears exactly once.
2. I verified that articles are properly nested under the correct Area and Topic, with a total of 74 records.
3. No articles were found to be missing or duplicated; only minor formatting consistency clarifications were made.

This completes the second check after Step 2.

    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete “step3.txt” file with the importance scores inserted. (In each JSON object the new key "importance" appears immediately after "title". Each Topic and Area also has an overall importance score noted in parentheses.) I carefully reviewed every record so that each article (IDs 76–149) is assigned an individual score, each Topic receives a score based on the quality and quantity of reports on that subject, and every Area’s aggregated significance is scored consistently.

Each article’s score reflects its source reliability, clarity, and perceived national or international relevance; each topic’s score weighs the concentration and significance of the reports; and every area’s overall score reflects its prominence in the current political scenario. 

This completes Step 3.

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised final “step3.txt” file with updated importance scores. (Changes are shown inline via the updated scores; note that the only substantive revision was in Area 5 – within Topic 5.1, the article from inews.co.uk (ID 141) was bumped from a score of 6 to 7, and accordingly the overall topic importance for Russia‑Ukraine Conflict was adjusted from 9 down to 8 to reflect the aggregated average more accurately. Minor re‑evaluation of several scores was performed for consistency, but no other records were changed.)

Revisions and Explanation:
1. In Topic 5.1 (Russia-Ukraine Conflict), the inews.co.uk article (ID 141) was re‑scored from an importance of 6 to 7 for better alignment with its subject matter, leading to an adjustment of the overall topic importance from 9 to 8.
2. A minor re‑evaluation of several individual article scores was performed for consistency across similar topics.
3. No articles were removed or duplicated; all original records (IDs 76–149) remain present and uniquely assigned.

This completes the first check after Step 3.

**Step 4 (logic-heavy)**

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 9
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete sorted output in one text file (step4.txt). Note that the sorting was done in three layers: first, the Areas were sorted in descending order by their importance scores (with ties preserving their original order); then, within each Area the Topics were sorted (again in descending order by importance, with ties retaining their original order); and finally, within each Topic the Articles were sorted by each article’s importance (with ties in their original order).

====================
    Round 10
    User: 
====================

**First Check After Step 4**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes and produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 10
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the updated step4.txt file after re‐evaluation. I reviewed every level—areas, topics within each area, and articles within each topic—and made two minor revisions: 

1. In Area 4, the topics were re‐ordered so that both topics with importance 8 (4.1 and 4.4) come before the ones with importance 6 (4.2 and 4.3), preserving their original order among ties.
2. In Area 7, I adjusted the ordering of topics so that Topic 7.1 (importance 7) comes first, followed by the two topics with importance 6 (Topics 7.3 and 7.4 in their original order) and then Topic 7.2 (importance 5).

All other elements remained as before. Please find the revised step4.txt below.

Explanation of revisions:
• Re‐ordered topics within Area 4 so that those with importance 8 (Topics 4.1 and 4.4, in their original order) come before topics with importance 6 (Topics 4.2 and 4.3).
• Adjusted Area 7’s topics so that Topic 7.1 (importance: 7) is first, then the topics with importance 6 (Topics 7.3 and 7.4 in their original order) and finally Topic 7.2 (importance: 5).

This completes the First Check After Step 4.


====================
    Round 11
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 11
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the new step4.txt file with updated numbering for areas and topics. I have checked that all records are included uniquely and exhaustively, and I have changed only the numbering, preserving every article’s content and order.

Revisions made in this round:
• I verified that every article record appears uniquely and exhaustively.
• I reassigned new ascending numbering for areas and their topics based solely on their order-of-appearance in the document. For instance, what was formerly “Area 2: Economic & Fiscal Policy” is now “Area 1: Economic & Fiscal Policy” and its topics were renumbered as Topic 1.1, 1.2, etc., and so on for all areas.

This completes the Second Check After Step 4 with the new numbering in step4.txt.

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Below is the step5.txt file with detailed summaries for each topic category based strictly on the news headlines:

────────────────────────────
Area 1: Economic & Fiscal Policy (importance: 8)
  Topic 1.1: Tariffs & International Trade (importance: 7)

The Trump administration's tariff policies are generating significant international and economic tensions. Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich has warned that these tariffs could signal a decline of American influence globally [76]. The international response has been sharp, with reports that Europeans are "ready to boycott iPhones" in response to Trump's tariffs [85], indicating potential commercial consequences for American companies. Financial markets appear concerned as well, with a "Sell America" sentiment returning following what's described as "a massive debt warning" [111]. The President has defended the tariffs, claiming that Americans' gas savings will offset tariff-related price increases [94], though the article questions the accuracy of this assertion. There's also concern about maritime economic impacts, with one analysis suggesting Trump's policies risk triggering a "gold rush" on the high seas [82].

  Topic 1.2: Tax Legislation & Fiscal Policy (importance: 7)

The Republican-led tax legislation is advancing with significant business-friendly provisions. According to the Wall Street Journal, businesses made substantial tax-cut requests that Republicans not only approved but expanded beyond the original asks [149]. At the same time, analysis from Common Dreams characterizes the House tax plan as "highly regressive," claiming that two-thirds of the tax cuts offered in 2027 would go to the top 20% of families, with 41% flowing to just the top 5% [105]. These fiscal developments come amid broader economic debates, with Foreign Affairs publishing a contrarian perspective titled "The Inequality Myth" that argues Western societies are actually growing more equal rather than less [97].

  Topic 1.3: Business Regulation & Corporate Activities (importance: 7)

Business regulation and corporate activities under the Trump administration face increasing scrutiny. ProPublica reports that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy sold stocks just two days before President Trump announced a plan for reciprocal tariffs [134], raising potential conflict of interest concerns. In These Times argues that despite "America First" rhetoric, the administration is prioritizing corporate interests, noting that large corporations that donated to Trump's inaugural fund are now seeing federal cases against them dropped [148]. On the environmental front, the administration reportedly plans to cancel seven conditional commitments for green projects [99]. Meanwhile, the housing sector appears less optimistic, with Newsweek reporting that builders have "bad news" for Trump's housing market [104].

  Topic 1.4: Rural & Agricultural Development (importance: 6)

Rural and agricultural policy shows tensions between rhetoric and implementation. According to South Dakota Searchlight, despite President Trump stating he "loves farmers," his administration is "dismantling the agency helping their communities survive" [130]. The report notes that approximately 10% of the 15,000 federal employees who have left the U.S. Department of Agriculture worked for Rural Development, described as "the agency most responsible for federal investment in farming communities." Meanwhile, Congress is considering legislation (H.R.3476) that would amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to require the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a forest conservation easement program [118].

Area 2: Legal Developments & Immigration (importance: 8)
  Topic 2.1: Venezuelan TPS & Deportation Policies (importance: 9)

The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a significant immigration ruling allowing the Trump administration to end deportation protections for Venezuelan migrants. Reuters reports that the Supreme Court has permitted the administration to terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for Venezuelans [131]. This decision enables the revocation of protected status for thousands of Venezuelan migrants, as reported by NBC News [117] and multiple other major news outlets [124, 125, 128, 144]. The ruling potentially clears the way for deportations of affected individuals, according to Local 10 News [142]. This represents a major shift in U.S. immigration policy toward Venezuelan nationals who had previously received protected status.

  Topic 2.2: Law Enforcement & Legal Settlements (importance: 7)

A significant legal settlement has been reached in a case related to the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot. According to the Washington Post, the U.S. government has agreed to pay nearly $5 million to the family of Ashli Babbitt, who was a participant in the Capitol riot [145]. The headline does not provide further context about the circumstances of the settlement or the specific claims that led to this outcome.

  Topic 2.3: Judicial Challenges to Administration (importance: 7)

The judiciary is delivering mixed results on administration policies and social issues. The Associated Press reports that an appeals court has "cleared the way" for President Trump's anti-union order [108], representing a victory for the administration's labor policies. In contrast, Above the Law reports that a Texas judge has overruled a Supreme Court decision related to transgender rights [84]. The provocatively headlined article suggests the judge justified the ruling based on "sincere religious belief," implying that the judge considers Supreme Court precedent optional in certain circumstances.

Area 3: Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) & Technology (importance: 8)
  Topic 3.1: DOGE Authority & Legal Challenges (importance: 8)

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has encountered legal obstacles to its authority. Wired reports that DOGE has lost a battle to take over the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) and its $500 million headquarters [135]. This aligns with NBC News' reporting that a judge has struck down DOGE's attempted takeover of the U.S. Institute of Peace [138]. These rulings represent a judicial check on the reach and authority of the newly formed department headed by Elon Musk.

  Topic 3.2: Technology Regulation & AI Policy (importance: 8)

A contentious battle is emerging over artificial intelligence regulation authority. CNN reports that House Republicans are pushing for legislation that would prevent states from regulating AI, centralizing regulatory authority at the federal level [133]. The initiative has drawn significant opposition, with more than 100 organizations pushing back against this federal preemption. This highlights growing tensions over which level of government should establish guardrails for rapidly advancing AI technologies.

  Topic 3.3: DOGE Program Cuts & Operations (importance: 6)

The Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) cost-cutting measures have come under scrutiny for their timing and potential consequences. According to Latin Times, DOGE cut several Kentucky weather forecasters just weeks before a tornado struck the region [101]. The headline implies a connection between the staffing reductions and disaster preparedness, though the full details of any impact are not specified in the headline alone.

  Topic 3.4: Elon Musk's Status & Controversies (importance: 6)

Elon Musk, head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), faces multiple controversies across business, political, and personal fronts. CNN reports that Musk's installation of "the world's biggest supercomputer" in Memphis has drawn complaints from residents who claim they're "choking on its pollution" [87]. Politically, there are signs of a significant rift with the Trump administration, with The Daily Beast reporting that "Trump World is slamming the door on Elon Musk" and quoting sources saying "people hate him" [81]. The Independent adds that Trump has removed Musk's name from Truth Social, with GOP insiders describing Musk as "finished, done gone" [95]. Musk has also generated controversy by endorsing a conspiracy theory regarding President Biden's cancer diagnosis [113]. Adding to his challenges, Kyiv Post cites a former FBI agent claiming that Russian intelligence officers targeted Musk for exploitation through "sex and drugs" [146].

Area 4: Foreign Policy & International Relations (importance: 8)
  Topic 4.1: Russia-Ukraine Conflict (importance: 8)

President Trump has intensified diplomatic efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict. NBC News reports that Trump was set to push Russian President Vladimir Putin to end what he termed the "bloodbath" in Ukraine during a high-stakes phone call [112]. Following these discussions, Bloomberg reports that Trump announced Ukraine and Russia would "start ceasefire talks immediately" [143], suggesting potential progress. However, iNews UK indicates that Trump "is getting fed up with Putin," while noting that the Russian president appears undeterred by Trump's frustration [141]. These developments mark significant movement in U.S. diplomatic engagement with the ongoing conflict.

U.S. relations with European allies show mixed developments. The Guardian reports there is "alarm" over a defense agreement that gives the United States "unhindered access" to Danish airbases [140], suggesting tensions over military cooperation arrangements. Meanwhile, U.S. diplomacy with the Vatican appears to be strengthening, with the Washington Post reporting that Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with the pope "in push to reset relations with Vatican" [83]. These contrasting developments reflect the complexities of U.S.-European relations under the Trump administration.

Middle East policy reveals tensions within and outside the administration. The New York Times reports on "the Heritage Foundation's Plan to Crush the U.S. Palestinian Movement" [96], while Democracy Now references a New York Times investigation of "Project Esther," described as a right-wing plan to "rebrand all critics of Israel as Hamas supporters" [123]. Within the administration, Axios reports that Vice President J.D. Vance "skipped Israel visit over new Israeli operation in Gaza" [86], suggesting potential disagreements over Israeli military actions. Meanwhile, Senator Jon Ossoff (D-Georgia) has criticized "Trump-supporting Republicans on Qatari free ride," according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution [139], though the specific context of this criticism is not clear from the headline alone.

A significant leadership change at a major news network appears connected to tensions with the Trump administration. Multiple outlets report that CBS News chief/president/CEO Wendy McMahon has stepped down [98, 100, 116]. The Associated Press indicates this occurred "amid potential Trump lawsuit settlement" [116], while Newsweek characterizes it as happening "after network clashes with Donald Trump" [106]. The Hill similarly reports the departure happened "amid Trump lawsuit" [100].

Political investigations and conspiracy theories have proliferated across multiple fronts. The Wall Street Journal published an opinion piece titled "A Reckoning for the Biden Coverup," arguing that "Democratic and media denial of his infirmity helped make Trump II possible" [136]. Meanwhile, The Independent reports that Donald Trump Jr. is "leading MAGA world in spreading conspiracy theories about 'coverup' of Biden's cancer diagnosis" [77]. President Trump has called for investigations into celebrity endorsements of his former opponent, with The Hill reporting Trump's demand for a "major investigation" into endorsements for Kamala Harris from Bruce Springsteen and Beyoncé after Springsteen criticized the President [107].

The Nation has published an analysis titled "The Real Reason Those White South Africans Are Here" [89], apparently examining immigration from South Africa. Techdirt asks "Where Did All Those Brave Free Speech Warriors Go?" [127], suggesting a perceived inconsistency in free speech advocacy.

Area 1: Economic & Fiscal Policy (importance: 8)
  Topic 1.1: Tariffs & International Trade (importance: 7)

The Trump administration's tariff policies are generating significant international and economic tensions. Robert Reich has warned that these tariffs could signal a decline of American influence globally [76]. The international response has been sharp, with reports that Europeans are "ready to boycott iPhones" in response to Trump's tariffs [85], indicating potential commercial consequences for American companies. Financial markets appear concerned as well, with a "Sell America" sentiment returning following what's described as "a massive debt warning" [111]. The President has defended the tariffs, claiming that Americans' gas savings will offset tariff-related price increases [94], though the article questions the accuracy of this assertion. There's also concern about maritime economic impacts, with one analysis suggesting Trump's policies risk triggering a "gold rush" on the high seas [82].

  Topic 1.2: Tax Legislation & Fiscal Policy (importance: 7)

The Republican-led tax legislation is advancing with significant business-friendly provisions. According to the Wall Street Journal, businesses made substantial tax-cut requests that Republicans not only approved but expanded beyond the original asks [149]. At the same time, analysis from Common Dreams characterizes the House tax plan as "highly regressive," claiming that two-thirds of the tax cuts offered in 2027 would go to the top 20% of families, with 41% flowing to just the top 5% [105]. These fiscal developments come amid broader economic debates, with Foreign Affairs publishing a contrarian perspective titled "The Inequality Myth" that argues Western societies are actually growing more equal rather than less [97].

Business regulation and corporate activities under the Trump administration face increasing scrutiny. ProPublica reports that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy sold stocks just two days before President Trump announced a plan for reciprocal tariffs [134], raising potential conflict of interest concerns. In These Times argues that despite "America First" rhetoric, the administration is prioritizing corporate interests, noting that large corporations that donated to Trump's inaugural fund are now seeing federal cases against them dropped [148]. On the environmental front, the administration reportedly plans to cancel seven conditional commitments for green projects [99]. Meanwhile, the housing sector appears less optimistic, with Newsweek reporting that builders have "bad news" for Trump's housing market [104].

Rural and agricultural policy shows tensions between rhetoric and implementation. According to South Dakota Searchlight, despite President Trump stating he "loves farmers," his administration is "dismantling the agency helping their communities survive" [130]. The report notes that approximately 10% of the 15,000 federal employees who have left the U.S. Department of Agriculture worked for Rural Development, described as "the agency most responsible for federal investment in farming communities." Meanwhile, Congress is considering legislation (H.R.3476) that would amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to require the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a forest conservation easement program [118].

The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a significant immigration ruling allowing the Trump administration to end deportation protections for Venezuelan migrants. Reuters reports that the Supreme Court has permitted the administration to terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for Venezuelans [131]. This decision enables the revocation of protected status for thousands of Venezuelan migrants, as reported by NBC News [117] and multiple other major news outlets [124, 125, 128, 144]. The ruling potentially clears the way for deportations of affected individuals, according to Local 10 News [142].

  Topic 2.3: Judicial Challenges to Administration (importance: 7)

The judiciary is delivering mixed results on administration policies and social issues. The Associated Press reports that an appeals court has "cleared the way" for President Trump's anti-union order [108], representing a victory for the administration's labor policies. In contrast, Above the Law, in a strongly-worded opinion headline, reports that a Texas judge has overruled a Supreme Court decision related to transgender rights [84]. The headline suggests the judge justified the ruling based on "sincere religious belief," implying that the judge considers Supreme Court precedent optional in certain circumstances.

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has encountered legal obstacles to its authority. Wired reports that DOGE has lost a battle to take over the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) and its $500 million headquarters [135].

  Topic 6.2: Local Government Issues (importance: 6)

State and local governance issues show political tensions over public safety and education funding. Fox News reports that Louisiana's governor has blasted "progressive promises" following a New Orleans jail escape, with "seven dangerous fugitives including two murder suspects" remaining at large [102]. The governor has reportedly ordered an audit of the Orleans Parish facility. In Wyoming, WyoFile reports that "despite funding cut, the show goes on for Laramie's elementary school playwrights" [114], suggesting resilience in local education programming despite resource constraints.

  Topic 6.3: Electoral Politics (importance: 6)

Electoral politics is showing signs of repositioning and internal conflicts across the political landscape. The New York Times poses the question "Is Every Top Democrat Running for President?" [122], suggesting a crowded field of potential Democratic presidential contenders for a future election. Individual lawmakers face assessment of their performance, with News BGOV reporting that "Fetterman Style Made Him Famous, but a Tough Fit for the Senate" [103], evaluating Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman's adjustment to the Senate's institutional culture. At the state level, ProPublica reports that while "Democrats Won a North Carolina Supreme Court Seat," they "Lost Control Over the Board That Sets Election Rules" [120], indicating mixed outcomes in institutional influence. Within party institutions, The Nation characterizes "The DNC's Latest Feud" as "an Exercise in Futility" [137], pointing to internal Democratic National Committee tensions.

  Topic 6.4: State Legislative Actions (importance: 5)

State legislatures are engaging in political battles over institutional influence and funding. WyoFile reports that "Wyoming lawmakers go after funding for state associations that sometimes oppose their bills" [91]. While the headline provides limited details, it suggests that Wyoming legislators are taking action against organizations that have opposed their legislative agenda, potentially affecting the funding of these state associations.

Area 7: Trump Administration & Executive Actions (importance: 4)
  Topic 7.1: Religious & Social Conservative Policies (importance: 5)

The Trump administration's approach to religious policy has drawn criticism for perceived favoritism. The Associated Press reports that "critics say Trump's religion agenda will benefit conservative Christians the most" [78]. While the headline does not specify the particular policies or critics in question, it suggests that the administration's religious initiatives are viewed by some as disproportionately advantageous to conservative Christian constituencies compared to other religious groups.

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# DAILY BRIEFING (May 2025)

## 1. Economic & Fiscal Policy

### 1.1 Tariffs & International Trade
The Trump administration's tariff policies are generating significant international tensions. Robert Reich warns these tariffs could signal declining American global influence [1], while Europeans are reportedly "ready to boycott iPhones" in response [2]. Financial markets show concern with a "Sell America" sentiment returning after what's described as "a massive debt warning" [3]. President Trump claims Americans' gas savings will offset tariff-related price increases [4], though the article questions this assertion's accuracy.

### 1.2 Tax Legislation & Fiscal Policy
Republican-led tax legislation advances with significant business-friendly provisions. According to the Wall Street Journal, businesses made substantial tax-cut requests that Republicans not only approved but expanded beyond original asks [1]. Analysis from Common Dreams characterizes the House tax plan as "highly regressive," claiming two-thirds of 2027 tax cuts would go to the top 20% of families [2]. Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs published a contrarian perspective arguing Western societies are actually growing more equal rather than less [3].

### 1.3 Business Regulation & Corporate Activities
Business regulation faces increasing scrutiny. ProPublica reports Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy sold stocks just two days before President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs [1], raising potential conflict of interest concerns. In These Times argues that despite "America First" rhetoric, the administration is prioritizing corporate interests, noting large corporations that donated to Trump's inaugural fund are seeing federal cases against them dropped [2]. The administration reportedly plans to cancel seven conditional commitments for green projects [3].

## 2. Legal Developments & Immigration

### 2.1 Venezuelan TPS & Deportation Policies
The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a significant immigration ruling allowing the Trump administration to end deportation protections for Venezuelan migrants [1]. This decision enables the revocation of protected status for thousands of Venezuelan migrants [2][3], potentially clearing the way for deportations of affected individuals [4]. This represents a major shift in U.S. immigration policy toward Venezuelan nationals who had previously received protected status.

### 2.2 Judicial Developments
According to the Washington Post, the U.S. government has agreed to pay nearly $5 million to the family of Jan. 6 Capitol riot participant Ashli Babbitt [1]. In separate developments, the Associated Press reports an appeals court has "cleared the way" for President Trump's anti-union order [2], while Above the Law reports in a strongly-worded opinion headline that a Texas judge has overruled a Supreme Court decision related to transgender rights, suggesting the judge justified the ruling based on "sincere religious belief" [3].

## 3. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) & Technology

### 3.1 DOGE Authority & Legal Challenges
The Department of Government Efficiency has encountered legal obstacles. Wired reports DOGE has lost a battle to take over the U.S. Institute of Peace and its $500 million headquarters [1], while NBC News reports a judge has struck down DOGE's attempted takeover of the institute [2]. These rulings represent a judicial check on the newly formed department headed by Elon Musk. The department's cost-cutting measures have also come under scrutiny, with Latin Times reporting DOGE cut several Kentucky weather forecasters just weeks before a tornado struck the region [3].

### 3.2 Technology Regulation & Musk Controversies
CNN reports House Republicans are pushing for legislation that would prevent states from regulating AI, centralizing regulatory authority at the federal level [1]. The initiative has drawn opposition from more than 100 organizations. Meanwhile, Elon Musk faces multiple controversies. CNN reports Musk's installation of "the world's biggest supercomputer" in Memphis has drawn pollution complaints from residents [2]. Politically, signs of a significant rift with the Trump administration have emerged, with The Daily Beast reporting "Trump World is slamming the door on Elon Musk" with sources saying "people hate him" [3]. The Independent adds that Trump has removed Musk's name from Truth Social [4].

## 4. Foreign Policy & International Relations

### 4.1 Russia-Ukraine Conflict
President Trump has intensified diplomatic efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict. NBC News reports Trump was set to push Russian President Vladimir Putin to end what he termed the "bloodbath" in Ukraine during a high-stakes phone call [1]. Following these discussions, Bloomberg reports Trump announced Ukraine and Russia would "start ceasefire talks immediately" [2]. However, iNews UK indicates Trump "is getting fed up with Putin," while noting the Russian president appears undeterred by Trump's frustration [3].

### 4.2 Global Relations
The New York Times published an article with the stark headline: "In the Future, China Will Be Dominant. The U.S. Will Be Irrelevant" [1], though the full details of this analysis are not specified in the headline. In European relations, The Guardian reports "alarm" over a defense agreement giving the United States "unhindered access" to Danish airbases [2], while the Washington Post reports Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with the pope "in push to reset relations with Vatican" [3].

### 4.3 Middle East Policy
Middle East policy reveals tensions within and outside the administration. The New York Times reports on "the Heritage Foundation's Plan to Crush the U.S. Palestinian Movement" [1], while Democracy Now references a New York Times investigation of "Project Esther," described as a right-wing plan to "rebrand all critics of Israel as Hamas supporters" [2]. Within the administration, Axios reports Vice President J.D. Vance "skipped Israel visit over new Israeli operation in Gaza" [3].

## 5. Media & Political Discourse

### 5.1 Media Leadership & Biden's Health
Multiple outlets report CBS News leadership has stepped down amid tensions with the Trump administration [1][2]. The Associated Press indicates this occurred "amid potential Trump lawsuit settlement" [3]. Meanwhile, Former President Joe Biden's cancer diagnosis has become a focus of political discourse. The New Republic cites a doctor who worked with Biden claiming he "had cancer for years" [4], while Vice President J.D. Vance has commented there was a "need to be honest" about Biden's health during his presidency [5]. Rolling Stone reports that "MAGA responds to Biden's cancer diagnosis with mockery and speculation" [6].

### 5.2 Political Investigations & Congressional Actions
The Wall Street Journal published an opinion piece titled "A Reckoning for the Biden Coverup," arguing "Democratic and media denial of his infirmity helped make Trump II possible" [1]. President Trump has called for investigations into celebrity endorsements for Kamala Harris [2]. In Congress, Republican lawmakers are advancing key pieces of the administration's agenda, though not without internal friction. NPR reports "Trump's bill" advanced "in rare weekend vote as House conservatives negotiate changes" [3], while CBS News notes "House GOP eyes tax bill vote this week as disagreements persist" [4].

### 5.3 Electoral Politics & Culture War Issues
The New York Times poses the question "Is Every Top Democrat Running for President?" [1], suggesting a crowded field of potential Democratic contenders. At the state level, ProPublica reports that while "Democrats Won a North Carolina Supreme Court Seat," they "Lost Control Over the Board That Sets Election Rules" [2]. On social issues, Bloomberg reports that "despite backlash from Trump, DEI hasn't disappeared at US companies" [3], suggesting corporate diversity programs continue despite administration opposition. The Department of Homeland Security has responded to critics, with HuffPost reporting the agency says to "stop comparing ICE to the Gestapo" [4].

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

==========Step 6 Requirements End==========


====================
    Round 16
    Assistant: 
====================

# DAILY BRIEFING (May 2025)

## 1. Economic & Fiscal Policy

### 1.1 Tariffs & International Trade
The Trump administration's tariff policies are generating significant international tensions. Robert Reich warns these tariffs could signal declining American global influence [1]. Europeans are reportedly "ready to boycott iPhones" in response to these policies [2], and financial markets show concern with a "Sell America" sentiment returning amid what's described as "a massive debt warning" [3]. President Trump has countered criticism by claiming Americans' gas savings will offset tariff-related price increases [4], though the article appears to question this assertion's accuracy.

### 1.2 Tax Legislation & Fiscal Policy
Republican-led tax legislation advances with significant business-friendly provisions. The Wall Street Journal reports businesses made substantial tax-cut requests that Republicans not only approved but expanded beyond original asks [1]. Analysis characterizes the House tax plan as "highly regressive," specifically claiming two-thirds of 2027 tax cuts would go to the top 20% of families [2]. Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs published a contrarian perspective arguing Western societies are actually growing more equal rather than less [3].

### 1.3 Business Regulation & Corporate Activities
ProPublica reports Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy sold stocks just two days before President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs [1], raising potential conflict of interest concerns. In These Times argues that despite "America First" rhetoric, the administration is prioritizing corporate interests, noting corporations that donated to Trump's inaugural fund are seeing federal cases against them dropped [2]. The administration reportedly plans to cancel seven conditional commitments for green projects [3], signaling a shift in energy policy priorities.

## 2. Legal Developments & Immigration

### 2.1 Venezuelan TPS & Deportation Policies
The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a significant immigration ruling allowing the Trump administration to end deportation protections for Venezuelan migrants [1]. This decision enables the revocation of protected status for thousands of Venezuelan nationals [2], potentially clearing the way for deportations [3]. This represents a major policy shift toward Venezuelan migrants who had previously received protected status under the Temporary Protected Status program [4].

### 2.2 Judicial Developments
The Washington Post reports the U.S. government has agreed to pay nearly $5 million to the family of Jan. 6 Capitol riot participant Ashli Babbitt [1]. In separate developments, an appeals court has "cleared the way" for President Trump's anti-union order [2], while a Texas judge has reportedly overruled a Supreme Court decision related to transgender rights, with Above the Law claiming the judge justified this ruling on the basis of "sincere religious belief" [3].

## 3. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) & Technology

### 3.1 DOGE Authority & Legal Challenges
DOGE has encountered significant legal obstacles. Wired reports the department has lost a battle to take over the U.S. Institute of Peace and its $500 million headquarters [1], while NBC News confirms a judge has struck down DOGE's attempted takeover of the institute [2]. These rulings represent a judicial check on the newly formed department headed by Elon Musk. The department's cost-cutting measures have also come under scrutiny, with Latin Times reporting DOGE cut several Kentucky weather forecasters just weeks before a tornado struck the region [3].

### 3.2 Technology Regulation & Musk Controversies
House Republicans are pushing for legislation that would prevent states from regulating AI, centralizing regulatory authority at the federal level, a move that has drawn opposition from more than 100 organizations [1]. Meanwhile, Musk faces multiple controversies. His installation of "the world's biggest supercomputer" in Memphis has drawn pollution complaints from residents [2]. Signs of a significant rift with the Trump administration have emerged, with The Daily Beast reporting "Trump World is slamming the door on Elon Musk" with sources claiming "people hate him" [3]. The Independent adds that Trump has removed Musk's name from Truth Social as GOP insiders described him as "finished, done gone" [4].

## 4. Foreign Policy & International Relations

### 4.1 Russia-Ukraine Conflict
President Trump has intensified diplomatic efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict. NBC News reports he was set to push Russian President Vladimir Putin to end what he termed the "bloodbath" in Ukraine during a high-stakes phone call [1]. Following these discussions, Bloomberg reports Trump announced Ukraine and Russia would "start ceasefire talks immediately" [2]. However, iNews UK indicates Trump "is getting fed up with Putin," while noting the Russian president appears undeterred by Trump's frustration [3].

### 4.2 Global Relations
The New York Times published an article with the stark headline: "In the Future, China Will Be Dominant. The U.S. Will Be Irrelevant" [1], though the full details of this analysis are not specified in the headline. In European relations, The Guardian reports "alarm" over a defense agreement giving the United States "unhindered access" to Danish airbases [2], while the Washington Post reports Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with the pope "in push to reset relations with Vatican" [3].

### 4.3 Middle East Policy
Middle East policy reveals tensions within and outside the administration. The New York Times reports on "the Heritage Foundation's Plan to Crush the U.S. Palestinian Movement" [1], while Democracy Now references a New York Times investigation of "Project Esther," described as a right-wing plan to "rebrand all critics of Israel as Hamas supporters" [2]. Within the administration, Axios reports Vice President J.D. Vance "skipped Israel visit over new Israeli operation in Gaza" [3], suggesting potential internal disagreements over Middle East policy.

## 5. Media & Political Discourse

### 5.1 Media Leadership Changes
CBS News leadership has stepped down amid tensions with the Trump administration. Multiple outlets report this development [1][2], with the Associated Press specifically indicating CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon quit "amid potential Trump lawsuit settlement" [3]. The specific nature of the lawsuit is not detailed in the headlines, but reporting consistently connects the leadership change to legal tensions with the President.

### 5.2 Former President Biden's Health
Former President Joe Biden's cancer diagnosis has become a focus of political discourse. The New Republic cites a doctor who worked with Biden claiming he "had cancer for years" [1]. Vice President J.D. Vance has commented there was a "need to be honest" about Biden's health during his presidency [2]. Rolling Stone reports that "MAGA responds to Biden's cancer diagnosis with mockery and speculation" [3], while Donald Trump Jr. is reportedly "leading MAGA world in spreading conspiracy theories about 'coverup' of Biden's cancer diagnosis" [4].

### 5.3 Political Investigations
President Trump has called for investigations into celebrity endorsements for Kamala Harris's 2024 campaign. The Hill reports Trump's demand for a "major investigation" into endorsements from Bruce Springsteen and Beyoncé after Springsteen criticized the President [1]. The Times (UK) also reports Trump's vows to investigate these celebrities [2]. The Wall Street Journal published an opinion piece titled "A Reckoning for the Biden Coverup," arguing "Democratic and media denial of his infirmity helped make Trump II possible" [3].

### 5.4 Congressional Actions
Republican lawmakers are advancing key pieces of the administration's agenda, though not without internal friction. NPR reports "Trump's bill" advanced "in rare weekend vote as House conservatives negotiate changes" [1], while CBS News notes "House GOP eyes tax bill vote this week as disagreements persist" [2], indicating ongoing negotiations within the Republican caucus about legislative priorities.

### 5.5 Electoral Politics & Cultural Issues
The New York Times poses the question "Is Every Top Democrat Running for President?" [1], suggesting a crowded field of potential Democratic contenders for 2028. At the state level, ProPublica reports that while "Democrats Won a North Carolina Supreme Court Seat," they "Lost Control Over the Board That Sets Election Rules" [2]. On social issues, Bloomberg reports that "despite backlash from Trump, DEI hasn't disappeared at US companies" [3], suggesting corporate diversity programs continue despite administration opposition.

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# DAILY BRIEFING (May 2025)

## 1. Economic & Fiscal Policy

### 1.1 Tariffs & International Trade
The Trump administration's tariff policies are generating significant international tensions. Robert Reich warns these tariffs could signal declining American global influence [1]. Europeans are reportedly "ready to boycott iPhones" in response to these policies [2], and financial markets show concern with a "Sell America" sentiment returning amid what's described as "a massive debt warning" [3]. President Trump has countered criticism by claiming Americans' gas savings will offset tariff-related price increases [4], though the article appears to question this assertion's accuracy.

────────────────────────────
### 1.2 Tax Legislation & Fiscal Policy
Republican-led tax legislation advances with significant business-friendly provisions. The Wall Street Journal reports businesses made substantial tax-cut requests that Republicans not only approved but expanded beyond original asks [1]. Analysis characterizes the House tax plan as "highly regressive," specifically claiming two-thirds of 2027 tax cuts would go to the top 20% of families [2]. Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs published a contrarian perspective arguing Western societies are actually growing more equal rather than less [3].

────────────────────────────
### 1.3 Business Regulation & Corporate Activities
ProPublica reports Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy sold stocks just two days before President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs [1], raising potential conflict of interest concerns. In These Times argues that despite "America First" rhetoric, the administration is prioritizing corporate interests, noting corporations that donated to Trump's inaugural fund are seeing federal cases against them dropped [2]. The administration reportedly plans to cancel seven conditional commitments for green projects [3], signaling a shift in energy policy priorities.

────────────────────────────
## 2. Legal Developments & Immigration

### 2.1 Venezuelan TPS & Deportation Policies
The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a significant immigration ruling allowing the Trump administration to end deportation protections for Venezuelan migrants [1]. This decision enables the revocation of protected status for thousands of Venezuelan nationals [2], potentially clearing the way for deportations [3]. This represents a major policy shift toward Venezuelan migrants who had previously received protected status under the Temporary Protected Status program [4].

────────────────────────────
### 2.2 Judicial Developments
The Washington Post reports the U.S. government has agreed to pay nearly $5 million to the family of Jan. 6 Capitol riot participant Ashli Babbitt [1]. In separate developments, an appeals court has "cleared the way" for President Trump's anti-union order [2], while a Texas judge has reportedly overruled a Supreme Court decision related to transgender rights, with Above the Law claiming the judge justified this ruling on the basis of "sincere religious belief" [3].

────────────────────────────
## 3. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) & Technology

### 3.1 DOGE Authority & Legal Challenges
DOGE has encountered significant legal obstacles. Wired reports the department has lost a battle to take over the U.S. Institute of Peace and its $500 million headquarters [1], while NBC News confirms a judge has struck down DOGE's attempted takeover of the institute [2]. These rulings represent a judicial check on the newly formed department headed by Elon Musk. The department's cost-cutting measures have also come under scrutiny, with Latin Times reporting DOGE cut several Kentucky weather forecasters just weeks before a tornado struck the region [3].

────────────────────────────
### 3.2 Technology Regulation & Musk Controversies
House Republicans are pushing for legislation that would prevent states from regulating AI, centralizing regulatory authority at the federal level, a move that has drawn opposition from more than 100 organizations [1]. Meanwhile, Musk faces multiple controversies. His installation of "the world's biggest supercomputer" in Memphis has drawn pollution complaints from residents [2]. Signs of a significant rift with the Trump administration have emerged, with The Daily Beast reporting "Trump World is slamming the door on Elon Musk" with sources claiming "people hate him" [3]. The Independent adds that Trump has removed Musk's name from Truth Social as GOP insiders described him as "finished, done gone" [4].

────────────────────────────
## 4. Foreign Policy & International Relations

### 4.1 Russia-Ukraine Conflict
President Trump has intensified diplomatic efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict. NBC News reports he was set to push Russian President Vladimir Putin to end what he termed the "bloodbath" in Ukraine during a high-stakes phone call [1]. Following these discussions, Bloomberg reports Trump announced Ukraine and Russia would "start ceasefire talks immediately" [2]. However, iNews UK indicates Trump "is getting fed up with Putin" [3], while noting the Russian president appears undeterred by Trump's frustration.

────────────────────────────
### 4.2 Global Relations
The New York Times published an article with the stark headline: "In the Future, China Will Be Dominant. The U.S. Will Be Irrelevant." [1] In European relations, The Guardian reports "alarm" over a defense agreement giving the United States "unhindered access" to Danish airbases [2], while the Washington Post reports Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with the pope "in push to reset relations with Vatican" [3].

────────────────────────────
### 4.3 Middle East Policy
Middle East policy reveals tensions within and outside the administration. The New York Times reports on "the Heritage Foundation's Plan to Crush the U.S. Palestinian Movement" [1], while Democracy Now references a New York Times investigation of "Project Esther," described as a right-wing plan to "rebrand all critics of Israel as Hamas supporters" [2]. Within the administration, Axios reports Vice President J.D. Vance "skipped Israel visit over new Israeli operation in Gaza" [3], suggesting potential internal disagreements over Middle East policy.

────────────────────────────
## 5. Media & Political Discourse

### 5.1 Media Leadership Changes
CBS News leadership has stepped down amid tensions with the Trump administration. Multiple outlets report this development [1][2], with the Associated Press specifically indicating CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon quit "amid potential Trump lawsuit settlement" [3]. The specific nature of the lawsuit is not detailed in the headlines, but reporting consistently connects the leadership change to legal tensions with the President.

────────────────────────────
### 5.2 Former President Biden's Health
Former President Joe Biden's cancer diagnosis has become a focus of political discourse. The New Republic cites a doctor who worked with Biden claiming he "had cancer for years" [1]. Vice President J.D. Vance has commented there was a "need to be honest" about Biden's health during his presidency [2].

# DAILY BRIEFING (May 2025)

## 1. Economic & Fiscal Policy

### 1.1 Tariffs & International Trade
The Trump administration's tariff policies are generating significant international tensions. Robert Reich warns these tariffs could signal declining American global influence [1]. Europeans are reportedly "ready to boycott iPhones" in response to these policies [2], and financial markets show concern with a "Sell America" sentiment returning amid what's described as "a massive debt warning" [3]. President Trump has countered criticism by claiming Americans' gas savings will offset tariff-related price increases [4], though the article appears to question this assertion's accuracy.

────────────────────────────
### 1.2 Tax Legislation & Fiscal Policy
Republican-led tax legislation advances with significant business-friendly provisions. The Wall Street Journal reports businesses made substantial tax-cut requests that Republicans not only approved but expanded beyond original asks [1]. Analysis characterizes the House tax plan as "highly regressive," specifically claiming two-thirds of 2027 tax cuts would go to the top 20% of families [2]. Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs published a contrarian perspective arguing Western societies are actually growing more equal rather than less [3].

### 1.3 Business Regulation & Corporate Activities
ProPublica reports Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy sold stocks just two days before President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs [1], raising potential conflict of interest concerns. In These Times argues that despite "America First" rhetoric, the administration is prioritizing corporate interests, noting corporations that donated to Trump's inaugural fund are seeing federal cases against them dropped [2]. The administration reportedly plans to cancel seven conditional commitments for green projects [3], signaling a shift in energy policy priorities.

## 2. Legal Developments & Immigration

### 2.1 Venezuelan TPS & Deportation Policies
The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a significant immigration ruling allowing the Trump administration to end deportation protections for Venezuelan migrants [1]. This decision enables the revocation of protected status for thousands of Venezuelan nationals [2], potentially clearing the way for deportations [3]. This represents a major policy shift toward Venezuelan migrants who had previously received protected status under the Temporary Protected Status program [4].

### 2.2 Judicial Developments
The Washington Post reports the U.S. government has agreed to pay nearly $5 million to the family of Jan. 6 Capitol riot participant Ashli Babbitt [1]. In separate developments, an appeals court has "cleared the way" for President Trump's anti-union order [2], while a Texas judge has reportedly overruled a Supreme Court decision related to transgender rights, with Above the Law claiming the judge justified this ruling on the basis of "sincere religious belief" [3].

────────────────────────────
## 3. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) & Technology

### 3.1 DOGE Authority & Legal Challenges
DOGE has encountered significant legal obstacles. Wired reports the department has lost a battle to take over the U.S. Institute of Peace and its $500 million headquarters [1], while NBC News confirms a judge has struck down DOGE's attempted takeover of the institute [2]. These rulings represent a judicial check on the newly formed department headed by Elon Musk. The department's cost-cutting measures have also come under scrutiny, with Latin Times reporting DOGE cut several Kentucky weather forecasters just weeks before a tornado struck the region [3].

────────────────────────────
### 3.2 Technology Regulation & Musk Controversies
House Republicans are pushing for legislation that would prevent states from regulating AI, centralizing regulatory authority at the federal level, a move that has drawn opposition from more than 100 organizations [1]. Meanwhile, Musk faces multiple controversies. His installation of "the world's biggest supercomputer" in Memphis has drawn pollution complaints from residents [2]. Signs of a significant rift with the Trump administration have emerged, with The Daily Beast reporting "Trump World is slamming the door on Elon Musk" with sources claiming "people hate him" [3]. The Independent adds that Trump has removed Musk's name from Truth Social as GOP insiders described him as "finished, done gone" [4].

────────────────────────────
## 4. Foreign Policy & International Relations

### 4.1 Russia-Ukraine Conflict
President Trump has intensified diplomatic efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict. NBC News reports he was set to push Russian President Vladimir Putin to end what he termed the "bloodbath" in Ukraine during a high-stakes phone call [1]. Following these discussions, Bloomberg reports Trump announced Ukraine and Russia would "start ceasefire talks immediately" [2]. However, iNews UK indicates Trump "is getting fed up with Putin" [3], while noting the Russian president appears undeterred by Trump's frustration.

Middle East policy reveals tensions within and outside the administration. The New York Times reports on "the Heritage Foundation's Plan to Crush the U.S. Palestinian Movement" [1], while Democracy Now references a New York Times investigation of "Project Esther," described as a right-wing plan to "rebrand all critics of Israel as Hamas supporters" [2]. Within the administration, Axios reports Vice President J.D. Vance "skipped Israel visit over new Israeli operation in Gaza" [3], suggesting potential internal disagreements over Middle East policy.

Multiple outlets report this development [1][2], with the Associated Press specifically indicating CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon quit "amid potential Trump lawsuit settlement" [3].

====================

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!
