# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Federal-State Power Dynamics

### 1.1 Legal Challenges to Federal Actions

California is mounting significant legal opposition to President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles. Governor Gavin Newsom has declared the deployment "unlawful" [1] and announced the state will file a lawsuit against the Trump administration [2][3]. This represents a direct legal confrontation between state and federal authorities over the deployment of military personnel for domestic operations. The conflict has escalated to public challenges, with Newsom explicitly daring federal officials to arrest him over his opposition to the federal actions.

### 1.2 State Rights and Sovereignty Challenges

Multiple state sovereignty disputes have emerged between states and the federal government. Governor Newsom has characterized the National Guard deployment in Los Angeles as a "breach of state sovereignty" [1]. In an economic dimension to the federal-state tensions, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has accused Newsom of threatening "tax evasion" [2]. Separately but related to state and territorial rights, disputes over voting and citizenship in U.S. territories have emerged, with their colonial history becoming a factor in these discussions [3].

## 2. International Relations

### 2.1 Russia-Ukraine Policy

President Trump has implemented a new approach to Russia's war in Ukraine that is generating criticism, with MSNBC characterizing it as potentially "his worst yet" [1]. There appears to be division among Republican lawmakers on Russia policy, with Senator Rand Paul openly criticizing Senator Lindsey Graham's advocacy for Russian sanctions, describing them as "self-defeating economic warfare" [2]. These disagreements suggest tensions within the Republican Party over the appropriate U.S. stance toward Russia and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

A major focus of enforcement actions appears to be in Los Angeles, where an immigration crackdown is underway [4].
