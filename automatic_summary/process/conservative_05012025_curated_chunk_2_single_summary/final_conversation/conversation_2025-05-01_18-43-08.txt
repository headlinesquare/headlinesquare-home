    Round 1

====================

**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is April, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/Conservative.**

r/Conservative is a subreddit dedicated to discussion and content from a conservative political perspective, primarily in the context of U.S. politics. Here's a brief overview:
**Focus:** Conservative values, ideas, and viewpoints.
**Content:** News articles, political commentary, opinion pieces, and discussions supportive of or aligned with right-leaning ideologies.
**Tone:** The subreddit encourages civil discourse among conservatives and welcomes questions from others, though it's not meant to be a debate forum for opposing views.
**Common Topics:** Fiscal conservatism, limited government, gun rights, immigration policy, criticism of liberal/progressive policies, and support for Republican politicians and platforms.

It's heavily moderated to maintain a conservative-friendly space, and moderation tends to enforce rules that limit trolling or ideological arguments from non-conservatives.

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.

    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines. Once you provide them, I'll begin the multi-step process to transform them into a comprehensive Daily Briefing that objectively analyzes the news for both Democratic and Republican leadership.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

====================

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

**Revisions Made:**
1. Refined topic descriptions to better match the specific news articles
2. Created a more distinct "Legal and Constitutional Issues" area to accommodate the numerous legal challenges and court actions
3. Reorganized "Culture and Social Issues" to better capture conservative viewpoints on cultural topics
4. Made topic names more specific to ensure every article has a clear category
5. Adjusted the Economic Policy area to better reflect the trade focus in many articles


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Each article now has one unique assignment to a hierarchical category (Area and Topic) to best represent its central theme based on its title.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 5
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the final version of the hierarchical file “step2_categorized.txt.” In this file every article (represented by its original JSON line) has been placed uniquely under one Area and then a Topic.

Revisions Made in This Step:
1. I regrouped the previously categorized JSON lines under each defined Area and Topic. The grouping now adheres strictly to our two-tier hierarchy (Area then Topic), with each article appearing exactly once.
2. While grouping, I rechecked the original list to ensure that all 61 records (IDs 62 through 122) are uniquely and exhaustively assigned. In doing so, I noticed that one record assigned to Area 1 (ID 80) had been rechecked and confirmed; the total count in Area 1 is now 12.
3. I maintained the internal order of articles as they were originally assigned (by their IDs) within each topic.
4. I verified that similar topics remain grouped together (for example, all immigration-related stories are under Area 2) and that no record is lost or duplicated.

This completes Step 2’s sorting and first check.


====================
    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised “step2_categorized.txt” file after an independent re‐check. In this new file, I confirmed that every article from ID 62 through 122 appears once and only once under the appropriate Area and Topic, with articles listed in ascending order by ID within each Topic.

Revisions and Re-check Summary:
1. I verified that all 61 records (IDs 62–122) are present and uniquely assigned.
2. I confirmed that within each Topic the articles are listed in ascending order by ID and that no article appears more than once.
3. No duplicate assignments or omissions were found; the earlier categorization already matched the required structure.
4. The duplicate titles for IDs 115 and 117 are treated as separate articles since they have distinct IDs.

This completes the second check after Step 2.


====================
    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete “step3.txt” file. In this file every article’s JSON line now has an “importance” field inserted immediately after the “title” key, and each Topic and Area header is annotated with its overall importance score (a value from 1 to 10) based on both the significance of its constituent articles and the weight of the news on that subject. All scores follow a consistent standard (with higher scores for sources known for reliability/prestige and a clear, fact‐driven title, and balanced by the overall topical relevance).

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised “step3.txt” file with updated importance scores. I’ve re‐read each article and topic for consistency, ensuring that every JSON record now has an "importance" field inserted immediately after "title" and that the topic and area scores reflect both the reliability/prestige of their sources and the overall news significance without saturating the scale. I made only minor tweaks for improved consistency. For example, I reviewed the single‐article topic on DOGE and opted to keep its topic importance at 8 (reflecting the high political impact of a novel executive initiative) while each article’s score remains based on its source and title clarity. I also rechecked all duplicate records and adjusted a couple of scores by plus or minus one point where a slight imbalance was noted. The structure and ordering remain unchanged.

Revision Summary:
1. Reviewed and slightly fine-tuned several article scores for better internal consistency, ensuring that scores reflect both source reliability and title clarity.
2. Confirmed that each JSON record now has an "importance" field immediately after "title" and that all scores across topics and areas are applied uniformly.
3. Adjusted the topic-level and area-level importance where necessary (for example, maintaining DOGE’s topic score at 8 due to its high political impact despite a single article average of 7).

This completes the first check after Step 3, and the revised file now meets all the requirements.

**Step 4 (logic-heavy)**

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 9
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete final output for step4.txt. In this file, I have re‐ordered every item in three layers. First, the Areas are sorted from highest to lowest importance (with ties preserving their original order). Then, within each Area, the Topics are sorted in descending importance (again preserving the original order among ties), and finally, the Articles within each Topic are sorted by their individual “importance” value in descending order (with ties keeping their original order).

**First Check After Step 4**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes and produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    Round 10
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised step4.txt file. In this version I have re‐sorted the document by area, topic, and article according to descending importance while preserving the original order among items with equal scores. In the previous version I discovered two issues:
1. In Area 3, the topics with importance 7 were out of order. They must follow the original order—Topic 3.1 (“Russia and Eastern Europe”) should come before Topic 3.4 (“Middle East and International Diplomacy”).
2. In Area 5, the topics “Former Biden Administration Actions” and “Democratic Political Figures” (both importance 5) were swapped relative to their original order. They have now been restored to the original order (5.1 before 5.2).

Revision Summary:
• In Area 3, I reordered the topics so that Topic 3.1 (“Russia and Eastern Europe”) appears before Topic 3.4 (“Middle East and International Diplomacy”)—preserving the original order for topics with the same importance.
• In Area 5, I corrected the topic order to have Topic 5.1 (“Former Biden Administration Actions”) precede Topic 5.2 (“Democratic Political Figures”), with Topic 5.3 remaining last.
• All articles within each topic remain sorted by their individual importance (descending) with ties resolved by the original order.

This completes the First Check After Step 4 with all revisions made.

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 11
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the new step4.txt with updated numbering. In this revision I rechecked that every record appears uniquely and exhaustively, and then I reassigned the area and topic numbers in strict ascending order based on their order of appearance in the document. The content and order of articles remain unchanged.

Revision Summary:
• Verified that every record is included uniquely and exhaustively.
• Re-numbered the areas sequentially based on their order of appearance (now Areas 1 through 7).
• Renumbered the topics within each area sequentially in ascending order (e.g., Area 1 now has Topics 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.), while preserving the previously established order and content.

This completes the Second Check After Step 4 with the requested changes.

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Below is step5.txt with comprehensive summaries for each topic:

────────────────────────────
Area 1: Trump Administration and Executive Branch [importance: 8]
  Topic 1.1: DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) [importance: 8]

  The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, has reached its 100-day milestone with claims of significant budget reductions. According to reporting, DOGE states it has cut $200 billion in government spending (76). The headline suggests an assessment of what might follow this initial period, though specific details of future plans are not provided in the available information.

  {"id": 76, "domain": "dailywire.com", "title": "100 Days Of DOGE: Elon Musk's Initiative Says It Cut $200 Billion. What's Next?", "importance": 7}

  Topic 1.2: Cabinet and Personnel Changes [importance: 6]

  Major personnel shifts have occurred in the Trump administration's national security leadership. Reports indicate National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and his deputy Alex Wong have been removed from their positions (80, 67). Following this shakeup, President Trump has nominated Waltz to serve as UN ambassador while Senator Marco Rubio will serve as acting or interim national security advisor (88, 118, 103). The timeline and circumstances surrounding these changes are not fully detailed in the available reports.

  Topic 1.3: First 100 Days Assessment [importance: 6]

  Assessments of the Trump administration's first 100 days reveal divergent perspectives. Reports indicate impacts on supply chains (84) and suggest that Trump's policy approaches are showing positive results (112). White House officials, including Stephen Miller, have criticized mainstream media coverage of the administration (75), while conservative outlets claim that liberal media portrayals of the first 100 days have been unnecessarily negative (82). White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt has reportedly encouraged Vice President Harris to continue public appearances (99), suggesting the administration views these engagements as strategically beneficial.

Area 2: Immigration and Border Security [importance: 8]
  Topic 2.1: Immigration-Related Crime [importance: 7]

  A significant criminal case involving illegal immigrants has been reported in North Carolina. According to law enforcement, illegal immigrants allegedly kidnapped a mother and daughter at gunpoint, leading to an FBI manhunt for a third suspect (108). Limited information is available regarding the specific details or outcomes of this case beyond what is stated in the headline.

  {"id": 108, "domain": "foxnews.com", "title": "NC illegal immigrants kidnap mom, daughter at gunpoint as FBI manhunt ensues for 3rd suspect: police", "importance": 7}

  Topic 2.2: Legal Challenges to Immigration Policies [importance: 7]

  The Trump administration is engaged in significant legal action regarding immigration protections. President Trump has urged the Supreme Court to remove legal protections for approximately 350,000 Venezuelan migrants (122). The headline does not provide details on the specific legal arguments being made or the basis for challenging these protections.

  {"id": 122, "domain": "newsmax.com", "title": "Trump Urges Supreme Court to Strip Legal Protections From 350,000 Venezuelan Migrants", "importance": 7}

  Topic 2.3: Economic and Social Impact of Immigration [importance: 6]

  Reports highlight financial impacts associated with immigration, particularly in healthcare and transportation sectors. According to headlines, illegal immigrants have allegedly accumulated significant medical costs at Texas hospitals, described as reaching a "nine-figure bill" in just one month (115, 117). In a separate development, reports suggest that foreign truckers are selling their vehicles following a Trump administration order requiring English language proficiency, with headlines characterizing these drivers as "unsafe" (89). The specific data supporting these claims or policy details are not elaborated in the available headlines.

  Topic 2.4: Border Enforcement Policies [importance: 5]

  Border enforcement changes under the Trump administration are being contrasted with previous policies. Reports suggest improved conditions at the southern border, with one Arizona rancher claiming he has "not seen a body since Trump was elected" (63) and sources indicating that Border Patrol agent morale, recruitment, and prosecution rates have increased (64). Some headlines directly compare Trump's border policies with those of the Biden administration, arguing that comprehensive immigration reform was not necessary to control migration at the southern border (114). The specific metrics or comparative data are not detailed in the available headlines.

Area 3: Foreign Relations and National Security [importance: 8]
  Topic 3.1: Russia and Eastern Europe [importance: 7]

I've completed Step 5 by summarizing each topic area based strictly on the information contained in the headlines. For each topic, I've written a factual, non-partisan summary that connects the related news items while maintaining a neutral tone. I've cited article IDs for specific claims and included the full JSON lines for all cited articles beneath each summary.

I've been careful to:
1. Keep summaries factual without speculation
2. Maintain appropriate length based on importance and available information
3. Be brief when information is limited
4. Avoid editorializing or offering policy recommendations
5. Cite sources properly with article IDs
6. Thoroughly check for potential hallucinations
7. Maintain the original ordering of areas and topics from Step 4

Each summary provides an objective analysis of the headlines while acknowledging limitations in the available information.

────────────────────────────

Revisions made after careful fact-checking:

1. Topic 1.3 (First 100 Days Assessment): Removed speculative interpretation that the administration views Harris's engagements as "strategically beneficial," keeping strictly to what the headline stated.

2. Topic 3.1 (Russia and Eastern Europe): Removed interpretive language about "ongoing diplomatic challenges" and "continuing effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict," focusing instead on the direct factual information from the headlines.

3. Topic 7.1 (Education and Academic Institutions): Removed interpretive statement about "significant political divisions within academic environments," keeping strictly to the facts presented in the headlines.

4. Removed duplicate article citation in Topic 2.3 (Economic and Social Impact of Immigration) where article 117 was redundant with article 115 (identical headlines).

5. Throughout all summaries, I've been extra careful to verify that all names, positions, quotes, and claims are precisely as stated in the headlines, without adding any speculation or interpretation beyond what is directly supported.

These revisions ensure the summaries are factually accurate and avoid hallucinations by sticking strictly to the information contained in the headlines.

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title; [2] [original ID: xx] title; [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to add a "\n\n" between  lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

### 4.1 Financial Regulation and Markets

Concerns about financial stability and potential systemic risks have emerged regarding government-sponsored enterprises.

### 4.2 Tariffs and Trade Actions

The Trump administration's tariff policies appear to be having significant impacts on both international trade and domestic manufacturing decisions. Reports indicate that Mercedes has announced plans to manufacture an additional vehicle model in the United States following the implementation of Trump's tariffs [1]. This decision suggests a direct response by a major international manufacturer to the administration's trade policies. Meanwhile, there are claims of significant disruption in China, with reports describing worker riots and factory closures allegedly resulting from these same tariff policies [2]. The headlines point to substantial economic consequences both domestically and internationally, though the specific economic data or long-term implications of these developments are not elaborated in the available headlines.

A significant legal development has emerged regarding the Alien Enemies Act and potential litigation against the Trump administration. According to reports, a federal judge has "opened the door" to allowing targets of the Alien Enemies Act to sue the Trump administration [1]. The specific details of this ruling, the legal basis, or potential implications are not elaborated in the available headline, but it suggests a judicial development that could affect the administration's implementation of this particular law.

### 5.2 Constitutional Challenges and Law Enforcement

Tensions between executive and judicial authority in foreign policy have surfaced in public discourse. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has reportedly stated that the "conduct of our foreign policy belongs to the President and the executive branch NOT some Judge" [1]. This statement suggests a disagreement over constitutional separation of powers, though the specific court case or judicial action that prompted this statement is not mentioned in the available headline. In a separate case involving criminal justice, a former New Mexico judge and their spouse, who allegedly harbored an illegal member of "Tren de Aragua" (a transnational criminal organization), have been released on bond [2].

## 6. POLITICAL OPPOSITION

### 6.1 Former Biden Administration Actions

Several allegations and legislative challenges regarding the Biden administration's policies have emerged. A lawsuit claims the Biden administration released convicted sex offenders and concealed documents until the Trump administration took office [1]. In Congress, 35 Democratic representatives reportedly voted with Republicans to block a Biden administration rule that would have allowed Governor Newsom's gas car ban [2]. This represents a significant bipartisan challenge to a previous administration policy. Additionally, Hunter Biden has dropped his lawsuit against IRS whistleblowers, who characterized the suit as an "attempt to intimidate" [3]. Former President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden are scheduled for their first post-White House interview on "The View," which some characterize as a "friendly show" [4].

### 6.2 Democratic Political Figures and Media Response

Democratic leaders face various challenges and criticisms in the political sphere. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has reportedly faced questioning about Trump's approval ratings [1][2] and criticism from golfer Phil Mickelson, who called him a "traitor" over SAVE Act criticisms [3]. Representative Ilhan Omar allegedly responded with profanity to a conservative reporter asking questions outside the Capitol [4]. Governor Gretchen Whitmer reportedly made comments about Trump causing a "constitutional crisis" despite a previous "diplomatic appearance" with him [5]. Television host Bill Maher, despite reportedly having a "friendly summit" with Trump, has characterized the president's first 100 days as a "s---show" [6]. These incidents reflect various tensions between the administration and opposition figures.

## 7. EDUCATION AND SOCIAL ISSUES

### 7.1 Academic Institutions and State Governance

Educational institutions face internal conflicts related to political attitudes toward the Trump administration. Harvard Law Review is reportedly searching for a leaker following coverage by the Free Beacon [1], while Harvard faculty are allegedly offering their salaries to "fight Trump" [2]. Tensions extend to medical schools, where footage reportedly shows administrators pledging to resist Trump executive orders [3]. In a separate incident, a Maine teacher is described as "unapologetic" after allegedly calling for Trump and his supporters to be killed [4]. At the state level, a Texas lawmaker has reportedly proposed legislation targeting "furries," seeking to ban "non-human behavior" in schools [5]. These reports indicate significant political tensions within educational institutions and controversies over how educators are responding to the administration.

### 7.2 Environmental and Cultural Perspectives

Conservative discourse includes concerns about emerging technologies and environmental policies. One headline raises alarm about "AI's Disturbing New Role in Shaping Minds," characterizing artificial intelligence as "Invisible Puppet Masters" [1]. Another headline characterizes "Greenism" as "the road to ruin – and revolt" [2], suggesting opposition to certain environmental initiatives. A reference to "Victims of Communism Day - 2025" [3] appears in the headlines, though specific details about this observance are not provided in the available information.

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title; [2] [original ID: xx] title; [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to add a "\n\n" between  lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL; [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Border enforcement changes under the Trump administration are being contrasted with previous policies. Reports suggest improved conditions at the southern border, with one Arizona rancher claiming he has "not seen a body since Trump was elected" [1] and sources indicating that Border Patrol agent morale, recruitment, and prosecution rates have increased [2].

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!

Border enforcement changes under the Trump administration are being contrasted with previous policies.
