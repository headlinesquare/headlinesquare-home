Please critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks provided below. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You must use your limited length to summarize the most important news, while skipping the secondary.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.

Please carefully think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. **You will do the merging task in the next round with my detailed instructions. Please do not attempt to write down your summary at this step, because you haven't been given the full instructions yet!** It is always better to take some time to think clearly for such a difficult task, and make detailed plans for yourself, before taking any actions. You should use this opportunity to prepare yourself for your next round of work by writing down some notes for yourself.
