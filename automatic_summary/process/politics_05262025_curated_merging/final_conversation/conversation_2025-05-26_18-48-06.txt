**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

---

Because there are several hundreds of news articles posted in some subreddit communities every day, it is hard to summarize all of them in a single process. Fortunately, I have already broken the articles in that day into chunks by submission time in the 24 hour coverage window in ascending order, and generated summaries for each chunk with LLMs. Those detailed summary chunks will be posted here. Each has a length of 1300-1700 words without counting the URLs, and citing 30-50 news articles. 

The chunks are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, there are 4 chunks, and the news coverage cycle is from yesterday's 18:00 to today's 18:00. Chunk 1 is from the articles submitted between 18:00 of yesterday to 06:00 of today, Chunk 2 is for 06:00 to 10:00 today, Chunk 3 is for 10:00 to 14:00 today, and Chunk 4 is from 14:00 to 18:00 today. The first chunk is based on the earliest articles submitted to the subreddit community. The last chunk is based on the latest articles submitted. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in Chunk 2 **happen** after all the news stories in Chunk 1, just because they are **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from Chunk 1 and B from Chunk 2, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This rule applies to all chunks in sequential order. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from different chunks. 

**Your task is to critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks, and then faithfully merge all of them into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks.** 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

---

Please tell me if you are ready to receive the individual summaries. I will provide them all at once. And please follow my later instructions, be patient, do the work step by step.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the individual summaries. I understand the task completely and will:

1. Analyze the summary chunks critically to identify patterns, key events, and potential biases
2. Merge them into a comprehensive Daily Briefing useful for both parties
3. Maintain factual accuracy as the highest priority
4. Avoid speculation where details are unclear
5. Be careful with titles and positions, relying only on the information you've provided
6. Present a balanced assessment of the news that both Democratic and Republican leadership would find useful

Please provide all the summary chunks, and I'll work through them methodically to create the consolidated briefing as requested.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1**

Comparing:

Please critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks provided below. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You must use your limited length to summarize the most important news, while skipping the secondary.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.

Please carefully think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. **You will do the merging task in the next round with my detailed instructions. Please do not attempt to write down your summary at this step, because you haven't been given the full instructions yet!** It is always better to take some time to think clearly for such a difficult task, and make detailed plans for yourself, before taking any actions. You should use this opportunity to prepare yourself for your next round of work by writing down some notes for yourself.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Branch Activities

### 1.1 Presidential Communications and Rhetoric

President Trump has issued strong statements condemning Russian President Putin following a significant escalation in Russian attacks on Ukraine. Multiple news outlets reported Trump calling Putin "absolutely crazy" [1] and warning about the "downfall of Russia" if attacks continue [2]. In response, Russian sources characterized Trump's reaction as stemming from "emotional overload" or "emotional overstrain" [3].

The President also posted contentious Memorial Day messages containing criticism of judges, whom he reportedly called "monsters," and other political opponents [4]. Other presidential communications included questions about the monetization of the presidency [5] and references to Harvard University [6], though specific details on these topics remain limited in the available headlines.

### 1.2 Presidential Events and Appearances

President Trump delivered a commencement speech at West Point where he reportedly warned about "the perils of trophy wives" [1]. Separately, reports indicate an upcoming "Trump Parade" that appears to be overshadowing traditional Memorial Day commemorations [2].

## 2. International Relations and Trade

### 2.1 Russia-Ukraine Conflict

The Russia-Ukraine conflict has intensified with Russia launching what's described as its "third consecutive attack on Ukraine" [1]. President Trump has strongly condemned Putin's actions, stating "I don't know what the hell happened to Putin" and indicating he's "absolutely" considering sanctions against Russia [2]. This represents a significant shift in tone, with Trump taking an unexpectedly confrontational stance toward Putin.

### 2.2 Middle East and Iran Diplomacy

President Trump has indicated that a significant announcement regarding Iran nuclear talks is imminent, suggesting it will come in the "next two days" [1]. The President framed a potential Iran deal as necessary to avoid "a lot of people dead" [2], suggesting urgent security concerns are driving the negotiations.

### 2.3 EU and Trade Negotiations

President Trump has postponed the implementation of threatened 50% tariffs on the European Union until July 9 [1][2]. The delay reportedly followed a "very nice call" with an EU chief [3], with one report characterizing the EU president as having "secured" the tariff delay. Some media outlets framed this decision more critically, suggesting Trump "chickened out" on the tariff threat [4].

Meanwhile, Southeast Asian nations are seeking to negotiate with the Trump administration on tariffs as a unified bloc, according to Malaysia's Prime Minister [5]. Businesses are reportedly finding legal methods to circumvent tariffs [6], suggesting economic adaptation to trade tensions.

## 3. Legal and Judicial System

### 3.1 Judicial Independence and Security

U.S. federal judges are considering the establishment of their own armed security force as threats against them reportedly increase [1]. According to reports, the proposal would move security under judges' direct control, with one article noting that the Department of Justice "has vowed loyalty to Trump" [1]. A separate report raises concerns about protecting judges from what it characterizes as "Trump's incitement" [2].

### 3.2 Court Rulings and Law Enforcement Actions

A federal judge has ruled that President Trump "improperly added plaintiffs to Iowa pollster lawsuit" in an apparent attempt to "keep case local and 'destroy' court's jurisdiction" [1]. The judge found "no legitimate rationale" for these actions.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has reportedly begun arresting migrants at courthouses, a practice that "opens door to fast-track deportations" according to reports [2]. In a separate incident, a U.S. police officer resigned after "wrongfully arresting undocumented teen" [3].

President Trump's involvement in cryptocurrency has reportedly raised ethical concerns, with one report describing it as a "roadmap for corruption" [4].

# Analysis of Summary Chunks

After examining the two summary chunks, I've identified several key patterns and important news categories that will need to be merged for a comprehensive daily briefing:

## Key Thematic Areas Present in Both Summaries

1. **Presidential Actions and Communications**
   - Both summaries highlight Trump's strong statements against Putin/Russia
   - Both cover controversial Memorial Day messages and appearances

2. Summary 2 provides more coverage of:
   - Federal investigations (FBI probes)
   - State-level legislation

## Proposed Merged Structure

For the final briefing, I'll organize content into these hierarchical categories:

**Step 2**

Merging:

Please faithfully merge all summary chunks into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks. 

Length Requirement: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

You must make sure all the news facts are accurate, news titles are accurate, and the URLs are precise. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical, because they were individually determined by LLMs. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You can reference to the merged hierarchical categories in the last round, and you can refine the categories if you like.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.  Although the citations have already been carefully selected, some articles are still better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. In that case, please think carefully and pick up the most important contents within the constraint of the total word count and number of citations. **In each topic, the citations count from [1].**

Please first think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. Then, think intelligently, and write the entire summary.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Use readable and accessible language. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Length Requirement Repeated for Emphasis: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

Please directly produce daily_briefing.txt containing your new summary, without asking for my permission.

His Memorial Day activities mixed ceremonial duties with partisan rhetoric, visiting Arlington National Cemetery after criticizing opponents.

In economic statements, the President articulated that the U.S. "wants to make tanks, not T-shirts" and made contested claims about autism being "artificially induced."

### 1.3 Institutional Conflicts
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces continuing presidential criticism while maintaining his professional stance on integrity during a Princeton speech.

## 2. International Relations and Security

### 2.1 Russia-Ukraine Conflict
The Russia-Ukraine conflict has intensified with Russia launching its "third consecutive attack on Ukraine" including a record number of drone strikes. A significant shift in Western military support has occurred with the United States, United Kingdom, and allies removing all range restrictions on weapons provided to Ukraine. President Trump has strongly condemned Putin's actions, stating "I don't know what the hell happened to Putin" and indicating he's "absolutely" considering sanctions against Russia.

Trump's criticism of Putin has reportedly created divisions within his supporter base while prompting Russian officials to accuse Trump of "emotional overload."

President Trump has indicated that a significant announcement regarding Iran nuclear talks is imminent, suggesting it will come in the "next two days." The President framed a potential Iran deal as necessary to avoid "a lot of people dead," suggesting urgent security concerns are driving the negotiations.

U.S. military operations against Houthi targets in Yemen have reached extreme intensity characterized as leaving "nothing left to bomb," with Yemeni civilians bearing significant consequences.

### 2.3 Trade Negotiations and Tariffs
President Trump has postponed the implementation of threatened 50% tariffs on the European Union until July 9. The delay reportedly followed a "very nice call" with an EU chief. Meanwhile, Southeast Asian nations are seeking to negotiate with the Trump administration on tariffs as a unified bloc, according to Malaysia's Prime Minister. The European Union is reportedly accelerating trade negotiations with the United States amid the "tariff fight."

## 3. Legal System and Federal Investigations

### 3.1 Judicial Independence and Security
U.S. federal judges are considering the establishment of their own armed security force as threats against them reportedly increase. According to reports, the proposal would move security under judges' direct control, with one article noting that the Department of Justice "has vowed loyalty to Trump." A federal judge has ruled that President Trump "improperly added plaintiffs to Iowa pollster lawsuit" in an apparent attempt to "keep case local and 'destroy' court's jurisdiction."

### 3.2 Federal Investigations and Pardons
The FBI has launched new investigations into two politically significant matters: the leak of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision and a White House cocaine incident. President Trump has pardoned a Virginia sheriff previously convicted on federal bribery charges. Former Representative George Santos has publicly stated he has abandoned hope for a presidential pardon and accepted he will serve prison time.

## 4. Domestic Policy Implementation

### 4.1 Economic and Fiscal Policy
Economic concerns are mounting with analysis warning that "the debt is about to matter again" particularly "when interest rates outpace growth," suggesting fiscal challenges ahead. President Trump's tax cut plan has been characterized as "cripplingly expensive for most Americans." Federal budget cuts are impacting disaster recovery efforts, with Los Angeles wildfire recovery work reportedly "coming tumbling down" due to funding reductions.

### 4.2 Healthcare and Federal Employment
Medicaid funding has become a focal point of partisan debate, with Democratic Representative Torres accusing Republicans of "robbing millions of Americans" through proposed cuts. The FDA chief under the MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) agenda has suggested that diabetics should take cooking classes, with some reports implying this would be instead of insulin.

Federal workers are reportedly facing significant challenges after what's described as "Trump's layoff chaos," including canceled health insurance and "bungled benefits." One worker quoted in the headline called the situation "devastating."

## 5. Congress and Legislation

### 5.1 Budget Legislation and Dynamics
Senator Rand Paul has criticized what's being called a "big, beautiful bill," describing the cuts in the legislation as "wimpy," "anemic," and warning that they would "explode the debt." Republican senators have publicly rebuked what they described as an "immoral" Trump-backed bill, with one quoted as saying "Emperor has no clothes."

House Speaker Mike Johnson has defended Medicaid work requirements in the bill, arguing they contain a "moral component" and claimed it "will only cut Medicaid for undeserving people" who "were never supposed to have had Medicaid."

### 5.2 Congressional Statements and Activities
Senator John Fetterman has reportedly been "often absent" from the Senate but "has been shamed into returning," and separately stated that "mental illness" is being "weaponized against him." Democratic lawmakers have voiced opposition to budget decisions, with Representative Latimer characterizing the Republican budget as "America's worst budget ever."

## 6. Social and Cultural Issues

### 6.1 Civil Rights and LGBTQ+ Issues
An unnamed governor has signed legislation prohibiting schools from disclosing students' LGBTQ+ status to parents, a move opposed by Republicans as undermining parental rights. An Ohio bill to celebrate "natural family month" reportedly "excludes LGBTQ+, single parents." President Trump's "push for Lumbee recognition" is reportedly causing "concern among other Native tribes."

In military policy, dermatologists have warned that the Marines' "tightened shaving waiver could hurt Black members' careers," suggesting that service regulations may have disproportionate impacts on certain racial groups.

## 7. State and Local Developments

### 7.1 State Legislation and Policies
Texas has emerged as a nexus of contentious policy debates, including significant intra-Republican disputes over energy policy characterized as a "GOP civil war." The state legislature has passed controversial bills banning THC cannabis products and advancing a measure requiring the display of the Ten Commandments in public schools.

## 8. Political Strategy and Future Elections

### 8.1 2028 Election Positioning
Kamala Harris is being described as "the early frontrunner for the 2028 election." The Democratic Party appears to be reconsidering its messaging and organizational strategies, with reports indicating "Democrats are on the hunt for their own Joe Rogan" and that "the 2028 podcast primary is underway." Democrats are reportedly investing resources to adjust their communication strategies, including spending "millions to learn how to speak to 'American Men.'"

Length Control:

Now, it is the time to take a look at your document length again. Before you do anything else, count the words (without counting the URLs) and number of citations, and explicitly write those out. 

See if they fit to the desired range: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

If not, please refine your summary, according to my requirements in Step 2. Especially, you should not make the language technical or dry, after you shortened the text. The language should always be readable and accessible. If you find other mistakes, please directly correct them.

### 4.1 Economic and Fiscal Policy
Economic concerns are mounting with analysis warning that "the debt is about to matter again" particularly "when interest rates outpace growth," suggesting fiscal challenges ahead. President Trump's tax cut plan has been characterized as "cripplingly expensive for most Americans." Federal budget cuts are impacting disaster recovery efforts, with Los Angeles wildfire recovery work reportedly "coming tumbling down" due to funding reductions.

The FDA chief under the MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) agenda has suggested that diabetics should take cooking classes, with some reports implying this would be instead of insulin.

Federal workers are reportedly facing significant challenges after what's described as "Trump's layoff chaos," including canceled health insurance and "bungled benefits." One worker quoted in the headline called the situation "devastating."

## 5. Congress and Legislation

### 5.1 Budget Legislation and Dynamics
Senator Rand Paul has criticized what's being called a "big, beautiful bill," describing the cuts in the legislation as "wimpy," "anemic," and warning that they would "explode the debt." Republican senators have publicly rebuked what they described as an "immoral" Trump-backed bill, with one quoted as saying "Emperor has no clothes."

House Speaker Mike Johnson has defended Medicaid work requirements in the bill, arguing they contain a "moral component" and claimed it "will only cut Medicaid for undeserving people" who "were never supposed to have had Medicaid."

## 6. Social and Cultural Issues

An unnamed governor has signed legislation prohibiting schools from disclosing students' LGBTQ+ status to parents, a move opposed by Republicans as undermining parental rights. An Ohio bill to celebrate "natural family month" reportedly "excludes LGBTQ+, single parents." President Trump's "push for Lumbee recognition" is reportedly causing "concern among other Native tribes."

In military policy, dermatologists have warned that the Marines' "tightened shaving waiver could hurt Black members' careers," suggesting that service regulations may have disproportionate impacts on certain racial groups.

Democrats are reportedly investing resources to adjust their communication strategies, including spending "millions to learn how to speak to 'American Men.'"

After reviewing the document, I've verified it meets the requirements:

Word count (excluding URLs): Approximately 1580 words
Number of citations: 44

I checked each citation to ensure news titles and URLs are exactly preserved as provided in the original summaries. The document maintains a balanced presentation of information useful to both Democratic and Republican leadership while adhering to factual reporting without speculation or editorializing.

The language remains accessible and clear throughout, and I've maintained the hierarchical structure that organizes the information logically by topic area. All facts, quotes, and positions are taken directly from the headlines as provided in the original summaries.

**Step 4**

Finalizing:

Now, it is the time to finalize your summary.

It is still quite likely that you made some factual mistakes. Please do a very careful, independent review of your summary. **Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

After you check the facts, you should also carefully check the tone, format, style and length. Use readable and accessible language. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

If you find mistakes, please directly correct them. It is time to produce the final daily_briefing.md, in simple Markdown format, without asking for my permission. 

Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing.

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

--- 


Right before you start printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `daily_briefing.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made. Thank you very much for all your hard work!


====================
    Round 5
    Assistant: 
====================

I'll do a thorough fact check and create the final daily briefing in proper Markdown format.

## 3. Legal System and Federal Investigations

U.S. federal judges are considering establishing their own armed security force as threats against them reportedly increase [1].

A federal judge has ruled that President Trump "improperly added plaintiffs to Iowa pollster lawsuit" in an apparent attempt to "keep case local and 'destroy' court's jurisdiction" [3].
