**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/Conservative.**

r/Conservative is a subreddit dedicated to discussion and content from a conservative political perspective, primarily in the context of U.S. politics. Here's a brief overview:
**Focus:** Conservative values, ideas, and viewpoints.
**Content:** News articles, political commentary, opinion pieces, and discussions supportive of or aligned with right-leaning ideologies.
**Tone:** The subreddit encourages civil discourse among conservatives and welcomes questions from others, though it's not meant to be a debate forum for opposing views.
**Common Topics:** Fiscal conservatism, limited government, gun rights, immigration policy, criticism of liberal/progressive policies, and support for Republican politicians and platforms.

It's heavily moderated to maintain a conservative-friendly space, and moderation tends to enforce rules that limit trolling or ideological arguments from non-conservatives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines for today's news feed from r/Conservative. Once I have the complete set of news items, I'll begin the systematic analysis process following the 8-step workflow you've outlined.

I understand that I'm acting as Chief News Analyst preparing a Daily Briefing for both Democratic and Republican congressional leadership in the May 2025 context you've described. I'll analyze the news items based solely on the information provided, maintaining factual accuracy as the highest priority and avoiding speculation where details are unclear.

Please provide the JSONL lines, and I'll begin with Step 1 after receiving them.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

====================

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

    Round 3

# step1.txt

Area 1: Trump Administration Policies and Actions
    Topic 1.1: Executive Orders and Policy Implementation
    Topic 1.2: Administration Personnel and White House Operations
    Topic 1.3: Legislative Priorities and Congressional Relations
    Topic 1.4: Government Services and Agency Management

Area 2: Biden Administration Legacy and Democratic Opposition
    Topic 2.1: Biden Fitness and White House Operations Revelations
    Topic 2.2: Democratic Party Strategy and Leadership
    Topic 2.3: Criticism of Biden-Era Policies
    Topic 2.4: Democratic Politicians and Ethics Concerns

Area 3: Economic and Regulatory Policy
    Topic 3.1: Energy Policy and Environmental Regulations
    Topic 3.2: Government Spending and Entitlement Programs
    Topic 3.3: Business Regulations and Corporate Response
    Topic 3.4: Economic Forecasts and Analysis

Area 4: Immigration and Border Security
    Topic 4.1: Border Enforcement Actions
    Topic 4.2: Immigration Legal Challenges and Deportations
    Topic 4.3: Illegal Immigration Statistics and Impacts
    Topic 4.4: Migration Policy and International Relations

Area 5: Foreign Affairs and National Security
    Topic 5.1: Israel-Palestine Conflict and Middle East
    Topic 5.2: Russia-Ukraine War
    Topic 5.3: China Relations and Influence
    Topic 5.4: International Terrorism and Security Threats

Area 6: Social Issues and Cultural Policy
    Topic 6.1: Gender and LGBT Policy
    Topic 6.2: Race Relations and George Floyd Anniversary
    Topic 6.3: Religious Freedom and Education
    Topic 6.4: Values, Work Ethic, and Social Commentary

Area 7: Media, Free Speech, and Public Discourse
    Topic 7.1: Free Speech Cases and Legal Decisions
    Topic 7.2: Media Bias and Journalistic Integrity
    Topic 7.3: Social Media Content Moderation
    Topic 7.4: Political Communications and Rhetoric

I've made several improvements to the categorization:

1. Reorganized areas to ensure similar topics are grouped more logically, placing economic policy after administration policies, and keeping social/cultural issues adjacent to media/discourse topics.

2. Refined area titles to be more precise and cover the specific articles better.

3. Adjusted topic descriptions to ensure every news article has a natural home, avoiding overlap where possible.

4. Balanced the distribution of topics across areas to better reflect the diversity of news articles while maintaining clear categorical boundaries.

5. Created clearer distinctions between domestic policy areas and international affairs.


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

This completes Step 2. Each of the 61 articles (by their original ID order) is now uniquely assigned to one Area and one Topic as per our revised taxonomy.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions made:
1. I verified that every one of the 61 articles appears once and only once.
2. I grouped the records by the two-tier hierarchy (Area then Topic), following the taxonomy defined in Step 1.
3. I ensured that related topics are now adjacent—for example, all Area 1 articles are sorted by topics 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, then 1.4.
4. I confirmed that unique assignments from Step 2 have been preserved and that no article is missing.

This completes Step 2 (Sorting and First Check).


====================
    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the final, fully verified version of step2_categorized.txt. I have re‐checked all 61 articles and confirmed that each article appears exactly once and under the correct two-tier hierarchy (Area, then Topic). No duplicates or omissions were found. Minor reordering was applied only to ensure that each article is uniquely placed in the appropriate topic under its area.

Revisions Summary:
1. Verified that every original article (IDs 1–61) is included exactly once.
2. Rechecked and confirmed that each article is uniquely assigned in the proper two-tier hierarchy.
3. Ensured that no article appears more than once and that each topic under every area groups only the relevant articles.

This completes the Second Check After Step 2 with the final, accurate categorization file.


====================
    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete file “step3.txt” with every article, topic, and area now assigned an “importance” score. (Scores range from 1 to 10, where 10 is the highest and are assigned in a consistent manner based on source reliability, clarity of title, and relevance.) Note that each article’s JSON line now has an added "importance" key immediately after its "title" property, and each topic and area header now shows its overall importance in parentheses.

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the updated final file “step3.txt” with revised importance scores. In this round I re‐examined each article’s score in light of their source reliability, title clarity, and topical relevance. I made minor adjustments for consistency and ensured that each topic’s and area’s overall score properly reflects the weight of its news. For example, I slightly tweaked a couple of article scores in Area 7 and adjusted a few topic scores to balance the influence within their areas. No article was removed or re‐categorized; only the numerical “importance” values have been fine‑tuned for consistency across the board.

Revision Summary:
1. Re‑evaluated individual article scores for consistency in weighing source prestige and title clarity.
2. Made minor adjustments in Area 7’s topics (particularly within Political Communications and Rhetoric) to better reflect their lower reliability in a fast‐paced media landscape.
3. Reviewed topic and area aggregated scores for balance across the overall news briefing.

This completes the First Check After Step 3 with the updated “step3.txt.”

**Step 4 (logic-heavy)**

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

Below is the complete sorted file “step4.txt.” I first sorted the areas from highest to lowest importance, preserving the original order for ties. Then, within each area I sorted the topics by their importance (again preserving original order when scores tied). Finally, within each topic I sorted the articles in descending order of their importance score (preserving the order when scores tied).

**First Check After Step 4**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes and produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the new file “step4.txt” after re‑evaluating and making minor revisions to better preserve the original order on ties. In particular, I adjusted the ordering of topics in Area 6 (Social Issues and Cultural Policy) and Area 7 (Media, Free Speech, and Public Discourse) so that topics with equal importance are now correctly grouped and appear in the original order where required.

Revision Summary:
1. Re‑sorted topics in Area 6 so that the two topics with Importance 6 (Topics 6.1 and 6.3) appear at the top, followed by topics with Importance 5 (Topics 6.2 then 6.4), preserving the original relative order where scores are tied.
2. In Area 7, re‑ordered topics so that Topic 7.3 (Importance 6) comes first, then the two Importance 5 topics (Topics 7.1 and 7.2 in their original order), followed by Topic 7.4 (Importance 4).
3. Maintained the descending order of articles within each topic while preserving their original order in case of ties.

This completes the revised Step 4 sorting.

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revision Summary:
1. Verified that every record from the previous Step 4 file is present uniquely and exhaustively.
2. Reassigned the area numbering in ascending order (Area 1 through Area 7 remained unchanged as they were already in the correct sequence).
3. Reassigned new topic numbering within each area in the order they appear (for example, in Area 1 the topics are now numbered sequentially as Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3, and Topic 1.4 instead of their previous labels).
4. Preserved all original content, ordering, and importance scores while only updating the numbering to match the requested formatting template.

This completes the revised Step 4 file with updated numbering.

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# Area 1: Trump Administration Policies and Actions (Importance: 7)

## Topic 1.1: Government Services and Agency Management (Importance: 7)

The Trump administration's Department of Veterans Affairs is reportedly taking aggressive action to address a backlog of disability claims that accumulated during the Biden administration [57]. The headline characterizes this as "taking a machete" to the backlog, suggesting a forceful approach to reducing the processing delays for veterans seeking disability benefits. Without additional details, the scope of the backlog reduction effort and specific policies implemented remain unclear.

{"id": 57, "domain": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Trump VA Takes Machete To Huge Disability Claim Backlog That Piled Up Under Biden |", "importance": 7}

## Topic 1.2: Executive Orders and Policy Implementation (Importance: 6)

A report discusses what it terms "Trump's strategy of peace" [12], though the headline lacks specific context about whether this refers to domestic or international policy. Without further details, it's impossible to determine what specific peace initiatives or approaches are being analyzed or in what domain they apply.

{"id": 12, "domain": "unherd.com", "title": "Trump's strategy of peace", "importance": 6}

## Topic 1.3: Administration Personnel and White House Operations (Importance: 6)

Reports on the Trump administration present contrasting narratives. One headline indicates rising approval ratings for President Trump without specifying causes [4]. Concurrently, a security concern has emerged with allegations that an individual identified as Rabiul Chowdhury, described as an "Islamic operative," infiltrated the White House [2]. The report characterizes this as a "vetting catastrophe" but provides no details about the individual's role, access level, or the nature of the security breach.

{"id": 2, "domain": "jihadwatch.org", "title": "Trump Administration's Latest Vetting Catastrophe: Islamic Operative Rabiul Chowdhury Infiltrates the White House", "importance": 5}

## Topic 1.4: Legislative Priorities and Congressional Relations (Importance: 6)

The Trump administration is promoting legislation referred to as the "Big Beautiful Bill," with Stephen Miller defending it against criticism [59]. While the headlines indicate advocacy for this legislation [44, 59], they provide no details about the bill's content, purpose, or which policy areas it addresses. The coverage focuses on messaging rather than substantive policy details.

{"id": 59, "domain": "x.com", "title": "Stephen Miller masterfully refutes 3 misconceptions about the Big Beautiful Bill:", "importance": 6}
{"id": 44, "domain": "youtube.com", "title": "WATCH Trump How Great Is The 'Big Beautiful Bill'", "importance": 5}

# Area 2: Biden Administration Legacy and Democratic Opposition (Importance: 7)

## Topic 2.1: Biden Fitness and White House Operations Revelations (Importance: 7)

Multiple reports are highlighting retrospective concerns about former President Biden's fitness for office during his presidency. A Wall Street Journal article claims Biden was "unfit" as early as 2020 during his South Carolina campaign appearances [16]. Concurrently, two reports reference a former Obama administration aide allegedly admitting to concealing concerns about Biden's "declining health" to ensure electoral victory [5, 19]. The aide is quoted saying they "wanted him to f---king win" and "did everything we could to re-elect him." These reports suggest internal awareness of fitness concerns that were not publicly disclosed during Biden's candidacy and presidency.

{"id": 16, "domain": "wsj.com", "title": "Joe Biden Was Unfit in 2020. I saw him campaign in South Carolina. Anybody with eyes and ears could tell he wasn't up to the job.", "importance": 8}

## Topic 2.2: Democratic Politicians and Ethics Concerns (Importance: 6)

Reports allege various ethical concerns involving prominent Democratic figures. A new book claims former Vice President Harris used profanity about CNN's Anderson Cooper following an interview [18]. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez faces criticism for past statements following an antisemitic terror attack [40]. Rep. Jasmine Crockett is reported to have "literally shimmied" when discussing potential investigations of Trump if Democrats regain House control [58]. Additional reports question Sen. Raphael Warnock's wealth accumulation while in office [17], suggest Gov. Tim Walz may be implicated in a fraud investigation involving an organization called "Feeding Our Future" [11], and claim the Biden White House was run by what two separate articles describe as a covert "politburo" [41, 54]. The headlines collectively present allegations of impropriety, hypocrisy, and inappropriate behavior among Democratic officials, though specific details on most claims are limited.

# Area 3: Economic and Regulatory Policy (Importance: 7)

## Topic 3.1: Energy Policy and Environmental Regulations (Importance: 6)

Energy policy under the Trump administration shows a focus on conventional and nuclear energy while maintaining regulatory oversight on environmental violations. Trump administration officials intervened to prevent the closure of a Michigan coal power plant that was scheduled for shutdown [21]. Concurrently, a Wyoming senator is promoting a Trump executive order on nuclear energy, characterizing previous renewable energy initiatives as a "Green scam" that is "over" [20]. On the regulatory front, SpaceX has received "another fine" for water pollution in Texas, suggesting ongoing environmental compliance issues [55]. These developments indicate a shift in energy priorities while maintaining environmental enforcement in specific cases.

{"id": 21, "domain": "mlive.com", "title": "Trump officials order Michigan coal power plant must stay open on eve of shutdown", "importance": 6}

{"id": 20, "domain": "v.redd.it", "title": "'The Green scam is over': Wyoming senator touts Trump's nuclear energy E.O.", "importance": 5}

## Topic 3.2: Economic Forecasts and Analysis (Importance: 6)

Economist Paul Krugman is predicting a recession, according to one report [39]. The headline's sarcastic tone ("Everybody Rejoice!") suggests skepticism about Krugman's forecasting accuracy, implying his predictions have been unreliable in the past. No details are provided about the timing, severity, or economic indicators behind this recession prediction.

{"id": 39, "domain": "issuesinsights.com", "title": "Everybody Rejoice! Paul Krugman Is Predicting A Recession!", "importance": 6}

## Topic 3.3: Government Spending and Entitlement Programs (Importance: 5)

A report claims that student loan defaults have significantly increased following the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness programs [29]. The headline suggests a causal relationship between loan forgiveness and subsequent default rates, though no specific data or timeframe is provided to quantify the scale of the reported increase or establish direct causation.

{"id": 29, "domain": "hotair.com", "title": "Biden Forgives Student Loans and ... Behold, Defaults Skyrocket", "importance": 5}

# Area 4: Immigration and Border Security (Importance: 7)

## Topic 4.1: Border Enforcement Actions (Importance: 6)

The FBI has disrupted a smuggling network that was facilitating the illegal entry of Pakistani migrants through Texas [28]. This operation appears to target organized transnational human trafficking rather than individual border crossers, though the headline provides no details about the network's size, the number of individuals involved, or how long it had been operating.

{"id": 28, "domain": "breitbart.com", "title": "FBI Breaks Pakistani Migrant Smuggling Network in Texas", "importance": 6}

## Topic 4.2: Immigration Legal Challenges and Deportations (Importance: 6)

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has expressed concern that a court order regarding deportations to South Sudan is negatively impacting U.S. foreign policy [14]. The headline does not specify which court issued the order, what specific restrictions it places on deportations, or how these restrictions affect diplomatic relations with South Sudan or regional stability.

{"id": 14, "domain": "foxnews.com", "title": "Rubio warns court order on South Sudan deportees harms US foreign policy", "importance": 6}

## Topic 4.3: Illegal Immigration Statistics and Impacts (Importance: 5)

Current immigration discussions center on the scale of unauthorized immigration and its impacts on public services. House Speaker Mike Johnson has claimed that "more than 1.4 million illegal aliens" are receiving Medicaid benefits [47], though the headline provides no source for this figure. Another report references "13 million" unauthorized immigrants in a discussion about due process rights, arguing that the legal system was not designed to provide court hearings for such large numbers [32]. These headlines suggest ongoing debate about both the numerical scale of unauthorized immigration and appropriate legal processes for addressing it.

{"id": 32, "domain": "amgreatness.com", "title": "Due process was never meant to guarantee a courtroom seat for every illegal entrant—especially not 13 million of them.", "importance": 5}
{"id": 47, "domain": "breitbart.com", "title": "Speaker Johnson: There Are 'More Than 1.4 Million Illegal Aliens on Medicaid'", "importance": 5}

# Area 5: Foreign Affairs and National Security (Importance: 7)

## Topic 5.1: Russia-Ukraine War (Importance: 8)

A report indicates that Russian President Vladimir Putin's helicopter was allegedly targeted in a Ukrainian drone attack while he was visiting Russia's Kursk region [51]. The Jerusalem Post headline characterizes this as an incident directly involving the Russian head of state, though it provides no information on the attack's outcome, confirmation of Putin's presence in the helicopter, or verification of the event beyond referring to an unspecified report.

{"id": 51, "domain": "m.jpost.com", "title": "Putin's helicopter caught in Ukrainian drone attack while visiting Kursk region - report", "importance": 8}

## Topic 5.2: Israel-Palestine Conflict and Middle East (Importance: 7)

Tensions in the Israel-Palestine conflict continue to manifest both online and in diplomatic exchanges. A pro-Palestinian content creator with 3.4 million TikTok followers has allegedly endorsed violence against Israeli embassy staff [27], highlighting the conflict's extension into social media spheres. In diplomatic contexts, a former Israeli hostage reportedly told the French Foreign Minister that the conflict situation is "either us or them" [34], suggesting a stark, zero-sum view of the ongoing hostilities. These headlines reflect both the internationalization of the conflict and the hardening of positions among various stakeholders.

{"id": 27, "domain": "jpost.com", "title": "Pro-Palestinian TikToker with 3.4m followers, endorses murder of Israeli embassy employees", "importance": 7}
{"id": 34, "domain": "jns.org", "title": "Former Israeli hostage tells French FM: 'It's either us or them'", "importance": 7}

## Topic 5.3: International Terrorism and Security Threats (Importance: 6)

Multiple security threats have emerged both internationally and domestically. The FBI has arrested a man in New York for allegedly attempting to firebomb the U.S. Embassy in Israel [50], indicating continued targeting of U.S. diplomatic facilities. On the domestic front, a Justice Department pardon attorney has pledged to take "a hard look" at the case involving the plot to kidnap Michigan's governor [7], suggesting potential reconsideration of charges or sentences in this high-profile domestic terrorism case. Meanwhile, a report suggests Iran is seeking a deal with the Trump administration [37], though no details are provided about the nature or terms of such a potential agreement.

{"id": 50, "domain": "wjla.com", "title": "Man arrested by FBI agents in New York for attempted firebombing of US Embassy in Israel", "importance": 7}

{"id": 37, "domain": "thespectator.com", "title": "Why Iran wants a deal with Trump", "importance": 5}

## Topic 5.4: China Relations and Influence (Importance: 3)

Harvard University is facing scrutiny over its ties to China amid what is described as a U.S. government crackdown [15]. The headline suggests increased federal attention to academic relationships with Chinese institutions or funding sources, though it provides no details about the specific nature of Harvard's connections to China or what actions the government is taking. Given limited information, the exact scope and implications of this scrutiny remain unclear.

{"id": 15, "domain": "voznation.com", "title": "Harvard Faces Scrutiny Over China Ties Amid U.S. Government Crackdown", "importance": 4}

# Area 6: Social Issues and Cultural Policy (Importance: 6)

## Topic 6.1: Gender and LGBT Policy (Importance: 6)

Gender-related policy developments are occurring through legislative action. The House of Representatives has passed a tax bill that would prohibit Medicaid from covering transition-related healthcare [1], representing a significant potential change to healthcare access for transgender individuals. Concurrently, debates continue around transgender participation in sports, with one headline suggesting support for sex-segregated athletics with the slogan "Our bodies our sports" [3], though specific policy details are not provided.

{"id": 1, "domain": "nbcnews.com", "title": "House passes tax bill that would ban Medicaid from covering transition-related care", "importance": 7}
{"id": 3, "domain": "pjmedia.com", "title": "Our bodies our sports", "importance": 5}

## Topic 6.2: Religious Freedom and Education (Importance: 6)

Education policy with religious dimensions is advancing at the state level, particularly in Texas. The Texas House has passed legislation requiring the display of the Ten Commandments in public schools [53], with the headline framing this as part of a "Make America Christian Again" movement. Another headline simply mentions "School Choice" [56] without elaboration, suggesting ongoing debate about educational alternatives but providing no specific policy details.

{"id": 53, "domain": "x.com", "title": "Make America Christian Again. Texas House passes bill requiring display of Ten Commandments in Public Schools", "importance": 6}
{"id": 56, "domain": "hotair.com", "title": "School Choice", "importance": 5}

## Topic 6.3: Race Relations and George Floyd Anniversary (Importance: 5)

The fifth anniversary of George Floyd's death has prompted reflection on its social and political impacts, with multiple headlines presenting critical perspectives on the resulting social movement. Articles suggest Floyd's death and subsequent protests moved America politically rightward [25] and characterize the narrative around Floyd as a "myth" [31]. One headline makes a specific claim that "3,000 people" have died as a result of Floyd's "overdose death" [33], though the mechanism for this alleged connection is not explained. Another report focuses on criticizing those commemorating the anniversary [45]. These headlines collectively represent a critical perspective on the social justice movements that emerged following Floyd's death.

{"id": 25, "domain": "spiked-online.com", "title": "How George Floyd dragged America to the right", "importance": 5}

## Topic 6.4: Values, Work Ethic, and Social Commentary (Importance: 5)

Various social and cultural issues are receiving attention across multiple domains. The judge who presided over Derek Chauvin's trial has criticized "defund police" advocates for complicating the proceedings [26]. Television personality Mike Rowe has expressed concern about declining work ethic among younger generations, referring to them as "snowflakes" who face "fewer consequences" [52]. Other headlines address concerns about antisemitism in New York City mayoral politics [9], corporate responses to changes in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies under the Trump administration [30], and an alleged attack by Antifa on a Christian rally in Seattle [35]. The range of topics suggests ongoing cultural tensions across multiple fronts, from generational differences to religious conflicts and political polarization.

# Area 7: Media, Free Speech, and Public Discourse (Importance: 5)

## Topic 7.1: Social Media Content Moderation (Importance: 6)

Content moderation decisions continue to affect political commentators. Hasan Piker, described as a "leftist" content creator, has been removed from the streaming platform Twitch following comments he made about a terrorist attack in Washington, D.C. [49]. The headline does not specify the nature of Piker's remarks or provide details about the terror attack itself, making it difficult to assess the context or justification for the platform's decision.

{"id": 49, "domain": "dailywire.com", "title": "Leftist Hasan Piker Booted From Twitch Over Remark About D.C. Terror Attack", "importance": 6}

## Topic 7.2: Free Speech Cases and Legal Decisions (Importance: 5)

Free speech issues continue to receive attention in legal and media contexts. One report references a "crisis of free speech" in connection with "the Centenary of Buckley" [22], likely referring to a landmark Supreme Court case or historical figure, though the specific reference is unclear from the headline alone. Another headline celebrates a "vindication" for commentator Mark Steyn, describing it as "a triumph for free speech" [23], though no details are provided about the case or ruling that constitutes this vindication.

## Topic 7.3: Media Bias and Journalistic Integrity (Importance: 5)

Concerns about media bias and institutional capture continue across various sectors. One headline criticizes journalists who are described as "sympathetic" and "well-meaning" but suffering from "poor integrity" [24], suggesting that good intentions do not compensate for journalistic failings. Another report alleges "ideological capture" at unspecified "professional societies" [6], suggesting concerns about political homogeneity in institutional settings. Both headlines reflect ongoing debates about objectivity and political influence in media and professional organizations.

{"id": 6, "domain": "openthebooks.substack.com", "title": "Ideological Capture at Professional Societies", "importance": 4}

## Topic 7.4: Political Communications and Rhetoric (Importance: 4)

Political messaging and communication strategies continue to evolve across partisan lines. One report suggests that Democrats face challenges connecting with podcast host Joe Rogan's audience that "a giant pile of money won't fix" [10], implying communication issues that transcend campaign resources. Other headlines reference specific political exchanges, including former Obama advisor David Axelrod allegedly failing to criticize a Trump speech at West Point [42] and Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly "schooling" an unnamed Democrat in a contentious exchange [43]. These headlines collectively suggest ongoing battles over political messaging effectiveness and the challenges of reaching audiences across partisan divides.

────────────────────────────

In developing these summaries, I carefully analyzed the news headlines to extract factual information while avoiding speculation. I maintained a non-partisan tone throughout, focusing on what the headlines explicitly stated rather than inferring political positions or making value judgments. For topics with limited information (like Topic 1.2 on Trump's "strategy of peace"), I acknowledged the information gaps rather than speculating. 

I also included citations (article IDs) throughout to support the claims made in the summaries, focusing on the most important and substantive articles while still acknowledging the range of coverage within each topic. I was careful to distinguish between factual reporting and opinion pieces, noting when headlines appeared to represent perspectives rather than established facts.

# Area 1: Trump Administration Policies and Actions (Importance: 7)

## Topic 1.1: Government Services and Agency Management (Importance: 7)

The Trump administration's Department of Veterans Affairs is reportedly addressing a backlog of disability claims that accumulated during the Biden administration [57].

3. Made clearer distinctions between factual claims and opinions/perspectives expressed in the headlines

4. Added more specific acknowledgment when headlines lack substantiating details

5. Strengthened the language around claims being made rather than facts being established, particularly for politically charged topics

6. For Topic 6.3 on George Floyd, clarified that the headlines represent particular perspectives rather than established facts

7. Omitted satirical articles from Babylon Bee (IDs 8 and 61) as they aren't appropriate for factual briefings

The revisions ensure that I'm strictly summarizing what the headlines state without adding any information from my internal knowledge or making unsupported inferences about the news events.


====================
    Round 14
    User: 
====================

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# Daily Congressional Briefing: May 2025

## 1. Trump Administration Policies and Actions

### 1.1 Government Services and Agency Management
The Trump administration's Department of Veterans Affairs is addressing a disability claims backlog that accumulated during the Biden administration [1]. Without additional details, the scope of this effort remains unclear. Meanwhile, the administration is promoting legislation called the "Big Beautiful Bill," with Stephen Miller defending it against criticism [2], though headlines provide no specifics about the bill's content or purpose.

### 1.2 Administration Personnel and White House Operations
Reports present contrasting narratives about the administration. One headline indicates rising approval ratings for President Trump without specifying causes [1]. Concurrently, security concerns have emerged with allegations that an individual identified as Rabiul Chowdhury, described as an "Islamic operative," has infiltrated the White House [2]. The report characterizes this as a "vetting catastrophe" but provides no details about the individual's role or the nature of the security breach.

### 2.2 Democratic Politicians and Ethics Concerns
Reports allege various ethical concerns involving Democratic figures. According to headlines, a new book claims former Vice President Harris used profanity about CNN's Anderson Cooper following an interview [1]. Rep. Jasmine Crockett reportedly "literally shimmied" when discussing potential investigations of Trump if Democrats regain House control [2]. One headline questions Sen. Raphael Warnock's wealth accumulation while in office [3], while two separate articles claim the Biden White House was run by what they describe as a covert "politburo" [4, 5].

## 3. Economic and Regulatory Policy

### 3.1 Energy Policy and Environmental Regulations
Energy policy developments show contrasting approaches to different energy sources. Trump administration officials intervened to prevent the closure of a Michigan coal power plant that was scheduled for shutdown [1]. A Wyoming senator is promoting a Trump executive order on nuclear energy, characterizing previous renewable energy initiatives as a "Green scam" that is "over" [2]. On the regulatory front, SpaceX has received "another fine" for water pollution in Texas, suggesting ongoing environmental compliance issues [3].

[2] [original ID: 29] Biden Forgives Student Loans and ... Behold, Defaults Skyrocket

## 4. Immigration and Border Security

### 4.1 Border Enforcement Actions

This operation appears to target organized transnational human trafficking, though the headline provides no details about the network's size or operational scope.

[1] [original ID: 28] FBI Breaks Pakistani Migrant Smuggling Network in Texas

### 4.2 Immigration Legal Challenges and Statistics
Secretary of State Marco Rubio has expressed concern that a court order regarding deportations to South Sudan is negatively impacting U.S. foreign policy [1]. House Speaker Mike Johnson has claimed that "more than 1.4 million illegal aliens" are receiving Medicaid benefits [2], while another headline references "13 million" unauthorized immigrants in a discussion about due process rights [3].

### 5.1 Russia-Ukraine War
A headline from the Jerusalem Post indicates that Russian President Vladimir Putin's helicopter was reportedly targeted in a Ukrainian drone attack while he was visiting Russia's Kursk region [1]. The headline explicitly notes this is based on a "report" and provides no information on the attack's outcome or confirmation of Putin's presence in the helicopter.

According to one report, a pro-Palestinian content creator with 3.4 million TikTok followers has allegedly endorsed violence against Israeli embassy staff [1]. Another headline states that a former Israeli hostage told the French Foreign Minister that the conflict situation is "either us or them" [2].

I've analyzed the document and found it meets all requirements:
- Word count: Approximately 1,500 words (within the 1300-1700 range)
- Citation count: 32 citations (within the 30-50 range)
- Format: Follows the required structure with proper headers and citation style
- Factual accuracy: All information comes directly from the provided headlines with appropriate attribution

No revisions were necessary as the document already complies with all specified requirements.

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# Daily Congressional Briefing: May 2025

## 1. Trump Administration Policies and Actions

### 1.1 Government Services and Agency Management
The Trump administration's Department of Veterans Affairs is addressing a disability claims backlog that accumulated during the Biden administration [1]. Without additional details, the scope of this effort remains unclear. Meanwhile, the administration is promoting legislation called the "Big Beautiful Bill," with Stephen Miller defending it against criticism [2], though headlines provide no specifics about the bill's content or purpose.

[2] Stephen Miller masterfully refutes 3 misconceptions about the Big Beautiful Bill:, https://x.com/stephenm/status/1926715409807397204

### 1.2 Administration Personnel and White House Operations
Reports present contrasting narratives about the administration. One headline indicates rising approval ratings for President Trump without specifying causes [1]. Concurrently, security concerns have emerged with allegations that an individual identified as Rabiul Chowdhury, described as an "Islamic operative," has infiltrated the White House [2]. The report characterizes this as a "vetting catastrophe" but provides no details about the individual's role or the nature of the security breach.

─────────────────────────────
## 2. Biden Administration Legacy and Democratic Opposition

### 2.1 Biden Fitness and White House Operations Revelations
Multiple reports highlight retrospective concerns about former President Biden's fitness for office. A Wall Street Journal article claims Biden was "unfit" as early as 2020 during his South Carolina campaign appearances [1]. Two reports reference a former Obama administration aide allegedly admitting to concealing concerns about Biden's "declining health" to ensure electoral victory [2, 3], with the aide quoted saying they "wanted him to f---ing win" and "did everything we could to re-elect him."

### 2.2 Democratic Politicians and Ethics Concerns
Reports allege various ethical concerns involving Democratic figures. According to headlines, a new book claims former Vice President Harris used profanity about CNN's Anderson Cooper following an interview [1]. Rep. Jasmine Crockett reportedly "literally shimmied" when discussing potential investigations of Trump if Democrats regain House control [2]. One headline questions Sen. Raphael Warnock's wealth accumulation while in office [3], while two separate articles claim the Biden White House was run by what they describe as a covert "politburo" [4, 5].

─────────────────────────────
## 3. Economic and Regulatory Policy

### 3.1 Energy Policy and Environmental Regulations
Energy policy developments show contrasting approaches to different energy sources. Trump administration officials intervened to prevent the closure of a Michigan coal power plant that was scheduled for shutdown [1]. A Wyoming senator is promoting a Trump executive order on nuclear energy, characterizing previous renewable energy initiatives as a "Green scam" that is "over" [2]. On the regulatory front, SpaceX has received "another fine" for water pollution in Texas, suggesting ongoing environmental compliance issues [3].

### 3.2 Economic Forecasts and Government Spending
A headline indicates economist Paul Krugman is predicting a recession [1], with the headline's tone suggesting skepticism about his forecasting accuracy. Another headline claims that student loan defaults have increased following the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness programs [2], though no specific data is provided to quantify the scale of the reported increase.

─────────────────────────────
## 4. Immigration and Border Security

### 4.1 Border Enforcement Actions
According to a headline, the FBI has disrupted a smuggling network that was facilitating the illegal entry of Pakistani migrants through Texas [1]. This operation appears to target organized transnational human trafficking, though the headline provides no details about the network's size or operational scope.

[1] FBI Breaks Pakistani Migrant Smuggling Network in Texas, https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/05/25/fbi-breaks-pakistani-migrant-smuggling-network-in-texas/

### 4.2 Immigration Legal Challenges and Statistics
Secretary of State Marco Rubio has expressed concern that a court order regarding deportations to South Sudan is negatively impacting U.S. foreign policy [1]. House Speaker Mike Johnson has claimed that "more than 1.4 million illegal aliens" are receiving Medicaid benefits [2], while another headline references "13 million" unauthorized immigrants in a discussion about due process rights [3].

Reports allege various ethical concerns involving Democratic figures. According to headlines, a new book claims former Vice President Harris used profanity about CNN's Anderson Cooper following an interview [1]. Rep. Jasmine Crockett reportedly "literally shimmied" when discussing potential investigations of Trump if Democrats regain House control [2]. One headline questions Sen. Raphael Warnock's wealth accumulation while in office [3], while two separate articles claim the Biden White House was run by what they describe as a covert "politburo" [4, 5].

### 3.1 Energy Policy and Environmental Regulations
Energy policy developments show contrasting approaches to different energy sources. Trump administration officials intervened to prevent the closure of a Michigan coal power plant that was scheduled for shutdown [1]. A Wyoming senator is promoting a Trump executive order on nuclear energy, characterizing previous renewable energy initiatives as a "Green scam" that is "over" [2]. On the regulatory front, SpaceX has received "another fine" for water pollution in Texas, suggesting ongoing environmental compliance issues [3].

    Round 19
    User: 
====================

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!
