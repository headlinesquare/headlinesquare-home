**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/Conservative.**

r/Conservative is a subreddit dedicated to discussion and content from a conservative political perspective, primarily in the context of U.S. politics. Here's a brief overview:
**Focus:** Conservative values, ideas, and viewpoints.
**Content:** News articles, political commentary, opinion pieces, and discussions supportive of or aligned with right-leaning ideologies.
**Tone:** The subreddit encourages civil discourse among conservatives and welcomes questions from others, though it's not meant to be a debate forum for opposing views.
**Common Topics:** Fiscal conservatism, limited government, gun rights, immigration policy, criticism of liberal/progressive policies, and support for Republican politicians and platforms.

It's heavily moderated to maintain a conservative-friendly space, and moderation tends to enforce rules that limit trolling or ideological arguments from non-conservatives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines containing today's Reddit news posts from r/Conservative. I understand my task is to transform these into an objective Daily Briefing for both Democratic and Republican leadership, set in May 2025. I'll process the information through the 8-step workflow you've outlined, focusing on factual accuracy while being mindful that my internal knowledge is outdated and I should rely solely on the information provided.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

---

**Revisions made:**
1. Reorganized areas to improve cognitive flow, with related topics grouped together
2. Combined previous Biden and Trump administration areas into a unified "Executive Branch" area while maintaining separate topics
3. Added a dedicated "Congress & Legislation" area to better capture legislative news
4. Clarified topic names to ensure all articles can be appropriately categorized
5. Reduced overlap between categories while ensuring comprehensive coverage
6. Reordered areas to create a logical flow from domestic governance to international affairs to media coverage


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revisions Made:
1. I verified each of the 65 articles appears exactly once and has been uniquely assigned to one area/topic based on its headline.
2. I re-sorted the assignments into a clear hierarchy by Area (using the order defined in Step 1) and then by Topic (sorted by our defined order: e.g., for Area 1, Topics 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4).
3. Within each topic, articles are listed in ascending order of their IDs (i.e. roughly matching their original chronological order).
4. I ensured that the formatting now only shows the JSON lines under each Area/Topic with no extraneous headers.

This completes the first check and sorting for Step 2.


====================
    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised step2_categorized.txt file. In this revision I have re‐checked every JSON record to ensure that all 65 articles appear exactly once and are placed in the proper hierarchical category (Area then Topic) in ascending order by ID. I have also rechecked that each article’s assignment is unique and exhaustively covers all records. No article was missing or duplicated. One minor consideration was re‑examining record 24 (EU elections) to confirm that placing it under “International Affairs → US‐Foreign Relations” is acceptable given our available topics. No re‑assignment was necessary.

Revisions and Checks Made:
1. Re‑verified that each of the 65 JSON records is present exactly once.
2. Confirmed that the hierarchical grouping (by Area then Topic) is complete and ordered with articles sorted by ascending ID within each topic.
3. Re‑examined borderline cases (e.g. record 24) and confirmed that the current topic assignment is acceptable.
4. Ensured that formatting has been consistently applied throughout.

This completes the second check after Step 2.


====================
    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete final output for step3.txt. In this file, each article’s JSON line now includes an "importance" field (inserted immediately after "title") with its article‐level score (from 1 to 10). In addition, each Topic is annotated with a Topic Importance score, and each Area is given an overall Area Importance score. (All scores follow our consistent standard based on source reliability, clarity/relevance of the title, and issue significance.)

This completes Step 3. Each article, topic, and area now has a defined importance score based on our consistent standard.


====================
    Round 8
    User: 
====================

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the final revised step3.txt. In this file every article now has an inserted "importance" score (from 1 to 10) immediately following the "title" field. In addition, each Topic and each Area is annotated with an overall importance score. After careful re‐evaluation, I made only very minor adjustments for consistency across similar items (for example, slightly recalibrating a couple of scores in the Supreme Court decisions and foreign relations topics) while preserving our original intent. All records are uniquely present and the scores remain aligned with source reliability, title clarity, and issue significance.

Revision Summary:
1. After re‐evaluating all scores and assignments, I confirmed that every record is uniquely represented and each article’s importance is in the appropriate range.
2. I made very minor adjustments on a couple of articles (for example, ensuring consistency among related Supreme Court and international affairs headlines) while keeping our overall scoring scheme intact.
3. All topics and areas now have clearly indicated importance scores, with the scale used sparingly to reserve “10” for only the highest-impact items.

This completes the revised Step 3.


====================
    Round 9

**Step 4 (logic-heavy)**

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 9
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete final output for step4.txt. Note that we first sorted the Areas by their “Area Importance” (with ties resolved by preserving the original order), then within each Area we sorted the Topics by their “Topic Importance” (again preserving original order on ties), and finally within each Topic we sorted the news articles by their individual “importance” (with ties preserving the original order from step3.txt).

    User: 
====================

**First Check After Step 4**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes and produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 10
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised step4.txt file. In this version, I made minor adjustments to ensure that every area, topic, and article is sorted strictly in descending order by its importance (using the provided importance values) and that ties are broken using the original order from the previous step. In particular, I re-ordered topics in Area 6 so that Topic 6.1 (importance 9) comes first, followed by Topic 6.4 (importance 7) and then Topic 6.2 (importance 6), and I verified that all articles within topics are sorted properly. No information was dropped.

Revisions Summary:
1. Re-sorted the areas to ensure those with an Importance of 8 (Area 1, Area 3, Area 6) are placed before the areas with Importance 7 and 6, preserving original order for ties.
2. Within each area, topics are now strictly sorted by Topic Importance (in descending order), with Area 6’s topics now ordered as 6.1 (importance 9), 6.4 (importance 7), then 6.2 (importance 6).
3. Each topic’s articles have been re-ordered in descending order by article “importance” with ties kept in their original order.

This completes the revised Step 4.

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Below is the new step4.txt file with revised ascending numbering for areas and topics. I have preserved every record and the content exactly as before while only updating the area and topic numbers based on their order of appearance.

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Area 1: Executive Branch (Area Importance: 8)
  
Topic 1.1: Trump Administration Policies and Actions (Topic Importance: 8)

The Trump administration is pursuing multiple policy initiatives across economic and institutional domains in May 2025. President Trump has secured a legislative victory with his "big, beautiful bill" overcoming internal Republican opposition, marking a significant achievement in implementing his agenda (3). Concurrently, the White House economic director has projected economic growth through a combination of trade agreements and tax reduction policies (43). In international financial policy, the administration appears poised to alter the World Bank's climate-related priorities, with the Wall Street Journal suggesting Trump can end what it characterizes as "climate hypocrisy" at the institution (58). On the political front, the President has called for an investigation into his former electoral opponent, suggesting that Vice President Harris's campaign may have improperly compensated celebrities including Bruce Springsteen and Beyoncé for their endorsements during the 2024 election cycle (10).

Topic 1.2: Biden Administration and Legacy (Topic Importance: 6)

Recent reporting on the Biden administration focuses extensively on allegations that senior officials concealed President Biden's cognitive decline during his term. CNN commentator Van Jones has been quoted stating Democrats will "pay for a long time" for what he characterized as covering up Biden's condition, calling it a "crime against this Republic" (12, 42). A book cited by The Hill alleges the administration employed specific production techniques during Cabinet meetings, including scripted proceedings and multiple camera setups designed to avoid capturing potential verbal or physical missteps (64). Additional reporting claims the Biden team made unusual modifications to critical communications infrastructure, specifically altering the emergency hotline between Washington D.C. and the Pentagon (4). These reports collectively contribute to an emerging narrative about information management practices during the previous administration, though specific details remain limited in the available headlines.

Topic 1.3: Executive Appointments and Staffing (Topic Importance: 6)

Executive staffing developments in the Trump administration include notable appointments and shifting personnel dynamics. The administration has appointed Alice Marie Johnson, whose sentence was previously commuted by Trump during his first term, to oversee the federal pardon process in a role characterized as "Pardon Czar" (53). Questions have emerged about the public visibility of Elon Musk in his capacity as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with reporting examining his reduced media presence since assuming the position (63). In a transition-related development, a former press secretary to Dr. Jill Biden has reportedly expressed willingness to disclose internal information about operations within the previous administration (44). These staffing developments reflect both continuity with Trump's previous term through appointments of individuals with prior connections and potential information flows from the outgoing administration.

Topic 1.4: Presidential Health Issues (Topic Importance: 5)

Former President Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis has generated substantial media scrutiny regarding the timing and transparency of health disclosures. Multiple medical experts have questioned the official timeline of the diagnosis, with some calling it "unbelievable this was missed" during his presidency (14, 17). Social media posts have circulated video from October 2024 in which Biden allegedly referenced "cancer drugs" during a coughing episode, fueling speculation about earlier awareness of his condition (15). Biden himself has issued a statement on his diagnosis that includes the phrase "We are strongest in the broken places" (19). Donald Trump Jr. has publicly questioned the timing of the cancer announcement (31), while multiple conservative commentators have suggested the diagnosis represents part of a pattern of health-related non-disclosure (30, 60). The collection of reports indicates continued public interest in transparency surrounding the former president's medical condition, though details about current treatment protocols or prognosis remain limited.

Area 2: Legal Affairs & Judiciary (Area Importance: 8)
  
Topic 2.1: Supreme Court Decisions (Topic Importance: 8)

The Supreme Court has issued a consequential ruling permitting the Trump administration to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelan immigrants in the United States. Multiple sources confirm the decision affects approximately 350,000 Venezuelans currently residing in the country under protections established during the previous administration (29, 51). The ruling enables the government to revoke legal protections previously granted through the Biden administration's parole program (36), potentially leading to deportation proceedings for those affected (33). This represents a significant judicial endorsement of the administration's authority over immigration status designations and marks a substantial victory for the Trump administration's broader immigration enforcement agenda. The decision appears to have proceeded without unanimous support on the Court, though headlines do not specify the exact vote breakdown.

Topic 2.2: Federal Legal Settlements (Topic Importance: 7)

The federal government has reached a significant legal settlement with the family of Ashli Babbitt, who died during the January 6, 2021, Capitol events. According to reports from The Washington Post, as cited by multiple sources, the Trump administration has agreed to pay nearly $5 million to Babbitt's family (39, 49). This settlement represents a substantial financial resolution in a case that has remained politically sensitive since the Capitol riot. The available headlines do not provide specific details about the settlement terms beyond the monetary amount, nor do they indicate whether the agreement includes any admission of liability by the government. This development marks a notable shift in the federal response to litigation arising from the January 6 events compared to the previous administration's approach.

Topic 2.3: Criminal Justice Developments (Topic Importance: 6)

In local criminal justice developments, newly elected Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman has pledged to implement stricter enforcement approaches in one of America's largest metropolitan justice systems. According to Fox News, Hochman has explicitly committed that "criminals will face consequences in LA," signaling a shift in prosecutorial priorities and potentially reversing policies of his predecessor (8). Without additional headlines in this category, specific details about implementation plans, particular crime categories being prioritized, or specific policy changes remain unavailable, making it difficult to assess the precise nature and scope of the enforcement shift in Los Angeles County.

Topic 2.4: Department of Justice Actions (Topic Importance: 6)

The Department of Justice has launched an investigation into employment practices in Chicago following controversial statements by the city's mayor. According to reports, the federal inquiry was initiated after the mayor allegedly "bragged about racial discrimination" in municipal hiring practices (65). The single headline provides limited context regarding the scope, timeline, or specific allegations involved in the investigation.

Topic 3.1: Russia-Ukraine Conflict (Topic Importance: 9)

Diplomatic initiatives regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict have intensified following direct communication between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The leaders engaged in a reported two-hour phone conversation, though contradictory accounts have emerged about progress toward ending hostilities. One report indicates President Trump announced that Russia and Ukraine would "immediately start negotiations toward a ceasefire and an end to the war" following the call (34). However, Fox News subsequently reported that despite the extended discussion, "no ceasefire advances were made" during the conversation (54). These conflicting reports highlight the complexity of diplomatic communications and the challenges in achieving verifiable progress toward conflict resolution. The headlines provide limited information about specific proposals discussed, conditions for potential negotiations, or reactions from Ukrainian leadership to these diplomatic developments.

Azerbaijani news source APA reported the commencement of a phone conversation between President Trump and Russian President Putin (16), which appears to be the same call referenced in reporting on the Ukraine conflict. Separately, European electoral outcomes have drawn attention, with reports highlighting that EU-aligned forces maintained influence in Romania while Portugal experienced unexpected political shifts characterized as a "wicked surprise" (24).

Legislative activity in Congress centers on a major fiscal package promoted by the Trump administration and supported by House leadership. One America News Network reports that House Speaker Mike Johnson has affirmed that the President's "Big Beautiful Bill," which reportedly includes $900 billion in spending cuts, remains "on track" despite opposition from some Republican legislators (11). The bill appears to face internal resistance within the GOP caucus, with Johnson acknowledging but downplaying the significance of "defectors" opposing the legislation. The single headline provides limited insight into specific provisions of the bill, its timeline for consideration, or the extent of intra-party resistance that might affect its prospects for passage.

Political organizations supporting the Trump administration's policy agenda are taking shape as the administration develops its second-term approach. Real Clear Politics reports on the America First Policy Institute, described as a "MAGA Think Tank" that is providing staffing resources for the president's second term, suggesting institutional continuity with the administration's ideological priorities (38). In an unrelated development with foreign policy implications, PJ Media claims to have evidence ("smoking gun") that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) had advance knowledge of the October 7, 2023 attacks in Israel (52). The headlines provide minimal detail about either the organizational structure of the America First Policy Institute or the specific nature of the alleged evidence regarding UNRWA's prior awareness of the attacks.

State-level immigration funding has emerged as a point of political controversy in Illinois. The Center Square reports that a state legislator has criticized the Democrat-led government for allegedly allocating $3.2 billion for "illegal immigrants" while neglecting "working American families" (1). This funding decision has apparently created tension between prioritizing resources for undocumented immigrants versus directing financial support toward citizen residents. The single headline offers limited context about the specific programs funded, their implementation timeline, or the broader fiscal framework involved in these allocations. Without additional information, it remains unclear which specific immigrant services are being funded or what alternative spending priorities the critical legislator advocates.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations continue to generate both political discourse and national security enforcement actions. Reports indicate that Minnesota Governor Tim Walz previously characterized ICE as a "modern-day Gestapo," prompting a response from the Trump team (23). In a separate enforcement action with national security implications, ICE has deported a Chinese national convicted of conducting drone photography of American military installations (62).

Federal fiscal performance shows significant developments under the Trump administration's economic policies. Money Wise reports that the U.S. Treasury recorded a $258 billion surplus, described as the second-largest monthly surplus in American history, raising questions about the effectiveness of the administration's economic approach (7). The headline framing suggests this result has exceeded market expectations. Separately, questions have emerged regarding potential changes to taxation policy for Social Security benefits (9).

The financial services firm Moody's decision to downgrade U.S. federal bonds has drawn sharp criticism from economic commentators aligned with the administration's policies. Fox Business published multiple opinion pieces by economic analyst Stephen Moore questioning Moody's credibility and suggesting political bias motivated their decision to downgrade U.S. federal debt instruments (21, 45). Moore specifically alleges that the downgrade reflects opposition to Trump's tax reduction policies rather than objective financial analysis of U.S. creditworthiness. The headlines provide limited information about Moody's specific rationale for the downgrade, the timing of the rating change, or broader market reactions to the adjusted credit assessment.

Leadership changes at CBS News have occurred amid legal disputes with the Trump administration. Multiple sources report the unexpected resignation of CBS News President/CEO Wendy McMahon (20, 61, 40). The New York Post specifically connects her departure to internal disagreement over settling a lawsuit filed by former President Trump regarding a "60 Minutes" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign, with McMahon reportedly opposing settlement (61). A statement attributed to McMahon indicates fundamental disagreement with corporate leadership, saying "it's become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward." Reports characterize the situation as continued organizational instability, with RedState describing ongoing executive departures from the network. The headlines provide limited detail about the specific nature of Trump's legal claims or the broader implications for CBS News editorial policies.

Political rhetoric and personal disclosures from public figures span a range of controversies and health announcements. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has generated attention for characterizing Republican women as "handmaidens of the patriarchy," using terminology that has provoked response from conservative commentators (18). Political cartoonist and commentator Scott Adams has publicly disclosed a prostate cancer diagnosis (28), coincidentally following former President Biden's similar diagnosis. Other reports examine relationship changes for Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, noting the apparent absence of her engagement ring and raising questions about benefits received by her fiancé (25). Additional headlines highlight contentious interactions between Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders (41), with separate coverage claiming Sanders has criticized his own party's commitment to democratic principles (47). Collectively, these disparate headlines reflect the personalized and rhetorical elements that often dominate contemporary political discourse, though many lack substantive policy content.

Digital platform dynamics include both educational technology trends and social media community management challenges. The Free Press published an article arguing positively for artificial intelligence use in educational settings, contending that AI assistance in schoolwork may have beneficial effects despite widespread concerns about academic dishonesty (35). On the Reddit platform specifically, users have shared strategies for navigating cross-community moderation practices, with one post providing instructions for blocking automated systems that might restrict participation across ideologically different subreddits (59).

Topic 1.1: Trump Administration Policies and Actions (Topic Importance: 8)

The Trump administration is pursuing multiple policy initiatives across economic and institutional domains in May 2025. President Trump has secured a legislative victory with his "big, beautiful bill" overcoming internal Republican opposition, marking a significant achievement in implementing his agenda (3). Concurrently, the White House economic director has projected economic growth through a combination of trade agreements and tax reduction policies (43). In international financial policy, the administration appears poised to alter the World Bank's climate-related priorities, with the Wall Street Journal suggesting Trump can end what it characterizes as "climate hypocrisy" at the institution (58). On the political front, the President has called for an investigation into his former electoral opponent, suggesting that Vice President Harris's campaign may have improperly compensated celebrities including Bruce Springsteen and Beyoncé for their endorsements during the 2024 election cycle (10).

Recent reporting on the Biden administration focuses extensively on allegations that senior officials concealed President Biden's cognitive decline during his term. CNN commentator Van Jones has been quoted stating Democrats will "pay for a long time" for what he characterized as covering up Biden's condition, calling it a "crime against this Republic" (12, 42). A book cited by The Hill alleges the administration employed specific production techniques during Cabinet meetings, including scripted proceedings and multiple camera setups designed to avoid capturing potential verbal or physical missteps (64). Additional reporting claims the Biden team made unusual modifications to critical communications infrastructure, specifically altering the emergency hotline between Washington D.C. and the Pentagon (4). These reports collectively contribute to an emerging narrative about information management practices during the previous administration, though specific details remain limited in the available headlines.

Questions have emerged about Elon Musk's public visibility, with reporting examining why he has "disappeared from the spotlight" (63). The headline does not specify details about Musk's current role or activities. In a transition-related development, a former press secretary to Dr. Jill Biden has reportedly expressed willingness to disclose internal information about operations within the previous administration (44). These staffing developments reflect both continuity with Trump's previous term through appointments of individuals with prior connections and potential information flows from the outgoing administration.

Social media posts have circulated video from October 2024 in which Biden allegedly referenced "cancer drugs" during a coughing episode, fueling speculation about earlier awareness of his condition (15). Biden himself has issued a statement on his diagnosis that includes the phrase "We are strongest in the broken places" (19). Donald Trump Jr. has publicly questioned the timing of the cancer announcement (31), while multiple conservative commentators have suggested the diagnosis represents part of a pattern of health-related non-disclosure (30, 60).

Multiple sources confirm the decision affects approximately 350,000 Venezuelans currently residing in the country under protections established during the previous administration (29, 51). The ruling enables the government to revoke legal protections previously granted through the Biden administration's parole program (36), potentially leading to deportation proceedings for those affected (33). This represents a significant judicial endorsement of the administration's authority over immigration status designations and marks a substantial victory for the Trump administration's broader immigration enforcement agenda.

This settlement represents a substantial financial resolution in a case that has remained politically sensitive since the Capitol riot. The available headlines do not provide specific details about the settlement terms beyond the monetary amount, nor do they indicate whether the agreement includes any admission of liability by the government.

Political organizations supporting the Trump administration's policy agenda are taking shape as the administration develops its second-term approach. Real Clear Politics reports on the America First Policy Institute, described as a "MAGA Think Tank" that is providing staffing resources for the president's second term, suggesting institutional continuity with the administration's ideological priorities (38). In an unrelated development with foreign policy implications, PJ Media claims to have evidence ("smoking gun") that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) had advance knowledge of the October 7, 2023 attacks in Israel (52). The headlines provide minimal detail about either the organizational structure of the America First Policy Institute or the specific nature of the alleged evidence regarding UNRWA's prior awareness of the attacks.

Area 5: Immigration & Border Policy (Area Importance: 7)
  
Topic 5.1: State-Level Immigration Policies (Topic Importance: 7)

State-level immigration funding has emerged as a point of political controversy in Illinois. The Center Square reports that a state legislator has criticized the Democrat-led government for allegedly allocating $3.2 billion for "illegal immigrants" while neglecting "working American families" (1). This funding decision has apparently created tension between prioritizing resources for undocumented immigrants versus directing financial support toward citizen residents. The single headline offers limited context about the specific programs funded, their implementation timeline, or the broader fiscal framework involved in these allocations. Without additional information, it remains unclear which specific immigrant services are being funded or what alternative spending priorities the critical legislator advocates.

Topic 5.2: Immigration Enforcement Actions (Topic Importance: 6)

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations continue to generate both political discourse and national security enforcement actions. Reports indicate that Minnesota Governor Tim Walz previously characterized ICE as a "modern-day Gestapo," prompting a response from the Trump team (23). In a separate enforcement action with national security implications, ICE has deported a Chinese national convicted of conducting drone photography of American military installations (62). The headlines provide limited context regarding the timing of Walz's comments, the specific nature of the Trump team's response, or details about the espionage case involving the deported individual, including when the surveillance activities occurred or which specific military sites were targeted.

Area 6: Economic Affairs & Business (Area Importance: 7)
  
Topic 6.1: Taxation and Economic Policy (Topic Importance: 7)

Federal fiscal performance shows significant developments under the Trump administration's economic policies. Money Wise reports that the U.S. Treasury recorded a $258 billion surplus, described as the second-largest monthly surplus in American history, raising questions about the effectiveness of the administration's economic approach (7). The headline framing suggests this result has exceeded market expectations. Separately, questions have emerged regarding potential changes to taxation policy for Social Security benefits (9). The headlines provide limited context about factors contributing to the reported surplus, whether it represents a sustainable fiscal trend, or specific policy proposals regarding potential modifications to Social Security taxation that might affect retirees and other benefits recipients.

Topic 6.2: Financial Markets and Credit Ratings (Topic Importance: 7)

The financial services firm Moody's decision to downgrade U.S. federal bonds has drawn sharp criticism from economic commentators aligned with the administration's policies. Fox Business published multiple opinion pieces by economic analyst Stephen Moore questioning Moody's credibility and suggesting political bias motivated their decision to downgrade U.S. federal debt instruments (21, 45). Moore specifically alleges that the downgrade reflects opposition to Trump's tax reduction policies rather than objective financial analysis of U.S. creditworthiness. The headlines provide limited information about Moody's specific rationale for the downgrade, the timing of the rating change, or broader market reactions to the adjusted credit assessment.

Topic 6.3: Corporate Policy Changes (Topic Importance: 6)

Major corporate policy shifts include changes to diversity initiatives at leading telecommunications companies. Fox Business reports that Verizon has terminated its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs and associated diversity goals (55). This development appears to align with a broader trend of corporations re-evaluating DEI initiatives amid changing political and cultural contexts. The single headline offers no additional information regarding Verizon's rationale for the decision, the scope of programs affected, specific metrics or goals being abandoned, or whether the change was prompted by internal business considerations or external pressures.

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Area 7: Media & Political Discourse (Area Importance: 6)
  
Topic 7.1: Media Organization Changes (Topic Importance: 7)

Leadership changes at CBS News have occurred amid legal disputes with the Trump administration. Multiple sources report the unexpected resignation of CBS News President/CEO Wendy McMahon (20, 61, 40). The New York Post specifically connects her departure to internal disagreement over settling a lawsuit filed by former President Trump regarding a "60 Minutes" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign, with McMahon reportedly opposing settlement (61). A statement attributed to McMahon indicates fundamental disagreement with corporate leadership, saying "it's become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward." Reports characterize the situation as continued organizational instability, with RedState describing ongoing executive departures from the network. The headlines provide limited detail about the specific nature of Trump's legal claims or the broader implications for CBS News editorial policies.

Topic 7.2: Media Coverage and Bias (Topic Importance: 7)

Questions have emerged regarding foreign influence in American media ecosystems. Ynet News reports on documents allegedly showing that Qatar's lobbying efforts have established significant connections within U.S. conservative media organizations (26). This reporting suggests intentional efforts by the Gulf state to shape American media coverage through strategic relationships with conservative outlets. The single headline provides no specific details about the nature, extent, or mechanisms of the reported influence operations, nor does it identify particular media organizations or individuals allegedly affected by these lobbying efforts.

{"id": 26, "domain": "ynetnews.com", "title": "Qatar lobby reaches deep into US conservative media, documents show", "importance": 7}
    
Topic 7.3: Political Communications and Controversies (Topic Importance: 5)

Political rhetoric and personal disclosures from public figures span a range of controversies and health announcements. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has generated attention for characterizing Republican women as "handmaidens of the patriarchy," using terminology that has provoked response from conservative commentators (18). Political cartoonist and commentator Scott Adams has publicly disclosed a prostate cancer diagnosis (28), coincidentally following former President Biden's similar diagnosis. Other reports examine relationship changes for Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, noting the apparent absence of her engagement ring and raising questions about benefits received by her fiancé (25). Additional headlines highlight contentious interactions between Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders (41), with separate coverage claiming Sanders has criticized his own party's commitment to democratic principles (47). Collectively, these disparate headlines reflect the personalized and rhetorical elements that often dominate contemporary political discourse, though many lack substantive policy content.

Topic 7.4: Social Media and Platform Issues (Topic Importance: 4)

Digital platform dynamics include both educational technology trends and social media community management challenges. The Free Press published an article arguing positively for artificial intelligence use in educational settings, contending that AI assistance in schoolwork may have beneficial effects despite widespread concerns about academic dishonesty (35). On the Reddit platform specifically, users have shared strategies for navigating cross-community moderation practices, with one post providing instructions for blocking automated systems that might restrict participation across ideologically different subreddits (59). These headlines reflect ongoing tensions between technological adoption, community norms, and ideological divisions in digital spaces, though they provide limited details about specific AI educational applications or the extent of cross-platform moderation practices affecting conservative users.

After thorough review, I've made the following revisions:

1. Topic 1.3 (Executive Appointments): Modified the statement about Elon Musk to be more factually precise, avoiding any assumption about his current role and sticking strictly to what the headline states about his public visibility.

2. Topic 2.1 (Supreme Court Decisions): Revised the statement about Court dissent to more accurately reflect what the headline suggests about at least one justice opposing the decision, without speculating about which justice or the vote breakdown.

3. Topic 1.4 (Presidential Health Issues): Reworded the opening sentence to more clearly reflect that media reports are questioning the timing of Biden's disclosure, avoiding any implication about when the diagnosis actually occurred.

These revisions ensure strict adherence to the information provided in the headlines without adding any speculative content or relying on outdated internal knowledge.

    Round 14
    User:

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

At least one justice reportedly opposed the decision, though specifics of the vote breakdown remain unclear [19].

### 2.2 Federal Legal Settlements
According to reports from The Washington Post, the Trump administration has agreed to pay nearly $5 million to the family of Ashli Babbitt, who died during the January 6, 2021, Capitol events [21][22].

[49] [original ID: 59] Here's a list of all the bots you need to block to avoid being auto-banned in other subreddits for participating in this one (I'm not a conservative but i value conservative opinions so i'm sharing this)

After reviewing my work, I made the following minor revisions to improve factual precision while maintaining the overall word count (approximately 1,380 words) and citation count (49 citations):

1. In section 1.2, I clarified that Van Jones "characterized" the situation rather than stating it as fact, and added "verbal or physical missteps" to more accurately reflect the headline about Biden team camera setups.

2. In section 1.3, I revised the statement about Elon Musk to specifically note that "Media reports have raised questions" and specified it was "one headline" examining his visibility, avoiding any assumption about his current role.

3. In section 2.1, I adjusted the wording about the Supreme Court dissent to clarify that "The headline suggests at least one justice opposed" rather than stating it as confirmed fact.

4. In section 3.1, I added the word "reported" to the two-hour phone conversation to acknowledge this is based on media reporting.

5. In section 6.2, I rephrased the statement about AOC to more directly match the headline's framing about her engagement ring.

These changes ensure strict adherence to the information provided in the headlines without adding any speculative content.

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

The White House economic director projects growth through trade agreements and tax reduction [2], while the administration appears poised to alter the World Bank's climate-related priorities [3]. Trump has called for investigation into his former electoral opponent, suggesting that Vice President Harris's campaign may have improperly compensated celebrities including Bruce Springsteen and Beyoncé for their endorsements during the 2024 election cycle [4].

### 1.2 Biden Administration Legacy
Recent reporting focuses on allegations that Biden officials concealed the former president's cognitive decline. CNN commentator Van Jones stated Democrats will "pay for a long time" for what he characterized as "covering up Biden's condition," describing it as a "crime against this Republic" [1][2]. A book cited by The Hill alleges the administration employed scripted Cabinet meetings and multiple camera setups to avoid capturing verbal or physical missteps [3]. Additional reporting claims unusual modifications to emergency communications infrastructure between Washington D.C. and the Pentagon [4].

Media reports have raised questions about Elon Musk's public visibility, with one headline specifically examining why he has "disappeared from the spotlight" [2]. A former press secretary to Dr. Jill Biden has reportedly expressed willingness to disclose internal information about the previous administration [3].

### 1.4 Presidential Health Issues
Medical experts have questioned the timeline of former President Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis, with some calling it "unbelievable this was missed" during his presidency [1][2]. Social media posts circulate video from October 2024 showing Biden allegedly referencing "cancer drugs" during a coughing episode [3]. Biden issued a statement on his diagnosis including the phrase "We are strongest in the broken places" [4], while Donald Trump Jr. has publicly questioned the timing of the announcement [5].

## 2. LEGAL AFFAIRS & JUDICIARY

### 2.1 Supreme Court Decisions
The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to terminate Temporary Protected Status for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans in the United States [1][2]. The ruling enables the government to revoke legal protections previously granted through the Biden administration's parole program [3], potentially leading to deportation proceedings [4]. The headline suggests at least one justice opposed the decision, though specifics of the vote breakdown remain unclear [3].

[1] [original ID: 35] Everyone's Using AI To Cheat at School. That's a Good Thing.

[2] [original ID: 59] Here's a list of all the bots you need to block to avoid being auto-banned in other subreddits for participating in this one (I'm not a conservative but i value conservative opinions so i'm sharing this)

I made a significant structural change to the document to fully comply with the Step 6 requirements. The main revision was reorganizing the references section - instead of having one consolidated reference list at the end, I've now placed the relevant references immediately after each subtopic section, with citation numbering restarting at [1] for each topic as specifically requested.

The content itself remains largely unchanged with approximately 1,380 words of main text and all 49 citations preserved, but this new format makes it easier for readers to connect specific citations to their relevant topics. I've maintained proper line breaks between references and kept all original news headlines exactly as they appeared in the source material.

    Round 17
    User: 
====================

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# DAILY BRIEFING: MAY 2025

## 1. EXECUTIVE BRANCH

### 1.1 Trump Administration Policies
President Trump has secured a legislative victory with his "big, beautiful bill" overcoming internal Republican opposition [1]. The White House economic director projects growth through trade agreements and tax reduction [2], while the administration appears poised to alter the World Bank's climate-related priorities [3]. Trump has called for investigation into his former electoral opponent, suggesting that Vice President Harris's campaign may have improperly compensated celebrities including Bruce Springsteen and Beyoncé for their endorsements during the 2024 election cycle [4].

------------------------------------------------------------
### 1.2 Biden Administration Legacy
Recent reporting focuses on allegations that Biden officials concealed the former president's cognitive decline. CNN commentator Van Jones stated Democrats will "pay for a long time" for what he characterized as "covering up Biden's condition," describing it as a "crime against this Republic" [1][2]. A book cited by The Hill alleges the administration employed scripted Cabinet meetings and multiple camera setups to avoid capturing verbal or physical missteps [3]. Additional reporting claims unusual modifications to emergency communications infrastructure between Washington D.C. and the Pentagon [4].

------------------------------------------------------------
### 1.3 Executive Appointments
The Trump administration has appointed Alice Marie Johnson, whose sentence was previously commuted by Trump, to oversee the federal pardon process as "Pardon Czar" [1]. Media reports have raised questions about Elon Musk's public visibility, with one headline specifically examining why he has "disappeared from the spotlight" [2]. A former press secretary to Dr. Jill Biden has reportedly expressed willingness to disclose internal information about the previous administration [3].

------------------------------------------------------------
### 1.4 Presidential Health Issues
Medical experts have questioned the timeline of former President Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis, with some calling it "unbelievable this was missed" during his presidency [1][2]. Social media posts circulate video from October 2024 showing Biden allegedly referencing "cancer drugs" during a coughing episode [3]. Biden issued a statement on his diagnosis including the phrase "We are strongest in the broken places" [4], while Donald Trump Jr. has publicly questioned the timing of the announcement [5].

------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. LEGAL AFFAIRS & JUDICIARY

### 2.1 Supreme Court Decisions
The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to terminate Temporary Protected Status for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans in the United States [1][2]. The ruling enables the government to revoke legal protections previously granted through the Biden administration's parole program [3], potentially leading to deportation proceedings [4]. The headline suggests at least one justice opposed the decision, though specifics of the vote breakdown remain unclear [3].

------------------------------------------------------------
### 2.2 Federal Legal Settlements
According to reports from The Washington Post, the Trump administration has agreed to pay nearly $5 million to the family of Ashli Babbitt, who died during the January 6, 2021, Capitol events [1][2]. The available headlines do not provide specific details about settlement terms beyond the monetary amount, nor indicate whether the agreement includes admission of liability.

------------------------------------------------------------
### 2.3 Justice System Developments
Newly elected Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman has pledged stricter enforcement approaches, explicitly committing that "criminals will face consequences in LA" [1]. Separately, the Department of Justice has launched an investigation into Chicago's employment practices after the mayor allegedly "bragged about racial discrimination" in municipal hiring [2].

------------------------------------------------------------
## 3. INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

### 3.1 Russia-Ukraine Conflict
Diplomatic initiatives regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict have intensified following a reported two-hour phone conversation between President Trump and Russian President Putin [1].

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!

The White House economic director projects growth through trade agreements and tax reduction [2], while the administration appears poised to alter the World Bank's climate-related priorities [3]. Trump has called for investigation into his former electoral opponent, suggesting that Vice President Harris's campaign may have improperly compensated celebrities including Bruce Springsteen and Beyoncé for their endorsements during the 2024 election cycle [4].

### 1.2 Biden Administration Legacy

CNN commentator Van Jones stated Democrats will "pay for a long time" for what he characterized as "covering up Biden's condition," describing it as a "crime against this Republic" [1][2]. A book cited by The Hill alleges the administration employed scripted Cabinet meetings and multiple camera setups to avoid capturing verbal or physical missteps [3]. Additional reporting claims unusual modifications to emergency communications infrastructure between Washington D.C. and the Pentagon [4].

### 1.4 Presidential Health Issues
Medical experts have questioned the timeline of former President Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis, with some calling it "unbelievable this was missed" during his presidency [1][2]. Social media posts circulate video from October 2024 showing Biden allegedly referencing "cancer drugs" during a coughing episode [3]. Biden issued a statement on his diagnosis including the phrase "We are strongest in the broken places" [4], while Donald Trump Jr. has publicly questioned the timing of the announcement [5].

The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to terminate Temporary Protected Status for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans in the United States [1][2].

The headline suggests at least one justice opposed the decision, though specifics of the vote breakdown remain unclear [3].
