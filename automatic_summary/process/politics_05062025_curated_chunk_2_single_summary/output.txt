The Atlantic highlights "Elon Musk's Most Alarming Power Grab" [1] in his role heading the Department of Government Efficiency. Salon characterizes Trump's first 100 days as unusually aggressive in "A free fall not seen in modern history": 100 days of destruction. Trump has been more aggressive in his efforts to destroy democracy than any other autocrat in recent decades [2]. Reports indicate Republicans have remained silent following Trump's refusal to commit to upholding the Constitution [3]. His approval ratings show mixed signals, with Newsweek reporting potential vulnerability with "Donald Trump's Approval Rating is Showing Cracks in His Base" [4], while conservative-leaning Newsmax highlights that Trump has "Rasmussen: Trump Bumps Up to 50 Percent Approval" [5].

### 1.2 Executive Actions and Presidential Communication
Trump's executive actions have sparked controversy, including the potential reopening of Alcatraz [1] and an order critics say will "turbocharge police violence" [2]. His communication patterns reveal a continued focus on his predecessor, with "Biden" among his most frequently used words [3].
