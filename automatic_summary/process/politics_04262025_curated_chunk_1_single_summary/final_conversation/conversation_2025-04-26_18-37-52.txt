    Round 1
    User: 
====================

**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is April, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines and begin the detailed analytical workflow. Once you provide the news data, I'll start with Step 1: defining the categories of news based on the content from r/politics. I understand the context is April 2025 with President Trump and Elon Musk's DOGE department expanding executive power, and my task is to create an objective briefing for both Democratic and Republican congressional leadership.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

**Revisions Made:**
1. Reorganized topic placement to ensure more logical grouping of related issues
2. Added "Political Climate and Democracy Concerns" to capture authoritarianism concerns
3. Simplified some topic titles for clarity while ensuring they encompass all relevant articles
4. Rebalanced topics to better distribute the news articles
5. Created clearer distinctions between categories with potential overlap


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Each article has now been uniquely classified by first its Area and then the most fitting Topic as defined in Step 1.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 5
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the updated file “step2_categorized.txt” with all articles grouped by Area and Topic. I have double‐checked that every article (all 80 unique records) appears once and only once, and I have ordered articles within each topic by their original ascending ID order. The final file is as follows:

Revisions Made:
1. I reorganized the previously flat list into a two-tier hierarchical structure (Area → Topic → Article), ensuring that every JSON line is uniquely placed in its best-fitting category.
2. I verified that each of the 80 records appears exactly once under the proper Area and Topic.
3. Within each Topic, I sorted the articles in ascending order by their IDs to preserve the original reporting order.
4. I removed the bracket headers from each line, leaving only the JSON representation under each hierarchy header.

This completes the step2_categorized.txt file with the revisions as requested.


====================
    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant: 
====================

Revisions and Verification:
1. I re-examined each hierarchical grouping to confirm that all 80 unique records are included once and only once.
2. I verified that each article is sorted in ascending order by its ID within its topic.
3. No records were missing or duplicated in multiple categories.
4. The overall structure remains a two-tier hierarchy (Area → Topic) with the JSON lines listed under their appropriate topics.

This revised file ensures complete, unique, and exhaustive coverage of all records.

    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete step3.txt file. In what follows, every article’s JSON record has been augmented with an "importance" key (placed immediately after "title") with a score from 1 to 10 according to our consistent criteria. In addition, each Topic and Area header now shows an overall importance score (in parentheses), computed from both the perceived significance of the subject matter and the aggregation of its constituent reports.

Explanation:
1. Each individual article’s "importance" score reflects the reliability of its source as well as the clarity and substance of its title.
2. Each topic’s importance was determined by the centrality of its issue alongside the accumulated weight of its constituent reports.
3. Each area’s overall importance considers its thematic resonance in the current political crisis and the number and significance of stories reported under it.

This completes Step 3 with the importance scores fully integrated into the document.

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised step3.txt file with updated scores. The only changes made were in Area 3, Topic 3.2 (“Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Actions”). In this topic I judged that the new DOGE department is a central instrument in Trump’s power grab and deserves a somewhat higher topic importance. Accordingly, I increased the topic’s overall score from 7 to 8 and raised the individual score for the second article (id 39) from 6 to 7, while keeping the other scores unchanged.

This completes the sorting step (Step 4) with areas, topics, and articles arranged by descending importance while preserving original order in the event of ties.


====================
    Round 10
    User: 
====================

**First Check After Step 4**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes and produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 10
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised step4.txt with corrections made. The main revisions were:

1. In Area 1, Topic 1.1 the article with id 66 (importance: 7) is now placed before the article with id 30 (importance: 6) so that all 7‑point articles come before the 6‑point article.
2. In Area 1, Topic 1.2 the article with id 12 (importance: 6) is now placed before the article with id 1 (importance: 5).
3. In Area 6, Topic 6.4 the wrong entries (id 68 and id 65) were removed and the missing articles from the original data (ids 10, 46, and 51) were included. The articles in Topic 6.4 are now sorted by descending importance as follows:
 – Group importance 8: id 58;
 – Group importance 7: id 7 then id 61 (preserving their original order);
 – Group importance 6: id 45, then id 59, then id 64, then id 79 (in original order);
 – Group importance 5: id 10, then id 46, then id 51.
4. All other areas, topics, and article orders have been verified and adjusted to preserve descending importance (with original order preserved for ties).

Revision Summary:
• In Area 1, Topic 1.1 the order was adjusted so that the 7‑point articles (ids 2 and 66) precede the 6‑point article (id 30), preserving the original tie order.
• In Area 1, Topic 1.2 the 6‑point article (id 12) now comes before the 5‑point article (id 1).
• In Area 6, Topic 6.4 only the original 10 articles (ids 7, 10, 45, 46, 51, 58, 59, 61, 64, 79) are included and sorted into four groups by importance (8, 7, 6, then 5), preserving original order within each group.
• All other sorting orders for areas, topics, and articles have been re‑checked and are now correct.

This completes the revised Step 4 output.

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 11
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the new step4.txt with re‐numbered area and topic headings. All records are covered uniquely and exhaustively, and the content and order from the previous output have been preserved while only changing the numbering to an ascending scheme based on their appearance in the document.

Revision Summary:
• Re-numbered all areas in ascending order (Area 1 through Area 7) following the order of appearance in the previous output.
• Within each area, re-numbered the topics sequentially (e.g., Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2; Topic 2.1, Topic 2.2, etc.) while preserving their original order and content.
• Verified that all records are included uniquely and exhaustively without altering any of the original information.

This completes the revised Step 4 output with new ascending numbering.

====================

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Area 1: Immigration and Enforcement (importance: 9)

  Topic 1.1: Deportation of US Citizens (importance: 9)
  
Multiple judicial and civil rights sources report U.S. citizens, predominantly children, have been deported during recent immigration enforcement operations. A federal judge has raised serious concerns about a 2-year-old U.S. citizen who "appears to have been deported with no meaningful process" [11, 29, 57]. The American Civil Liberties Union documents that three U.S. citizen children were "held incommunicado" prior to their deportation [17]. Additional cases include the deportation of a U.S. citizen child with cancer [37] and a Tampa woman deported to Cuba who was separated from her one-year-old child and U.S. citizen husband [60]. These cases collectively indicate systematic procedural failures in deportation processes that are affecting U.S. citizens despite their legal right to remain in the country.

  Topic 1.2: Judicial Response to Immigration Enforcement (importance: 7)

A growing conflict between judicial officials and immigration enforcement authorities has emerged, with accusations from both sides. Attorney General Bondi has publicly criticized judges for allegedly helping undocumented immigrants avoid arrest, declaring that "no one is above the law" [35]. Simultaneously, a Trump-appointed judge is demanding explanations regarding the deportation of a 2-year-old U.S. citizen [48]. In Wisconsin, federal authorities have arrested a judge for allegedly assisting an undocumented immigrant - accused of assaulting someone by "punching victim 30 times" - in evading Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents [13]. These developments highlight the escalating tension between judicial independence and the administration's immigration enforcement priorities.

Area 2: Executive Power and Governance (importance: 9)

  Topic 2.1: Legal Challenges to Executive Actions (importance: 9)

The judiciary has emerged as a significant check on executive actions, with multiple court rulings blocking presidential orders. A federal judge has halted President Trump's order that would have ended collective bargaining rights for many federal workers [33, 36]. Simultaneously, tension between the executive branch and judiciary has intensified following the arrest of a Wisconsin judge, which Senator Sanders characterized as being about "unchecked power" rather than immigration enforcement [18]. The Intercept reports that judges who have ruled against aspects of the administration's deportation policies are facing arrest, characterizing it as a response to courts "slowing down Trump's fascist deportation regime" [31]. These developments represent a significant constitutional confrontation between the executive branch and judiciary over the scope of presidential authority.

  Topic 2.2: Presidential Authority and Orders (importance: 8)

Associated Press reports that critics are raising concerns about potential misuse of governmental power by the administration [9]. The reporting indicates that some observers believe President Trump is "weaponizing government" specifically in actions targeting a judge and a Democratic fundraising website. This allegation suggests scrutiny of how executive authority is being exercised against perceived political or institutional opponents. However, the headline provides limited details about the specific actions taken or their legal justification.

  Topic 2.3: Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Actions (importance: 8)

Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is expanding operations in ways that have raised transparency and civil liberties concerns. Rolling Stone reports that Musk's allies required Federal Aviation Administration staff to sign non-disclosure agreements regarding an unspecified project [38]. The Daily Beast alleges DOGE is constructing what they term a "deportation machine" utilizing sensitive personal data [39]. Techdirt claims DOGE's efforts to identify supposed censorship have resulted in terminating legitimate anti-censorship research [49]. These reports highlight questions about DOGE's operational methods, transparency requirements, data usage practices, and the scope of its authority within the federal government.

Area 3: Domestic Politics and Public Opinion (importance: 9)

  Topic 3.1: Presidential Approval and Polling (importance: 8)

Multiple polls indicate President Trump is facing significant approval challenges across diverse demographics. A New York Times/Siena poll finds voters perceive Trump's use of power as "overreaching" [16], with his overall ratings characterized as "dismal" [28]. Support appears to be declining among independent voters, with the New Republic reporting Trump is "suddenly bleeding independents" [15]. Even within his party base, an AP-NORC poll shows only about half of Republicans believe Trump is focusing on the right priorities [67, 77]. The New York Times has published an analysis examining four perspectives on these widely reported weak poll numbers [44]. These consistent findings across multiple polls from different organizations suggest a broad-based erosion of public confidence in the administration's direction and methods.

This move is characterized by some experts as China "caving" to President Trump's trade war strategy [2]. However, media assessments diverge, with CNN warning that Americans who haven't yet felt the trade war's economic impact should "get ready" for potential consequences [66]. Chinese social media reportedly presents a contradictory narrative, mocking Trump with claims he "chickened out" on trade negotiations [30]. These reports highlight the complex and fluid nature of U.S.-China trade relations, with different stakeholders offering contrasting interpretations of recent developments.

Simultaneously, The Guardian reports that tourism to the United States has declined significantly, with visitor numbers dropping 11.6% in March. This trend is attributed to deportation policies and tariffs making the U.S. "a less appealing destination" [80]. The report suggests this decline could cost the U.S. economy "billions" in lost revenue. These developments highlight how domestic economic and immigration policies are having complex economic consequences for international relations and industries dependent on global mobility.

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title; [2] [original ID: xx] title; [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to add a "\n\n" between  lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

## 1. IMMIGRATION AND ENFORCEMENT

### 1.1 Deportation of US Citizens

Multiple news sources report U.S. citizens, predominantly children, have been deported in recent immigration enforcement operations. A federal judge has highlighted a case where a 2-year-old U.S. citizen "appears to have been deported with no meaningful process" [1][2][3]. The ACLU documents three U.S. citizen children who were "held incommunicado" prior to deportation [4]. Additional cases include a U.S. citizen child with cancer [5] and a Tampa woman separated from her one-year-old child and U.S. citizen husband after being deported to Cuba [6]. These cases indicate procedural failures affecting citizens despite their legal right to remain in the country.

Conflict between judicial officials and immigration authorities has escalated. Attorney General Bondi criticized judges, stating "no one is above the law" regarding those allegedly helping undocumented immigrants evade arrest [1]. A Trump-appointed judge is demanding explanations about the 2-year-old citizen's deportation [2]. In Wisconsin, federal authorities arrested a judge "for allegedly helping illegal migrant accused of punching victim 30 times evade ICE agents" [3].

## 2. EXECUTIVE POWER AND GOVERNANCE

### 2.1 Legal Challenges to Executive Actions

The judiciary has blocked several executive actions through court rulings. A federal judge halted President Trump's order that would have ended collective bargaining rights for many federal workers [1][2]. The Intercept reports judges who ruled against deportation policies are facing arrest, claiming they are "slowing down Trump's fascist deportation regime" [3]. The Associated Press reports critics see President Trump "weaponizing government in targeting of judge and Democratic fundraising site" [4].

Support appears to be declining among independent voters, with the New Republic reporting Trump is "suddenly bleeding independents" [3]. Even within his party base, AP-NORC polling shows only about half of Republicans believe Trump is focusing on the right priorities [4][5]. The consistent findings across multiple polls suggest a broad erosion of public confidence in the administration's direction and methods.

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title; [2] [original ID: xx] title; [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to add a "\n\n" between  lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# APRIL 2025 CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP BRIEFING

## 1. IMMIGRATION AND ENFORCEMENT

### 1.1 Deportation of US Citizens

Multiple news sources report U.S. citizens, predominantly children, have been deported in recent immigration enforcement operations. A federal judge has highlighted a case where a 2-year-old U.S. citizen "appears to have been deported with no meaningful process" [1][2]. The ACLU documents three U.S. citizen children who were "held incommunicado" prior to deportation [3]. Additional cases include a U.S. citizen child with cancer [4] and a Tampa woman separated from her one-year-old child and U.S. citizen husband after being deported to Cuba [5].

### 1.2 Judicial Response to Immigration Enforcement

Conflict between judicial officials and immigration authorities has escalated. Attorney General Bondi criticized judges, stating "no one is above the law" regarding those allegedly helping undocumented immigrants evade arrest [1]. A Trump-appointed judge is demanding explanations about the 2-year-old citizen's deportation [2]. In Wisconsin, federal authorities arrested a judge "for allegedly helping illegal migrant accused of punching victim 30 times evade ICE agents" [3]. Senator Sanders characterized the Wisconsin judge's arrest as being about "unchecked power" rather than immigration enforcement [4].

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL; [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# APRIL 2025 CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP BRIEFING

## 1. IMMIGRATION AND ENFORCEMENT

### 1.1 Deportation of US Citizens

Multiple news sources report U.S. citizens, predominantly children, have been deported in recent immigration enforcement operations. A federal judge has highlighted a case where a 2-year-old U.S. citizen "appears to have been deported with no meaningful process" [1][2]. The ACLU documents three U.S. citizen children who were "held incommunicado" prior to deportation [3]. Additional cases include a U.S. citizen child with cancer [4] and a Tampa woman separated from her one-year-old child and U.S. citizen husband after being deported to Cuba [5].

### 1.2 Judicial Response to Immigration Enforcement

Conflict between judicial officials and immigration authorities has escalated. Attorney General Bondi criticized judges, stating "no one is above the law" regarding those allegedly helping undocumented immigrants evade arrest [1]. A Trump-appointed judge is demanding explanations about the 2-year-old citizen's deportation [2]. In Wisconsin, federal authorities arrested a judge "for allegedly helping illegal migrant accused of punching victim 30 times evade ICE agents" [3]. Senator Sanders characterized the Wisconsin judge's arrest as being about "unchecked power" rather than immigration enforcement [4].

[1] 'No one is above the law': AG Bondi blasts judges accused of helping undocumented immigrants evade arrest, https://abcnews.go.com/amp/US/judge-hannah-dugan-arrested-fbi-allegedly-helping-undocumented/story?id=121161497;

It has everything to do with his moving this country toward authoritarianism.", https://www.commondreams.org/news/hannah-dugan-milwaukee

## 2. EXECUTIVE POWER AND GOVERNANCE

### 2.1 Legal Challenges to Executive Actions

The judiciary has blocked several executive actions through court rulings. A federal judge halted President Trump's order that would have ended collective bargaining rights for many federal workers [1]. The Intercept reports judges who ruled against deportation policies are facing arrest, claiming they are "slowing down Trump's fascist deportation regime" [2]. The Associated Press reports critics see President Trump "weaponizing government in targeting of judge and Democratic fundraising site" [3].

### 2.2 Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Actions

Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is expanding operations in ways that raise transparency and civil liberties concerns. Rolling Stone reports Musk's allies required Federal Aviation Administration staff to sign non-disclosure agreements for an unspecified project [1]. The Daily Beast alleges DOGE is constructing a "deportation machine" utilizing sensitive personal data [2]. Techdirt claims DOGE's efforts to identify supposed censorship have resulted in terminating legitimate anti-censorship research [3].

## 3. DOMESTIC POLITICS AND PUBLIC OPINION

### 3.1 Presidential Approval and Polling

Multiple polls indicate President Trump faces approval challenges across diverse demographics. A New York Times/Siena poll finds voters perceive Trump's use of power as "overreaching" [1] with his overall ratings characterized as "dismal" [2]. Support appears to be declining among independent voters, with the New Republic reporting Trump is "suddenly bleeding independents" [3]. AP-NORC polling shows only about half of Republicans believe Trump is focusing on the right priorities [4].

### 4.1 U.S.-China Trade Relations

Recent developments in U.S.-China trade show mixed signals. CNN reports China has rolled back its 125% retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S.-made semiconductors [1]. Fox Business characterizes this as China "caving" to Trump's trade war strategy [2]. However, other assessments diverge, with CNN warning Americans who haven't yet felt the trade war's impact should "get ready" [3]. Chinese social media reportedly presents a contradictory narrative, claiming Trump "chickened out" on trade negotiations [4].

# APRIL 2025 CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP BRIEFING

## 1. IMMIGRATION AND ENFORCEMENT

### 1.1 Deportation of US Citizens

Multiple news sources report U.S. citizens, predominantly children, have been deported in recent immigration enforcement operations. A federal judge has highlighted a case where a 2-year-old U.S. citizen "appears to have been deported with no meaningful process" [1][2]. The ACLU documents three U.S. citizen children who were "held incommunicado" prior to deportation [3]. Additional cases include a U.S. citizen child with cancer [4] and a Tampa woman separated from her one-year-old child and U.S. citizen husband after being deported to Cuba [5].

### 1.2 Judicial Response to Immigration Enforcement

Conflict between judicial officials and immigration authorities has escalated. Attorney General Bondi criticized judges, stating "no one is above the law" regarding those allegedly helping undocumented immigrants evade arrest [1]. A Trump-appointed judge is demanding explanations about the 2-year-old citizen's deportation [2]. In Wisconsin, federal authorities arrested a judge "for allegedly helping illegal migrant accused of punching victim 30 times evade ICE agents" [3]. Senator Sanders characterized the Wisconsin judge's arrest as being about "unchecked power" rather than immigration enforcement [4].

## 2. EXECUTIVE POWER AND GOVERNANCE

### 2.1 Legal Challenges to Executive Actions

The judiciary has blocked several executive actions through court rulings. A federal judge halted President Trump's order that would have ended collective bargaining rights for many federal workers [1]. The Intercept reports judges who ruled against deportation policies are facing arrest, claiming they are "slowing down Trump's fascist deportation regime" [2]. The Associated Press reports critics see President Trump "weaponizing government in targeting of judge and Democratic fundraising site" [3].

### 2.2 Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Actions

Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is expanding operations in ways that raise transparency and civil liberties concerns. Rolling Stone reports Musk's allies required Federal Aviation Administration staff to sign non-disclosure agreements for an unspecified project [1]. The Daily Beast alleges DOGE is constructing a "deportation machine" utilizing sensitive personal data [2]. Techdirt claims DOGE's efforts to identify supposed censorship have resulted in terminating legitimate anti-censorship research [3].

## 3. DOMESTIC POLITICS AND PUBLIC OPINION

### 3.1 Presidential Approval and Polling

Multiple polls indicate President Trump faces approval challenges across diverse demographics. A New York Times/Siena poll finds voters perceive Trump's use of power as "overreaching" [1] with his overall ratings characterized as "dismal" [2]. Support appears to be declining among independent voters, with the New Republic reporting Trump is "suddenly bleeding independents" [3]. AP-NORC polling shows only about half of Republicans believe Trump is focusing on the right priorities [4].

### 3.2 Political Climate and Future Elections

The political atmosphere has grown increasingly tense. Former Yale classmates of Treasury Secretary Bessent warn he risks enabling a "descent into fascism" [1]. The Guardian reports "everyone's scared" ahead of the White House Correspondents' Dinner [2]. Unusual official behavior has been reported, including claims that Pete Hegseth is "screaming at generals about polygraph tests" [3].

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Immigration and Enforcement

### 1.1 Deportation of US Citizens

Multiple news sources report U.S. citizens, predominantly children, have been deported in recent immigration enforcement operations. A federal judge has highlighted a case where a 2-year-old U.S. citizen "appears to have been deported with no meaningful process" [1][2]. The ACLU documents three U.S. citizen children who were "held incommunicado" prior to deportation [3]. Additional cases include a U.S. citizen child with cancer [4] and a Tampa woman separated from her one-year-old child and U.S. citizen husband after being deported to Cuba [5].

### 1.2 Judicial Response to Immigration Enforcement

Conflict between judicial officials and immigration authorities has escalated. Attorney General Bondi criticized judges, stating "no one is above the law" regarding those allegedly helping undocumented immigrants evade arrest [1]. A Trump-appointed judge is demanding explanations about the 2-year-old citizen's deportation [2]. In Wisconsin, federal authorities arrested a judge "for allegedly helping illegal migrant accused of punching victim 30 times evade ICE agents" [3]. Senator Sanders characterized the Wisconsin judge's arrest as being about "unchecked power" rather than immigration enforcement [4].

## 2. Executive Power and Governance

### 2.1 Legal Challenges to Executive Actions

The judiciary has blocked several executive actions through court rulings. A federal judge halted President Trump's order that would have ended collective bargaining rights for many federal workers [1]. The Intercept reports judges who ruled against deportation policies are facing arrest, claiming they are "slowing down Trump's fascist deportation regime" [2]. The Associated Press reports critics see President Trump "weaponizing government in targeting of judge and Democratic fundraising site" [3].

### 2.2 Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Actions

Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is expanding operations in ways that raise transparency and civil liberties concerns. Rolling Stone reports Musk's allies required Federal Aviation Administration staff to sign non-disclosure agreements for an unspecified project [1]. The Daily Beast alleges DOGE is constructing a "deportation machine" utilizing sensitive personal data [2].

Multiple polls indicate President Trump faces approval challenges across diverse demographics.

### 3.2 Political Climate and Future Elections

The political atmosphere has grown increasingly tense. Former Yale classmates of Treasury Secretary Bessent warn he risks enabling a "descent into fascism" [1]. The Guardian reports "everyone's scared" ahead of the White House Correspondents' Dinner [2]. Unusual official behavior has been reported, including claims that Pete Hegseth is "screaming at generals about polygraph tests" [3].

Speculation about future elections is intensifying, with the Trump Store selling "Trump 2028" hats [4], which ABC News describes as a "tease that the president could again run for office" [5]. NBC News reports that "Trump's third-term talk" is having a chilling effect on potential Republican candidates for 2028 [6].

## 4. Economic Policy and Trade Relations

### 4.1 U.S.-China Trade Relations

Recent developments in U.S.-China trade show mixed signals. CNN reports China has rolled back its 125% retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S.-made semiconductors [1]. Fox Business characterizes this as China "caving" to Trump's trade war strategy [2]. However, other assessments diverge, with CNN warning Americans who haven't yet felt the trade war's impact should "get ready" [3].

Reuters reports Trump's tariffs are causing "political pain" for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and other European far-right leaders [3].
