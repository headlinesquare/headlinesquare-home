## 4. Political Dynamics and Party Politics

### 4.1 Musk-Trump Relationship Tensions

Significant tensions have emerged between Elon Musk and Republican leadership. Musk has labeled a Trump tax break bill an "abomination," with GOP senators reportedly avoiding questions about this criticism [1]. The friction has intensified with Musk escalating attacks on what's called a "Megabill," reportedly leaving Trump "furious" [2]. Republicans are no longer following Musk's lead according to one report [3]. Speaker Mike Johnson was allegedly "ghosted" by Musk following what one outlet described as a "deranged posting spree," with House Republicans concerned after Musk threatened to "fire them all in the midterms" [4].

A federal health agency has stated that emergency abortion care guidance no longer reflects the current administration's policy [4]. Louisiana lawmakers have rejected proposals to add rape exceptions to the state's abortion ban [5].
