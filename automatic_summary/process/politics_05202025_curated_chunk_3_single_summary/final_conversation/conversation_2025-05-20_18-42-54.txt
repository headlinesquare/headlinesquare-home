**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

====================Input File End======================

---

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines for the Reddit news posts. Once you provide them, I'll begin the structured workflow to create a comprehensive Daily Briefing for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress, following the 8-step process you've outlined.

I understand that I should rely solely on the information provided in the headlines and background materials, maintaining factual accuracy without speculation. I'll process the news objectively despite any potential bias in the source subreddit, and I'll be careful about political figures' current positions given that my internal knowledge is outdated.

Please provide the JSONL lines at your convenience.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

    User: 
====================

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.


====================
    Round 3
    Assistant: 
====================

# step1.txt (Revised)

Based on careful review of the provided headlines, I've created a more streamlined categorization system:

Area 1: Trump Administration & Executive Actions
    Topic 1.1: Presidential Statements & Policies
    Topic 1.2: Cabinet & Appointments
    Topic 1.3: DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) Initiatives
    Topic 1.4: White House Operations & Management

Area 2: National Security & International Relations
    Topic 2.1: Golden Dome Defense Project
    Topic 2.2: Military Affairs & Defense Programs
    Topic 2.3: Foreign Policy & International Engagement
    Topic 2.4: Border Security Strategy

Area 3: Immigration & Deportation Policies
    Topic 3.1: Deportation Actions & Procedures
    Topic 3.2: Migrant Rights & Legal Challenges
    Topic 3.3: Immigration Enforcement Funding
    Topic 3.4: Administration Statements on Immigration

Area 4: Healthcare & Public Health
    Topic 4.1: COVID-19 Policies & Vaccines
    Topic 4.2: Healthcare Access & Reform
    Topic 4.3: Health Agency Actions & Regulations
    Topic 4.4: Medical Statements & Controversies

Area 5: Economy, Budget & Taxation
    Topic 5.1: National Debt & Economic Outlook
    Topic 5.2: Tax Policy & Legislation
    Topic 5.3: Federal Spending & Budget Bills
    Topic 5.4: Economic Impact Assessments

Area 6: Congress & Judicial System
    Topic 6.1: Legislative Initiatives & Votes
    Topic 6.2: Congressional Hearings & Testimonies
    Topic 6.3: Supreme Court Rulings
    Topic 6.4: Legal Challenges & Constitutional Issues

Area 7: Social Policy & Cultural Affairs
    Topic 7.1: State Legislation & Policies
    Topic 7.2: Civil Rights & LGBTQ+ Issues
    Topic 7.3: Education & Academic Institutions
    Topic 7.4: Political Culture & Public Discourse

**Revisions Made:**
- Reduced from 8 areas to 7 for better cognitive organization
- Placed related topics closer together (e.g., moved border security closer to national security)
- Combined Congress and Judicial System into one area since they're closely related branches of government
- Made topic descriptions more specific and distinct
- Organized areas to flow more logically from executive actions to societal impacts


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

This completes Step 2: Every article from the JSONL list is now uniquely clustered into one Area and one Topic under our hierarchical two-tier structure.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 5
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the new version of step2_categorized.txt. All articles are now organized into the seven Areas (each with its own Topics) and within each Topic the articles are sorted in ascending order by their “id.” I reviewed each record to ensure that every JSON line appears exactly once and is placed under one unique Area/Topic.

────────────────────────────────────────────
Revisions and Explanation:
1. I reorganized the records into a clear two-tier hierarchy (Area & Topic) rather than leaving the header on each JSON line.
2. All articles are now sorted under their appropriate Area and Topic groups.
3. Within each Topic, the articles are sorted in ascending order by their “id” to maintain a consistent order.
4. I double-checked that every article appears exactly once and that no records are missing.

This completes Step 2: All articles from the original JSON lines are now uniquely and exhaustively categorized.


====================
    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised step2_categorized.txt file. I carefully cross‐checked every single record (IDs 195 through 291) to ensure that each JSON line appears exactly once and is assigned uniquely into one Area/Topic. In doing so, I noted a few articles with nearly identical titles (for example, the three records “US immigration authorities appear to have begun deporting migrants to South Sudan…” in Topic 3.1). They are treated as distinct records because they are separate JSON lines. No article was left unassigned or assigned to more than one category.

────────────────────────────────────────────
Revisions and Explanation:
1. I re-verified that every record from IDs 195 through 291 is present exactly once. The totals by area now add to 97 overall.
2. I checked that no JSON line appears in more than one Area/Topic.
3. I confirmed that articles with similar titles (such as the three entries on deportation from South Sudan) remain uniquely assigned under Topic 3.1.
4. I also ensured that within each Topic the records are sorted by ascending ID.

No substantive misassignments were found after the second independent check. The file now reflects every record uniquely and exhaustively under the established two-tier hierarchy.

This completes the second check after Step 2 with the revised file above.


====================
    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete “step3.txt” file with importance scores inserted at all three levels (articles, topics, and areas). (All JSON objects now include an "importance" field immediately after the "title" value.) I have applied a consistent scale from 1 (least important) to 10 (most important) based on source reputation, clarity and news relevance while avoiding saturating the top end. Please review the final document:

Revisions Explanation:
1. Each article now includes an "importance" field (from 1 to 10) placed immediately after its "title" attribute.
2. I assigned scores to articles based on source reputation, headline clarity, and perceived policy relevance.
3. Each topic was then given a single importance score reflecting the overall weight and consistency of its articles.
4. Finally, each area received an importance score based on the aggregate relevance of its topics.
5. Care was taken not to saturate the top end of the scale; importance 10 was reserved for only the most critical, widely impactful stories.

This “step3.txt” file now completes the scoring step.

    Round 8
    User: 
====================

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised “step3.txt” file with updated importance scores. In this revision I changed the importance for Topic 2.2 (“Military Affairs & Defense Programs”) from 7 to 8 to better reflect the weight of the Reuters report on the Pentagon’s comprehensive review. I also rechecked all article scores and topic/area scores for consistency with our criteria. No other scores needed adjustment.

**Step 4 (logic-heavy)**

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

Below is the revised “step4.txt” file with corrected sorting. In this revision I found that under Area 1 – Topic 1.3 (DOGE Initiatives) one article (id 249) was inadvertently omitted. I have now added it in the proper descending order (it should appear in the group with importance 5, after the article with importance 6 and before the one with importance 4). All other areas, topics, and articles have been rechecked and are sorted in descending order of importance while preserving original order among ties.

Revisions Explanation:
1. In Topic 1.3 (DOGE Initiatives) of Area 1, I discovered that the article with id 249 ("Gene Collier: Elon Musk, backstage clown, is leaving the stage") was missing from the sorted output. I have now inserted it in its correct position (after the article with importance 6 and before the one with importance 4).
2. I rechecked all other areas, topics, and article orderings to ensure they are sorted in descending order of importance while preserving the original order among ties.

This completes the revised Step 4 document.


====================
    Round 11
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 11
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the new step4.txt file with updated ascending numbering for areas and topics. In this revision I rechecked that every record appears exactly once and in proper order, then reassigned new area and topic numbering based solely on the order of appearance (without changing any content or sorting order). The content within each topic remains intact.

Revisions Explanation:
1. I rechecked to ensure all records from the previous step were included uniquely and exhaustively.
2. I reassigned new ascending numbering for the areas and, within each area, renumbered the topics in the order they appear. For example, the first block (previously “Area 2”) is now “Area 1” with its topics renumbered from 1.1 onward; the second block (previously “Area 1”) is now “Area 2,” and so on.
3. No change was made to the content or sorting order of articles—only the area and topic labels were renumbered.

This completes the updated step4.txt file with the required revisions.

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Area 1: National Security & International Relations [importance: 9]

Topic 1.1: Golden Dome Defense Project [importance: 9]
The Trump administration has unveiled plans for a missile defense system dubbed the "Golden Dome," with President Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announcing a $175 billion initiative for this space-based shield [247, 263]. The administration has selected a design and appointed leadership for the project [263], which earlier reports indicated would initially receive $25 billion in funding [202]. The system appears to have international implications, as Trump has stated that Canada has requested to join the missile-defense program [256, 283]. The full scope, technical specifications, and deployment timeline for this massive national security project remain unclear from the available information.

The Pentagon has initiated a "comprehensive review" into the 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan [238]. No further details about the scope, timeline, or objectives of this review are provided in the available information. The review presumably examines the events surrounding the end of America's longest war and the subsequent Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.

A Trump-Kushner hotel project in Serbia has encountered complications due to allegations of forgery [227], though specific details about the nature of the alleged forgery or its impact on U.S.-Serbian relations are not provided. In separate diplomatic matters, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has stated that Iranian proxy terrorism has not been included as part of ongoing negotiations with Iran [234]. The limited information available does not indicate what issues are being negotiated with Iran or the current status of these diplomatic discussions.

Area 2: Trump Administration & Executive Actions [importance: 8]

Topic 2.1: Presidential Statements & Policies [importance: 7]
President Trump has made several significant policy statements across multiple domains. Regarding Ukraine, he has adopted a hands-off approach, characterizing the ongoing conflict as "not my problem" [260]. On the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump has expressed views on its origins, though specific details are not provided [288]. Domestically, he has reportedly threatened a Republican representative who was exposing alleged budget misrepresentations [232] and faced accusations of corrupt self-serving actions, described by critics as the "single most corrupt, self-serving act of any President in American history" [201]. In statements about former President Biden, Trump claimed Biden has "Stage 9" cancer [221] and has taken contradictory positions on immigration, claiming Biden would "never allow" open borders despite previously blaming him for an immigration "invasion" [286]. Trump's approval rating has reportedly reached 55% according to one source [258].

Topic 2.2: DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) Initiatives [importance: 7]
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, has attempted to expand its influence beyond the executive branch, though some entities have pushed back against these efforts [264]. Musk himself has announced he will curtail his political spending, stating "I think I've done enough" and that he'll spend "a lot less" money on politics [197, 218, 261]. This apparent withdrawal has reportedly affected Republican funding expectations [216]. DOGE's actions have had concrete impacts, as evidenced in Wyoming where Humanities staff was reduced from 6 to 2 employees following a "DOGE-driven funding freeze" [275].

Topic 2.3: White House Operations & Management [importance: 6]
The White House's operational matters include President Trump's search for a replacement Air Force One, which has led to consideration of a luxury plane from Qatar [196, 278]. The administration has published notably few transcripts of Trump's public remarks [207], representing a departure from traditional transparency practices. On a more routine note, the White House celebrated Take Your Child to Work Day with a special briefing [280].

Area 3: Immigration & Deportation Policies [importance: 8]

Topic 3.1: Deportation Actions & Procedures [importance: 8]
The Trump administration's deportation procedures have come under scrutiny for both their costs and implementation methods. Migrant detentions at Guantanamo Bay reportedly cost $100,000 per person daily, according to a senator's statement [215]. Multiple sources indicate that U.S. immigration authorities have begun deporting migrants to South Sudan [253, 266, 273], with some reports specifically noting that Asian migrants were placed on these deportation flights [282]. In one individual case, the administration imposed a $1.8 million fine on a low-income migrant [265], though details about the circumstances of this fine are not provided.

Topic 3.2: Migrant Rights & Legal Challenges [importance: 7]
Immigrant rights advocates have claimed that the U.S. violated a court order by deporting migrants to South Sudan [240]. The specific nature of the court order allegedly violated is not detailed in the available information, nor are the potential legal consequences or remedies being sought.

{"id": 240, "domain": "reuters.com", "title": "Immigrant rights advocates claim US violated court order by deporting migrants to South Sudan", "importance": 7}

Topic 3.3: Administration Statements on Immigration [importance: 7]
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has drawn criticism for misstating the meaning of habeas corpus during Senate scrutiny [243, 257]. Specifically, Noem incorrectly defined the constitutional concept as "the President's right to deport people" [257, 270], prompting reactions that she "should probably know what habeas corpus is" [268]. In a related development, Senator Van Hollen criticized Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a contentious exchange over deportations and an individual identified as Abrego Garcia [279], though the specific context of this exchange is not provided.

Topic 3.4: Immigration Enforcement Funding [importance: 5]
Taxpayers in metro Phoenix continue to bear financial costs for Joe Arpaio's past immigration crackdowns [251]. The headline does not specify the amount of these ongoing costs or their specific nature, only that local taxpayers are "still footing the bill" for these previous enforcement actions.

Area 4: Healthcare & Public Health [importance: 8]

Topic 4.1: COVID-19 Policies & Vaccines [importance: 8]
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is moving to restrict access to COVID-19 vaccines, primarily limiting them to high-risk groups [195, 210]. Under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., COVID shots will reportedly only be available to people 65 and older and other high-risk individuals [248]. The FDA has indicated that COVID vaccines likely will not be available for healthy children and adults this fall [274]. These developments represent a significant shift in vaccine accessibility under the Trump administration's health policies [235].

Topic 4.2: Healthcare Access & Reform [importance: 7]
Current healthcare policy debates include arguments that healthcare access should not be tied to employment status [212], challenging the employer-based insurance model that dominates the American healthcare system. Meanwhile, Secretary Kennedy has called for healthier school meals at the same time the Trump administration has canceled a program that previously funded such initiatives [226], creating an apparent contradiction between stated goals and funding actions.

Topic 4.3: Medical Statements & Controversies [importance: 5]
Former President Biden's office has stated that his "last known" prostate cancer screening was in 2014 [285]. The headline does not provide context for why this medical information was released or its relevance to current events.

Area 5: Economy, Budget & Taxation [importance: 8]

Topic 5.1: National Debt & Economic Outlook [importance: 8]
The United States faces significant financial challenges with its national debt reaching $36 trillion, raising questions about implications and ownership of this debt [290]. Deutsche Bank analysts have warned that the U.S. economy is experiencing "death by a thousand cuts" as confidence in national debt management erodes [213, 281]. These economic concerns appear to be affecting public perception, as Trump's approval rating has reportedly declined due partly to economic worries according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll [245].

Topic 5.2: Tax Policy & Legislation [importance: 7]
President Trump's nominee to lead the Internal Revenue Service has come under scrutiny for promoting a nonexistent tax credit [220], though the specific credit in question is not identified in the headline. Adding to the controversy, a Democratic senator has claimed to possess recordings of "favors promised" by Trump's IRS pick [236], suggesting potential impropriety in the nomination process.

Topic 5.3: Economic Impact Assessments [importance: 7]
The Congressional Budget Office has released estimated budgetary effects of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" [276], though the specific projections are not detailed in the headline. In separate economic matters, fact-checkers have disputed President Trump's claim that the U.S. doesn't do "much business with Canada," noting that Canada is actually the world's top buyer of U.S. exports [252]. Additionally, experts have warned that Trump's trade war policies risk "splintering the Internet" [267], suggesting potential far-reaching economic consequences beyond traditional trade sectors.

Topic 5.4: Federal Spending & Budget Bills [importance: 6]
President Trump's budget initiatives have faced challenges, with reports indicating he "killed his own budget bill" despite urging Republicans to support it [211]. Regional tensions over federal spending have emerged, with a GOP Senator "begging for disaster aid" as FEMA reportedly "snubs another red state" [203]. Trump has allegedly stated that a "big bill" should only help GOP states, saying he doesn't "want to benefit Dem governors" [214]. This approach has prompted criticism from within his own party, with a GOP lawmaker turning against Trump after the administration denied raising the deficit by trillions [244].

The Supreme Court has ordered the Maine legislature to revoke its censure of Republican Representative Laurel Libby over her posts about a transgender student athlete [222, 291]. Libby had been censured since February 15, and the Court's ruling requires the Maine House to restore her voting rights [222, 291].

Topic 6.3: Legislative Initiatives & Votes [importance: 7]
The Senate will attempt to block California vehicle standards that would phase out gas-powered cars [225], representing federal pushback against state environmental regulations. In a rare show of unanimity, the Senate unexpectedly passed the "No Tax on Tips Act" in a unanimous vote [254, 255]. This legislation, which is now awaiting a vote on the House floor, reportedly only applies to cash tips rather than all gratuities [284], an important distinction for implementation.

Area 7: Social Policy & Cultural Affairs [importance: 7]

Topic 7.1: Political Culture & Public Discourse [importance: 7]
Current political discourse encompasses fundamental questions about American identity, with analysis indicating that American citizenship has been contested and "subject to the anti-democratic impulses of racism, suspicion, and paranoia" since the nation's founding [230]. Virginia Republicans have expressed concern about their gubernatorial candidate who "invoked slavery when criticizing DEI" [229]. Claims have emerged regarding former President Biden, with assertions that he "was unfit in 2020" [250]. In campaign strategies, Democrats are reported to be "throwing money at a problem" in efforts to counter "GOP clout online" [289]. Generational shifts in political engagement are evident as "Gen Z ditches the protest scene" [271]. Senator Bernie Sanders has reportedly declined to argue against claims that Democrats are a "threat to democracy," citing this as a reason he's "proudly independent" [199].

Educational issues include an Education Department backlog that has left nearly 2 million student loan borrowers "in limbo" [206], though the specific nature of the processing delays is not detailed. In higher education, Columbia University's acting president was "heckled with boos and shouts of 'Free Mahmoud'" during a graduation speech [217], though the headline provides no context about who Mahmoud is or why protestors were calling for this action.

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

### Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)
The Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, has attempted to expand its influence beyond the executive branch, though some targets have reportedly pushed back against these efforts [1].

Senator Bernie Sanders has declined to argue against claims that Democrats are a "threat to democracy," citing this as why he's "proudly independent" [3].

### Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)
The Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, has attempted to expand its influence beyond the executive branch, though some targets have reportedly pushed back against these efforts [1].

Revisions Made in This Step:
1. Ensured that every reference entry is formatted as “[number] TITLE, URL” with exactly two newline characters separating each entry.
2. Verified that each title exactly matches the original JSON record (no alterations were made) and that the URLs are complete.
3. Reviewed all sections to confirm the consistent structure with each reference list appearing immediately below its corresponding summary section.

This file now fully meets all Step 7 requirements.

====================

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!
