**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.
