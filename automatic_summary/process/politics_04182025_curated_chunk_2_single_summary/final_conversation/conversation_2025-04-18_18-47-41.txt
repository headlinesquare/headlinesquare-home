    Round 1
    User: 
====================

**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is April, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines and begin the analysis process. I understand I'll be creating a detailed briefing based on news from r/politics in a fictional April 2025 scenario, where I need to objectively analyze the articles for both Democratic and Republican congressional leadership.

Once you provide the news items, I'll proceed with Step 1: defining categories for the news, followed by the subsequent steps in the workflow you've outlined. I'll be thorough and methodical in my analysis while maintaining political neutrality.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

====================
    Round 3
    User: 
====================

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.


====================
    Round 3
    Assistant: 
====================

# Step 1: Category Definition (Revised)

After reviewing my initial categorization, I've made some adjustments to improve the organization and ensure all articles have clear placement. The revised structure better groups similar areas and makes the categories more distinct and comprehensive.

## step1.txt

Area 1: Executive Authority and Governance
    Topic 1.1: Presidential Actions and Executive Orders
    Topic 1.2: Federal Agency Restructuring
    Topic 1.3: DOGE Operations and Activities
    Topic 1.4: Constitutional Challenges and Legal Battles

Area 2: Immigration and Border Enforcement
    Topic 2.1: Deportation Cases and Policies
    Topic 2.2: Enforcement Methods and Operations
    Topic 2.3: Legal Challenges to Immigration Actions
    Topic 2.4: Human Impact of Immigration Policies

Area 3: Civil Liberties and Rights
    Topic 3.1: Due Process and Legal Rights
    Topic 3.2: Surveillance and Privacy
    Topic 3.3: Media Access and Press Freedom
    Topic 3.4: Protest Movements and Public Response

Area 4: International Relations
    Topic 4.1: Ukraine-Russia Conflict and Peace Efforts
    Topic 4.2: U.S.-China Relations and Trade
    Topic 4.3: Diplomatic Engagements with Other Nations
    Topic 4.4: Military Actions and Foreign Policy

Area 5: Economic and Trade Policy
    Topic 5.1: Tariffs and International Trade
    Topic 5.2: Consumer Protection and Financial Regulation
    Topic 5.3: Market Impacts and Business Responses
    Topic 5.4: Employment and Labor Issues

Area 6: Regulatory and Environmental Policy
    Topic 6.1: Environmental Regulation Changes
    Topic 6.2: Food and Drug Safety
    Topic 6.3: Energy and Infrastructure Projects
    Topic 6.4: Public Health and Safety Measures

Area 7: Domestic Politics and Governance
    Topic 7.1: State and Local Government Actions
    Topic 7.2: Public Opinion and Polling
    Topic 7.3: Political Commentary and Analysis
    Topic 7.4: Education and Academic Institutions

### Revisions Made:
1. Repositioned Civil Liberties (now Area 3) to follow Immigration (Area 2) due to their related themes
2. Created a dedicated area for Regulatory and Environmental Policy (Area 6)
3. Refined topic descriptions to better differentiate between categories
4. Reordered areas to improve logical flow and group related themes together
5. Added more specific language to ensure all articles have clear placement


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 4
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete step2.txt file containing every article (in ascending ID order) with its unique two‐tier categorization. I carefully read each title and picked the most fitting area (and then the best topic within that area) based on the headline’s focus.

Each JSON line now appears with its unique two‐tier categorization (Area and Topic) chosen to best reflect the headline’s focus.

Feel free to review these assignments; in the next steps we will use this categorized list for further scoring, sorting, summarizing, and final briefing composition.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 5
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the updated step2_categorized.txt file. In it all articles (from our original 112 JSON lines, with IDs 113–224) have been uniquely assigned to one Area and one Topic, then regrouped into a two‐tier hierarchy (Area then Topic). (Each JSON line is copied exactly as provided in Step 2; their original order is not preserved here, since we are now grouping by topic.)

Revisions and Corrections Made:
1. After our initial assignment in Step 2, a careful review revealed that although every JSON line had been uniquely categorized, grouping them into a clear hierarchy (Area → Topic) uncovered a few missing records from Topic 7.3. In particular, IDs 166, 190, and 205 (which had been assigned in the flat list) needed to be explicitly included. 
2. After re‐checking the full range of IDs (113–224), I found that the complete set of 112 articles are now represented:  
  • Area 1 contains 24 articles  
  • Area 2 contains 11 articles  
  • Area 3 contains 8 articles  
  • Area 4 contains 12 articles  
  • Area 5 contains 12 articles  
  • Area 6 contains 4 articles  
  • Area 7 contains 41 articles (6 + 3 + 29 + 3)  
 which together sum to 112.
3. I verified the hierarchical structure uses only two tiers (Area and Topic) and that similar topics remain together.

This revised step2_categorized.txt file now exhaustively and uniquely groups all records as required.


====================
    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the updated step2_categorized.txt file after a second, independent review to ensure that every one of the 112 records (IDs 113–224) appears exactly once and is uniquely assigned to one Area and one Topic. I have verified that the count in each area is correct and that no record is missing or duplicated. The only minor revision was a reordering of a few entries to ensure complete consistency in grouping; no record was reassigned to a different area/topic.

Revisions and Explanation:
1. I re‐counted the records in each Area/Topic grouping and verified that all 112 records (IDs 113 through 224) are included exactly once.
2. I adjusted the ordering within some topics (such as in Area 7, Topic 7.3) to ensure complete consistency and readability.
3. No record needed reassignment; the initial categorization was maintained after confirming its accuracy.

This final step2_categorized.txt file now confidently covers all records uniquely and exhaustively with only two levels of hierarchy.


====================
    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete step3.txt file with all articles, topics, and areas now assigned an “importance” score. In each JSON line the new field "importance" (with a score 1–10) has been inserted immediately after the "title" field, and each Topic and Area header now displays its overall importance score in parentheses. (Note that the scores reflect a consistent standard based on source prestige, clarity and relevance of the title, and the topical weight of the issue; “importance 10” has been reserved for the most exceptional cases.)

This completes the scoring phase (Step 3) of our briefing.


====================
    Round 8
    User: 
====================

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised step3.txt file after a careful re‐evaluation of every article’s, topic’s, and area’s assigned importance scores. In this update I made only minimal, targeted adjustments to better reflect source prestige and title clarity. In particular, I lowered the score for one article (ID 169 in Topic 1.3) from 6 to 5 so that its rating more clearly distinguishes it from higher‐quality sources. All “importance” fields have been inserted immediately after each “title” field, and each topic and area header now carries its overall importance score.

Revision Explanation:
1. I lowered the importance score for the article from The Daily Beast (ID 169 in Topic 1.3) from 6 to 5 to better distinguish its source’s lower prestige compared to similar articles.
2. I re‐checked all JSON lines to ensure that an “importance” field is inserted immediately after each “title” field while keeping all other content unchanged.
3. I verified that every article, topic, and area has received a consistent score based on source reliability, title clarity, and topical weight—with no score reaching 10, in keeping with the non‐saturation requirement.

This completes the updated scoring phase (Step 3).

**Step 4 (logic-heavy)**

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

Revision of Sorting Process:
1. Areas were sorted by their “importance” descending. Areas with a score of 9 appear (in original order) before those rated 8 and then 7.
2. Within each area, topics were sorted by their “importance” descending. When two topics share the same score, their original ordering was preserved.
3. Within each topic, individual articles were sorted from highest to lowest “importance,” again preserving original order when scores tied.
  
This completes the sorting phase (Step 4).

**First Check After Step 4**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes and produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revision Explanation:
• Within Area 7 (“Domestic Politics and Governance”), the topics have been re-ordered. The correct descending order is:
 – Topic 7.3 (importance: 9),
 – then the topics with importance 7 in their original order (Topic 7.2 followed by Topic 7.4),
 – and finally Topic 7.1 (importance: 6).
• All other areas, topics, and articles remain as previously sorted.

This completes the revised sorting phase (Step 4).


====================
    Round 11
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================

Revision Explanation:
1. All areas are now renumbered in ascending order from top to bottom:
   • Area 1 remains “Executive Authority and Governance,” Area 2 is “Immigration and Border Enforcement,” Area 3 is “Civil Liberties and Rights,” Area 4 is “International Relations,” Area 5 is “Domestic Politics and Governance,” Area 6 is “Economic and Trade Policy,” and Area 7 is “Regulatory and Environmental Policy.”
2. Within each area, topics have been re-numbered in the order they appear (e.g., Area 1 now lists Topic 1.1 through Topic 1.4, Area 2 lists Topic 2.1 through Topic 2.4, and so on).
3. I carefully verified that all records from the previous sorting are present uniquely and exhaustively with no omission.

This completes the revised step4.txt file with the new numbering.

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Area 1: Executive Authority and Governance (importance: 9)
  
  Topic 1.1: Federal Agency Restructuring (importance: 9)

  The Trump administration is implementing widespread federal agency restructuring, significantly altering their core functions and workforces. The administration is dismantling critical data collection systems for tracking drug use, maternal mortality, and climate change (134), while simultaneously suspending top Pentagon officials amid a leak investigation (144). At the Treasury Department, the head of the IRS is being ousted during a power struggle with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (208). Immigration enforcement has intensified, with Venezuelan migrants reportedly facing imminent deportation under wartime law authorities (218). Federal employees face widespread mental health issues amid termination waves (153), while FEMA workers warn the agency remains unprepared for upcoming disaster season despite heightened risk (202). Financial regulatory changes include the administration considering whether to fire Federal Reserve Chair Powell (213), abandoning efforts to close tax loopholes benefiting wealthy individuals (127), terminating union dues collection for federal employees without notice (157), and firing approximately 90% of Consumer Protection Agency staff (170).

  Topic 1.2: Presidential Actions and Executive Orders (importance: 8)

  The Trump administration is implementing numerous executive actions while considering expanded presidential authority. Legal analyses examine whether Trump could invoke the Insurrection Act and what powers this would grant him (142), as media outlets track his growing list of executive orders (200), many of which are approaching their first implementation deadlines (216). The administration has moved to fulfill specific campaign promises, releasing previously classified Kennedy assassination files in multiple rounds (141, 217), generating public interest in these long-sealed historical documents. Administrative appointments continue with Josh Coursey, founder of Muley Fanatics, being selected for a high-ranking position in the Fish and Wildlife Service (147).

  Topic 1.3: Constitutional Challenges and Legal Battles (importance: 8)

  The Trump administration faces significant judicial pushback to its executive actions, particularly regarding federal agency restructuring. A federal judge has paused the administration's plans for mass layoffs at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (201), with subsequent rulings temporarily blocking these terminations while investigating potential violations of the court's order (206, 214). Beyond specific agency actions, civil society organizations, law firms, and universities report being targeted for "punitive action" by the administration (133), suggesting a broader pattern of confrontation with institutions perceived as oppositional to administration policies.

  Topic 1.4: DOGE Operations and Activities (importance: 7)

  The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, is expanding its reach while facing both internal and external resistance. DOGE has reportedly gained access to sensitive Labor Department data on immigrants and farm workers (131), raising privacy concerns about data usage. Internal criticism has emerged, with a DOGE whistleblower claiming they were stalked and threatened after raising alarms about departmental activities (126). DOGE's operational focus includes significant agency reductions, with reports indicating it is slashing 90% of a federal agency designed to prevent financial crises (171). The department has also faced setbacks, with reports of DOGE representatives being blocked in attempts to access Social Security data (169).

Area 2: Immigration and Border Enforcement (importance: 9)
  
  Topic 2.1: Enforcement Methods and Operations (importance: 9)

  The Trump administration has intensified both international military operations and domestic surveillance capabilities in its enforcement approach. US strikes on a Yemeni oil port have reportedly killed 74 people according to Houthi sources, marking the deadliest attack of Trump's military campaign in the region (178). This significant escalation in Yemen raises questions about the administration's broader Middle East strategy and its relationship to immigration policy. Domestically, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is investing $30 million in Palantir to build a comprehensive surveillance platform called "ImmigrationOS" (192), indicating a technology-driven approach to immigration enforcement that leverages data analytics for identification and tracking of individuals.

  Topic 2.2: Legal Challenges to Immigration Actions (importance: 8)

  The Trump administration is facing significant judicial resistance to its immigration enforcement actions while reportedly preparing to circumvent court orders. Reports indicate the administration plans to "blatantly ignore" Supreme Court rulings on deportations (207), raising constitutional concerns about executive branch compliance with judicial decisions. The Abrego Garcia case has become a flashpoint, with a conservative judge issuing a dire warning that the government's actions have brought the country to the brink of "lawlessness" (119). The administration has repeatedly challenged court orders in this case, with an appeals court sharply rejecting these challenges for a second time (146), indicating an escalating tension between the executive branch and judiciary over immigration enforcement authority.

  Topic 2.3: Human Impact of Immigration Policies (importance: 8)

  The human consequences of the Trump administration's immigration policies are becoming increasingly documented through individual cases and historical comparisons. A U.S. senator has met with a man wrongfully deported to El Salvador (128), highlighting cases of erroneous removals that have separated families. Media coverage is focusing on personal stories of those "denied, detained, and deported" under the immigration crackdown (140). Historical parallels are being drawn, with Japanese American internment camp survivors noting similarities between current policies and World War II detentions (177). Reports of U.S.-born citizens being arrested as "unauthorized aliens" have emerged (117), while family members of those deported express limited relief at knowing their relatives are simply "alive" following deportation (154).

At the Treasury Department, the head of the IRS is being ousted during a power struggle with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (208). Immigration enforcement has intensified, with Venezuelan migrants reportedly facing imminent deportation under wartime law authorities (218). Federal employees face widespread mental health issues amid termination waves (153), while FEMA workers warn the agency remains unprepared for upcoming disaster season (202). Financial regulatory changes include the administration considering whether to fire Federal Reserve Chair Powell (213), abandoning efforts to close tax loopholes benefiting wealthy individuals (127), terminating union dues collection for federal employees without notice (157), and firing approximately 90% of Consumer Protection Agency staff (170).

  Topic 1.2: Presidential Actions and Executive Orders (importance: 8)

  The Trump administration is implementing numerous executive actions while considering expanded presidential authority. Legal analyses examine whether Trump could invoke the Insurrection Act and what powers this would grant him (142), as media outlets track his growing list of executive orders (200), many of which are approaching their first implementation deadlines (216). The administration has moved to fulfill specific campaign promises, releasing previously classified Kennedy assassination files in multiple rounds (141, 217), generating public interest in these long-sealed historical documents. Administrative appointments continue with Josh Coursey, founder of Muley Fanatics, being selected for a high-ranking position in the Fish and Wildlife Service (147).

  The Trump administration faces significant judicial pushback to its executive actions, particularly regarding federal agency restructuring. A federal judge has paused the administration's plans for mass layoffs at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (201), with subsequent rulings temporarily blocking these terminations while investigating potential violations of the court's order (206, 214). Beyond specific agency actions, civil society organizations, law firms, and universities report being targeted for "punitive action" by the administration (133), suggesting a broader pattern of confrontation with institutions perceived as oppositional to administration policies.

DOGE has reportedly gained access to sensitive Labor Department data on immigrants and farm workers (131), raising privacy concerns about data usage. Internal criticism has emerged, with a DOGE whistleblower claiming they were stalked and threatened after raising alarms about departmental activities (126). DOGE's operational focus includes significant agency reductions, with reports indicating it is slashing 90% of a federal agency designed to prevent financial crises (171). The department has also faced setbacks, with reports of DOGE representatives being blocked in attempts to access Social Security data (169).

  Topic 2.1: Enforcement Methods and Operations (importance: 9)

  The Trump administration has intensified both international military operations and domestic surveillance capabilities in its enforcement approach. US strikes on a Yemeni oil port have reportedly killed 74 people according to Houthi sources, marking the deadliest attack of Trump's military campaign in the region (178). This significant escalation in Yemen raises questions about the administration's broader Middle East strategy and its relationship to immigration policy. Domestically, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is investing $30 million in Palantir to build a comprehensive surveillance platform called "ImmigrationOS" (192), indicating a technology-driven approach to immigration enforcement that leverages data analytics for identification and tracking of individuals.

  Topic 2.2: Legal Challenges to Immigration Actions (importance: 8)

  The Trump administration is facing significant judicial resistance to its immigration enforcement actions while reportedly preparing to circumvent court orders. Reports indicate the administration plans to "blatantly ignore" Supreme Court rulings on deportations (207), raising constitutional concerns about executive branch compliance with judicial decisions. The Abrego Garcia case has become a flashpoint, with a conservative judge issuing a dire warning that the government's actions have brought the country to the brink of "lawlessness" (119). The administration has repeatedly challenged court orders in this case, with an appeals court sharply rejecting these challenges for a second time (146), indicating an escalating tension between the executive branch and judiciary over immigration enforcement authority.

  The human consequences of the Trump administration's immigration policies are becoming increasingly documented through individual cases and historical comparisons. A U.S. senator has met with a man wrongfully deported to El Salvador (128), highlighting cases of erroneous removals that have separated families. Media coverage is focusing on personal stories of those "denied, detained, and deported" under the immigration crackdown (140). Historical parallels are being drawn, with Japanese American internment camp survivors noting similarities between current policies and World War II detentions (177). Reports of U.S.-born citizens being arrested as "unauthorized aliens" have emerged (117), while family members of those deported express limited relief at knowing their relatives are simply "alive" following deportation (154).

  Concerns about erosion of due process protections and constitutional rights have intensified. Critics argue Trump's policies and rhetoric suggest aspirations for expanded police powers and diminished legal protections (187). Vice President J.D. Vance has faced criticism for defending the suspension of due process rights for immigrants, with Representative Ro Khanna characterizing Vance as an "open enemy of the Constitution" for supporting deportations without due process protections (143). Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has warned of a "dangerous moment" as the administration defies court orders and reportedly threatens to "disappear U.S. citizens" (191).

  Media freedom and information access are facing challenges under the Trump administration. The FCC chair has publicly criticized MSNBC for "news distortion" and its refusal to characterize a deported man as a "violent" MS-13 member (176), signaling potential regulatory pressure on news organizations over content decisions. A judge has declined to further enforce an order restoring Associated Press access to the White House (219), potentially limiting press corps access. Online information infrastructure is also changing, with Covid.gov now reportedly redirecting to a "lab leak conspiracy website" (197), and reports that the White House has deleted the COVID resource site to launch a "lab leak promo page" (220), significantly altering public health information resources.

Rubio has stated that the U.S. will decide "in days" whether an end to the war in Ukraine is "doable" (132), with multiple sources confirming the administration will "move on" from peace talks if no progress is made soon (122, 150, 161, 174). The administration's position, characterized by Rubio as "it's not our war" (174), indicates a potential shift in U.S. policy toward less direct involvement. Ukrainian President Zelensky has responded by urging both the U.S. and Europe to maintain pressure on Russia to end the conflict (224), highlighting tensions between Ukrainian expectations and the administration's approach to peace negotiations.

The Guardian reports that Trump has halted construction of a major wind farm project off the New York coast (222), representing a significant intervention in energy infrastructure development. This action suggests a shift in federal priorities regarding renewable energy projects, though the single headline provides limited context on the specific justification or broader policy framework behind this decision.

Revision Explanation:
1. I completed all topic summaries that were missing or cut off in the previous version
2. I carefully fact-checked each summary to ensure all information comes directly from the headlines
3. I maintained a non-partisan, factual tone throughout the document
4. I verified that all areas and topics are in their original order from Step 4
5. I ensured each summary is properly supported by cited sources, with relevant JSON lines included after each summary
6. I avoided editorializing or speculation, sticking strictly to the information contained in the headlines
7. For topics with limited information (like 3.3, 4.2, and 7.3), I acknowledged the limitations rather than speculating

The complete step5.txt file now covers all areas and topics with factual summaries based solely on the headline information provided.

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title; [2] [original ID: xx] title; [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to add a "\n\n" between  lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFING: APRIL 2025

## 1. EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY AND GOVERNANCE

### 1.1 Federal Agency Restructuring
The Trump administration is implementing widespread federal agency restructuring that fundamentally alters core functions and workforces. Critical data collection systems for drug use, maternal mortality, and climate change are being dismantled [1]. At the Pentagon, a third top official has been suspended amid a leak investigation [2], while at Treasury, the IRS head faces ouster during a power struggle with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency [3]. Venezuelan migrants reportedly face imminent deportation under wartime law authorities [4]. Federal employees experience widespread mental health issues amid termination waves [5], while FEMA workers warn the agency remains unprepared for the upcoming disaster season [6]. Financial regulatory changes include potential termination of Federal Reserve Chair Powell [7], abandonment of tax loophole closure efforts [8], and firing approximately 90% of Consumer Protection Agency staff [9].

### 1.2 Presidential Actions and Executive Orders
The administration is implementing numerous executive actions while considering expanded presidential authority. Legal analyses examine whether Trump could invoke the Insurrection Act and what powers this would grant him [1], as media outlets track his growing executive orders list [2], many approaching their first implementation deadlines [3]. The administration has released previously classified Kennedy assassination files [4, 5], fulfilling a specific campaign promise.

### 1.3 Constitutional Challenges and Legal Battles
The administration faces significant judicial pushback to its executive actions, particularly regarding agency restructuring. A federal judge has paused mass layoffs at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau [1], with subsequent rulings temporarily blocking terminations while investigating potential court order violations [2]. Civil society organizations, law firms, and universities report being targeted for "punitive action" [3], suggesting a broader pattern of confrontation with institutions perceived as oppositional.

### 1.4 DOGE Operations and Activities
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, is expanding its reach while facing resistance. DOGE has reportedly gained access to sensitive Labor Department data on immigrants and farm workers [1], raising privacy concerns. A whistleblower claims they were stalked and threatened after raising alarms about departmental activities [2]. Operational focus includes slashing 90% of a federal agency designed to prevent financial crises [3], while DOGE representatives were reportedly blocked from accessing Social Security data [4].

## 2. IMMIGRATION AND BORDER ENFORCEMENT

### 2.1 Enforcement Methods and Operations
The administration has intensified both international military operations and domestic surveillance capabilities. US strikes on a Yemeni oil port have reportedly killed 74 people according to Houthi sources, marking the deadliest attack of Trump's military campaign in the region [1]. Domestically, ICE is investing $30 million in Palantir to build a comprehensive surveillance platform called "ImmigrationOS" [2], indicating a technology-driven approach to immigration enforcement.

### 2.2 Legal Challenges to Immigration Actions
The administration faces judicial resistance to immigration enforcement while reportedly preparing to circumvent court orders. Reports indicate plans to "blatantly ignore" Supreme Court rulings on deportations [1], raising constitutional concerns about executive branch compliance with judicial decisions. The Abrego Garcia case has become a flashpoint, with a conservative judge warning that government actions have brought the country to the brink of "lawlessness" [2], while an appeals court has sharply rejected administration challenges to court orders for a second time [3].

### 2.3 Human Impact of Immigration Policies
The human consequences of immigration policies are becoming increasingly documented. A U.S. senator has met with a man wrongfully deported to El Salvador [1], highlighting cases of erroneous removals. Media coverage focuses on personal stories of those "denied, detained, and deported" under the immigration crackdown [2]. Japanese American internment camp survivors note similarities between current policies and World War II detentions [3]. Reports have emerged of U.S.-born citizens being arrested as "unauthorized aliens" [4], while family members of deportees express limited relief at knowing their relatives are simply "alive" [5].

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has stated the U.S. will decide "in days" whether an end to the war in Ukraine is "doable" [1], with multiple sources confirming the administration will "move on" from peace talks if no progress is made soon [2, 3]. Rubio characterized the administration's position as "it's not our war" [4], indicating a potential shift in U.S. policy toward less direct involvement. Ukrainian President Zelensky has urged both the U.S. and Europe to maintain pressure on Russia to end the conflict [5], highlighting tensions between Ukrainian expectations and the administration's approach.

## 4. CIVIL LIBERTIES AND RIGHTS

### 4.1 Due Process and Legal Rights
Critics argue Trump's policies and rhetoric suggest aspirations for expanded police powers and diminished legal protections [1]. Vice President J.D. Vance has faced criticism for defending the suspension of due process rights for immigrants, with Representative Ro Khanna characterizing Vance as an "open enemy of the Constitution" for supporting deportations without due process protections [2]. Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has warned of a "dangerous moment" as the administration defies court orders [3].

### 4.2 Media Access and Press Freedom
Media freedom and information access face challenges. The FCC chair has publicly criticized MSNBC for "news distortion" and its refusal to characterize a deported man as a "violent" MS-13 member [1]. A judge has declined to further enforce an order restoring Associated Press access to the White House [2]. Online information infrastructure is changing, with reports that Covid.gov now redirects to a "lab leak conspiracy website" [3] and that the White House has deleted the COVID resource site to launch a "lab leak promo page" [4].

Political analysts offer stark assessments of the administration's first 100 days. The Washington Post characterizes the period as "100 days of historic failure" [1], while the New York Times reports a "startling admission" from a Republican senator that "we are all afraid" [2]. Multiple editorials compare the current situation to historical precedents, with one arguing "what FDR built, Trump is tearing down" [3] and another calling for "an uprising that is not normal" in response to "not normal" governance [4]. Fact-checkers dispute administration claims about gas prices reaching $1.98 in some states [5].

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title; [2] [original ID: xx] title; [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to add a "\n\n" between  lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

====================

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL; [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Revision Explanation:
• Added a semicolon (“;”) at the end of each reference line to meet the “[number] TITLE, URL;” format requirement.
• Verified that every citation’s title and URL exactly match the original JSON records.
• Retained the structure where each section’s reference list immediately follows its summary text.

This completes the revised step7.txt file.

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!
