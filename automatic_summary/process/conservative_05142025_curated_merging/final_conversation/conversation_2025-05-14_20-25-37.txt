    Round 1
    User: 
====================

**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

---

Because there are several hundreds of news articles posted in some subreddit communities every day, it is hard to summarize all of them in a single process. Fortunately, I have already broken the articles in that day into chunks by submission time in the 24 hour coverage window in ascending order, and generated summaries for each chunk with LLMs. Those detailed summary chunks will be posted here. Each has a length of 1300-1700 words without counting the URLs, and citing 30-50 news articles. 

The chunks are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, there are 4 chunks, and the news coverage cycle is from yesterday's 18:00 to today's 18:00. Chunk 1 is from the articles submitted between 18:00 of yesterday to 06:00 of today, Chunk 2 is for 06:00 to 10:00 today, Chunk 3 is for 10:00 to 14:00 today, and Chunk 4 is from 14:00 to 18:00 today. The first chunk is based on the earliest articles submitted to the subreddit community. The last chunk is based on the latest articles submitted. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in Chunk 2 **happen** after all the news stories in Chunk 1, just because they are **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from Chunk 1 and B from Chunk 2, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This rule applies to all chunks in sequential order. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from different chunks. 

**Your task is to critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks, and then faithfully merge all of them into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks.** 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

---

Please tell me if you are ready to receive the individual summaries. I will provide them all at once. And please follow my later instructions, be patient, do the work step by step.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the individual summary chunks. Please provide them all at once, and I'll carefully analyze them to create a comprehensive Daily Briefing that synthesizes the information in an objective manner suitable for both Democratic and Republican leadership. I understand this requires handling substantial content with patience and thoroughness.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1**

Comparing:

Please critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks provided below. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You must use your limited length to summarize the most important news, while skipping the secondary.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.

Please carefully think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. **You will do the merging task in the next round with my detailed instructions. Please do not attempt to write down your summary at this step, because you haven't been given the full instructions yet!** It is always better to take some time to think clearly for such a difficult task, and make detailed plans for yourself, before taking any actions. You should use this opportunity to prepare yourself for your next round of work by writing down some notes for yourself.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Foreign Policy and Diplomacy

### 1.1 Middle East Peace Initiatives
President Trump is actively expanding the Abraham Accords. During his Saudi Arabia visit, Trump announced plans to negotiate an Iran deal and add more nations to the Abraham Accords [1]. Trump has also asked Syria to join the accords and normalize ties with Israel, offering sanctions relief in return [2]. These diplomatic overtures represent significant movement in reshaping Middle East alliances.

### 1.2 Russia-Ukraine Conflict
Senator Marco Rubio has been appointed to lead Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations. Trump confirmed Rubio will travel to Turkey to oversee these talks [1]. No further details about the peace talks' agenda have emerged, but this appointment signals direct U.S. intervention in the conflict resolution process.

### 1.3 International Trade and Sanctions
The administration has enacted several major trade policy shifts. The U.S. has cut defense ties with Cuba over "non-cooperation" after Cuba harbored terror fugitives [1]. The White House has reduced "de minimis" tariffs on China to 54% [2], while China has criticized a new U.S.-UK trade deal as violating the "basic principle" not to target other countries [3]. Trump has also proposed tariffs to boost American film industry jobs, though public opinion remains divided on whether this approach will succeed [4].

### 1.4 Qatar Relations and Aircraft Gift
Qatar's growing influence in U.S. politics has raised concerns amid controversy over its aircraft gift to Trump. Reports detail how Qatar has spent nearly $100 billion establishing influence across American institutions including Congress, universities, newsrooms, think tanks, and corporations [1]. President Trump recently visited Qatar as the jet offer brought increased scrutiny to Qatar's Washington influence [2]. Trump has defended accepting Qatar's $400 million aircraft gift, stating "We should have the most impressive plane" [3] and later clarifying ownership details [4]. Some commentators have dismissed concerns about the gift as "much ado about nothing" and a "nonstory" [5].

## 2. Immigration and Border Security

### 2.1 Immigration Enforcement Actions
Federal courts have backed President Trump's deportation authority. A judge upheld Trump's power to deport criminal migrants under the Alien Enemies Act [1], while another judge specifically approved Venezuelan deportations under the same act [2]. DHS chief Noem has escalated tensions by accusing lawmakers of "committing felonies" at a Newark ICE facility and stating "they should be censured" [3]. Reports indicate Trump possesses a "secret weapon" against activist judges on immigration matters [4], though specific details aren't provided.

### 2.2 Criminal Activity by Migrants
The murder of a South Carolina mother allegedly by six illegal migrants has intensified immigration debates. The local sheriff condemned the act as defying "decency" in "civilized society" [1].

### 2.3 State and Local Immigration Responses
Local resistance to federal immigration policies continues across multiple fronts. Newark's mayor, recently arrested at an ICE protest, compared the situation to a biblical narrative, calling it "our David moment" [1]. Tennessee's Democratic state legislators and Nashville officials are reportedly "testing the boundaries of immigration laws" [2]. Meanwhile, the Episcopal Church has refused to resettle White South African refugees, creating direct conflict with the Trump administration [3].

## 3. Governance and Congressional Relations

### 3.1 Legislative Developments
House Republicans have advanced Trump's agenda through marathon sessions. GOP representatives moved Trump's priorities forward after an "all-night committee debate" [1], indicating both urgency and potential controversy surrounding the administration's legislative agenda.

References:  
[1] House GOP moves Trump's agenda forward after all-night committee debate, https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-gop-moves-trumps-agenda-forward-all-night-committee-debate  

### 3.2 Executive Branch Activities
The administration is reviewing its predecessor's final actions. Trump's new pardon attorney will scrutinize Biden's "11th-hour pardons" issued during the final days of the previous administration [1]. Media commentary has framed Trump's leadership positively, with one commentator noting Americans are seeing "a dealmaker, peacemaker, realist and optimist at work" [2].

## 4. Economic and Fiscal Policy

### 4.1 Inflation and Monetary Policy
Inflation has decreased unexpectedly, triggering calls for rate cuts. U.S. inflation slowed to 2.3% in April, below forecasts, prompting President Trump to press the Federal Reserve to "slash rates," stating "Just let it all happen" [1].

### 4.2 Welfare and Budget Initiatives
The administration is pushing welfare reform centered on work requirements. A "food stamp plank" in the budget bill would "curb state dodges" of existing requirements [1], aligning with the Trump team's position that "If You Want Welfare and Can Work, You Must" [2]. However, internal Republican divisions have emerged, as "some congressional Republicans oppose defunding Planned Parenthood" in what Trump has labeled his "big, beautiful" bill [3]. Federal revenue collection has exceeded expectations, with "IRS Revenue Surges 9% Despite Predictions of Decline" [4]. In regulatory matters, EPA Administrator Zeldin has vowed to "take action against controversial start-stop vehicle system" [5], though specific concerns about this automotive technology remain unclear.

## 5. Legal System and Judicial Affairs

### 5.1 High-Profile Legal Cases
Several consequential legal matters are advancing through courts nationwide. Minneapolis and state leaders are reportedly preparing for a potential Derek Chauvin pardon [1], while a federal judge has seized control of Rikers Island detention facility from New York City authorities [2]. UCLA Medical School faces litigation claiming continued use of race in admissions [3], creating a test case for affirmative action policies. The Menendez brothers, whose murder case gained national attention decades ago, now face a "moderate risk" label in their bid for resentencing [4].

### 5.2 Judicial and Law Enforcement Developments
Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan has been indicted for allegedly helping an illegal migrant evade Immigration and Customs Enforcement [1], representing a rare case of judicial prosecution related to immigration matters. In drug enforcement, Sinaloa cartel leaders face narco-terrorism charges after authorities seized 1.65 tons of fentanyl [2]. Security experts warn of technological exploitation by a "violent Venezuelan gang" to "turbocharge its dominance" [3], highlighting emerging transnational criminal threats.

## 6. Political Opposition and Partisan Dynamics

### 6.1 Democratic Party Resistance
Democratic leaders are blocking Trump's nominees and threatening escalation. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has moved to block Trump's Department of Justice nominees, specifically citing the Qatari jet gift as justification [1]. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has warned that the Trump administration will have a "problem" if more Democrats are arrested [2], indicating potential for intensified partisan conflict.

### 6.2 Protests and Campus Activity
Public demonstrations continue to disrupt legislative and academic settings. Capitol Police arrested protesters who disrupted a budget markup session, with Senator Cory Booker publicly thanking them for "defending Medicaid" [1]. At Columbia University, the "mood" has reportedly changed following the "quashing of latest protest," with "Trump pressure" apparently influencing campus developments [2].

### 6.3 Biden Administration Legacy and Media Commentary
New information about the previous administration continues to emerge. Biden's former energy loan official, who directed "billions" to green companies, is now reportedly working "to move them overseas" [1]. Headlines reveal Biden aides had "discussed whether president would need wheelchair if re-elected" [2], and actor George Clooney was reportedly "shaken" when Biden failed to recognize him at a fundraiser [3]. Media figures are offering divergent narratives on current politics. Mark Halperin claims "Fetterman's behavior behind the scenes warrants major concerns" [4]. One outlet accuses media organizations of launching a "reputation rescue op after covering up Biden's decline" [5], while another headline states "Donald Trump Just Made It Harder To Go To Federal Prison" [6] without providing specifics.

DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Trump Administration & Executive Policy

### 1.1 Presidential Powers & Constitutional Questions
President Trump's implementation of a birthright citizenship ban has created a direct challenge that could force the Supreme Court to reconsider its approach to nationwide injunctions [1]. Analysis suggests this move may be a calculated legal strategy extending beyond citizenship policy, potentially seeking to reshape judicial review powers [2]. The administration's recent unspecified actions have generated significant international reaction [3].

### 1.2 Department Funding & Regulatory Reform
The DOJ has redirected funding previously allocated to projects and DEI initiatives toward law enforcement support [1]. President Trump has criticized the federal regulatory framework, which reportedly encompasses 175,000 pages, describing the proliferation of regulatory crimes as having "absurd and unjust" consequences [2]. An executive order has established a program to house 6,000 veterans by 2028, funded by redirecting resources from services for illegal immigrants [3].

## 2. International Relations

### 2.1 Qatar Partnerships
The Trump administration has formalized significant agreements with Qatar on defense cooperation and Boeing purchases [1], including a formal visit to the Qatar Royal Court [2]. These diplomatic efforts have culminated in a White House announcement of a $1.2 trillion economic commitment with Qatar, which includes a Boeing aircraft order described as "significant" [3].

### 2.2 China Relations & Security Concerns
U.S. officials have discovered unauthorized "rogue" communication devices embedded in Chinese-manufactured power inverters [1]. Similar findings of hidden communications equipment in Chinese solar power components have raised additional security concerns [2]. These discoveries occur against the backdrop of ongoing analysis of U.S.-China economic relationships, including examination of how Apple's offshoring contributed to China's economic rise [3].

### 2.3 Middle East Policy
President Trump has met with Syria's interim president [1], marking a significant shift in U.S. diplomatic engagement. This meeting appears to be part of a broader Middle East strategy [2]. Reports indicate Syrian citizens are publicly celebrating the establishment of diplomatic relations with the United States [3].

## 3. Economic Policy & Healthcare

### 3.1 Drug Pricing & Healthcare Economics
Pharmaceutical company Roche has warned that President Trump's executive order on drug pricing could jeopardize its planned $50 billion investment in the United States [1]. The policy has created uncertainty in the pharmaceutical sector [2]. At the state level, California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed changes to the state's Medi-Cal program for undocumented adults [3], with reports suggesting he wants to end free healthcare for illegal immigrants [4].

### 3.2 Corporate Governance & Government Spending
Critics have targeted the Business Roundtable for allegedly prioritizing ideology over merit in corporate America [1]. A separate analysis characterizes Pentagon spending as "massive" and occurring "by design" [2].

# Critical Analysis of Summary Chunks

After reviewing the two summary chunks, I've identified key similarities, differences, and important themes that should be addressed in a merged summary.

## Similarities Between Chunks
- Both cover foreign policy initiatives, particularly Middle East peace efforts and Qatar relations
- Immigration and border security feature prominently in both summaries
- Economic policies and fiscal matters appear in both chunks
- Both address opposition from Democratic lawmakers and partisan tensions
- Legal and judicial developments are covered in both summaries

## Differences Between Chunks
- Chunk 1 contains more details on Russia-Ukraine negotiations and welfare reform initiatives
- Chunk 2 provides more coverage of constitutional challenges, technology issues, and healthcare policy
- Chunk 2 includes newer developments related to policies mentioned in Chunk 1
- Coverage of Democratic opposition differs between chunks, with Chunk 2 focusing more on impeachment efforts
- Chunk 2 introduces topics not in Chunk 1, such as AI impact and educational controversies

## Merged Hierarchical Categories Plan

I propose organizing the merged summary with the following hierarchical structure:

1. **Executive Authority and White House Initiatives**
   - Presidential powers and constitutional challenges
   - Executive orders and agency directives
   - Departmental reorganization and appointments

2. **Foreign Policy and International Relations**
   - Middle East peace initiatives (Abraham Accords, Syria)
   - Russia-Ukraine negotiations
   - Qatar agreements and aircraft gift controversy
   - International trade policies and sanctions
   - China relations and security concerns

3. **Immigration and Border Security**
   - Immigration enforcement and deportation policies
   - Legal challenges to immigration policies
   - State and local resistance
   - Border-related incidents

4. **Economic and Fiscal Policy**
   - Budget initiatives and welfare reform
   - Inflation and monetary policy
   - Regulatory changes
   - Corporate governance issues

5. **Legal System and Judicial Affairs**
   - High-profile cases and judicial developments
   - Law enforcement actions
   - Constitutional challenges

6. **Political Opposition and Partisan Dynamics**
   - Democratic Party resistance strategies
   - Congressional relations
   - Protests and demonstrations
   - Impeachment efforts
   - Biden administration legacy

7. **Technology and Social Issues** (if space permits)
   - AI developments
   - Healthcare policy changes
   - Education controversies

This structure will allow me to effectively synthesize the information from both chunks while maintaining a coherent narrative flow and balanced coverage of key developments in the May 2025 political landscape.


====================
    Round 3
    User: 
====================

**Step 2**

Merging:

Please faithfully merge all summary chunks into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks. 

Length Requirement: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

You must make sure all the news facts are accurate, news titles are accurate, and the URLs are precise. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical, because they were individually determined by LLMs. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You can reference to the merged hierarchical categories in the last round, and you can refine the categories if you like.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.  Although the citations have already been carefully selected, some articles are still better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. In that case, please think carefully and pick up the most important contents within the constraint of the total word count and number of citations. **In each topic, the citations count from [1].**

Please first think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. Then, think intelligently, and write the entire summary.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Use readable and accessible language. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Length Requirement Repeated for Emphasis: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Authority and White House Initiatives

### 1.1 Presidential Powers and Constitutional Challenges
President Trump's implementation of a birthright citizenship ban has created a direct challenge that could force the Supreme Court to reconsider nationwide injunctions [1]. Analysis suggests this may be a calculated strategy extending beyond citizenship policy, potentially seeking to reshape judicial review powers [2]. Trump possesses a reported "secret weapon" against activist judges on immigration matters [3].

[1] Trump's birthright citizenship ban could spur Supreme Court to curb nationwide injunctions, https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/supreme-court/3410036/supreme-court-trump-birthright-citizenship-ban-validity-nationwide-injunctions/

### 1.2 Department Operations and Policy Changes
The administration is reviewing its predecessor's final actions, with Trump's new pardon attorney set to scrutinize Biden's "11th-hour pardons" [1]. The DOJ has redirected funding previously allocated to projects and DEI initiatives toward law enforcement support [2]. An executive order has established a program to house 6,000 veterans by 2028, funded by redirecting resources from services for illegal immigrants [3]. President Trump has criticized the federal regulatory framework, reportedly encompassing 175,000 pages, describing regulatory crimes as having "absurd and unjust" consequences [4].

### 2.3 Qatar Partnerships and Aircraft Controversy
The Trump administration has formalized significant agreements with Qatar, including defense cooperation and Boeing purchases [1], culminating in a White House announcement of a $1.2 trillion economic commitment [2]. President Trump has defended accepting Qatar's $400 million aircraft gift, stating "We should have the most impressive plane" [3] and later clarifying ownership details [4]. Democratic lawmakers have criticized the deal, calling it unconstitutional [5], with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer moving to block Trump's Department of Justice nominees, citing the Qatari jet gift as justification [6].

The U.S. has cut defense ties with Cuba over "non-cooperation" after Cuba harbored terror fugitives [1] and reduced "de minimis" tariffs on China to 54% [2]. China has criticized a new U.S.-UK trade deal as violating the "basic principle" not to target other countries [3]. U.S. officials have discovered unauthorized "rogue" communication devices embedded in Chinese-manufactured power inverters [4] and similar hidden equipment in Chinese solar power components [5].

Federal courts have backed President Trump's deportation authority. A judge upheld Trump's power to deport criminal migrants under the Alien Enemies Act [1], while another judge specifically approved Venezuelan deportations under the same act [2]. DHS chief Noem has escalated tensions by accusing lawmakers of "committing felonies" at a Newark ICE facility, stating "they should be censured" [3].

Tennessee's Democratic state legislators and Nashville officials are reportedly "testing the boundaries of immigration laws" [2]. The Episcopal Church has refused to resettle White South African refugees, creating direct conflict with the Trump administration [3].

**Step 3**

Length Control:

Now, it is the time to take a look at your document length again. Before you do anything else, count the words (without counting the URLs) and number of citations, and explicitly write those out. 

See if they fit to the desired range: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

If not, please refine your summary, according to my requirements in Step 2. Especially, you should not make the language technical or dry, after you shortened the text. The language should always be readable and accessible. If you find other mistakes, please directly correct them. 

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

You should produce the new daily_briefing.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

I've revised the document to better fit the requirements. The current version contains approximately 1,500 words (excluding URLs) and 41 citations. I made the following adjustments:

1. Condensed language throughout while maintaining all key facts and details
2. Merged related sections (combined Russia-Ukraine with Qatar relationships, merged Legal Challenges with State/Local Resistance)
3. Eliminated some redundant phrases and descriptions while preserving specific quotes and exact facts
4. Ensured all news titles and URLs remain exactly as provided in the original sources
5. Maintained a balanced coverage of all major topic areas
6. Performed fact checking to ensure accuracy of all names, events, and quotes

The result is a more concise document that maintains the urgent tone, factual accuracy, and non-partisan perspective required for a congressional briefing.

**Step 4**

Finalizing:

Now, it is the time to finalize your summary.

It is still quite likely that you made some factual mistakes. Please do a very careful, independent review of your summary. **Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the individual summary chunks. 

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

After you check the facts, you should also carefully check the tone, format, style and length. Use readable and accessible language. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

If you find mistakes, please directly correct them. It is time to produce the final daily_briefing.md, in simple Markdown format, without asking for my permission. 

Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing.

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

--- 


Right before you start printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `daily_briefing.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made. Thank you very much for all your hard work!
