DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Congress and Federal Legislation

### 1.1 GOP "Megabill" Hits Procedural Crisis in Senate

The Republican majority is encountering a significant procedural crisis in its effort to pass President Trump’s signature legislative package, referred to in headlines as the "One Big, Beautiful Bill." The Senate Parliamentarian, enforcing the Byrd Rule that governs budget reconciliation, has found that multiple provisions within the massive bill are non-compliant [1]. A key provision impacting Medicaid is among those found to violate the rules, a development that has sent GOP leadership scrambling to find a viable path forward and salvage the administration's top legislative priority [2, 3]. In a separate but related setback, a tax measure described as a “‘revenge’ tax provision" was reportedly removed from the bill after an explicit request was made by the Treasury Department [4]. These challenges place the bill's passage in serious jeopardy.

### 1.2 Republican Oversight and Legislative Initiatives Advance

Beyond the reconciliation bill, Congressional Republicans are pursuing other legislative and oversight goals. Senate Republicans are reprising a push to finance tax cuts by slashing funding for the food stamp program [1]. In the House, the GOP has advanced a bill that opponents characterize as an effort at "'gutting' government watchdog" agencies [2]. Simultaneously, several Republican senators have introduced a proposal to significantly slash the size of the intelligence office currently led by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard [3]. Following what they term "damning reporting" from ProPublica, a group of senators is now demanding a formal investigation into canceled contracts at the Department of Veterans Affairs [4]. In a separate matter, the House GOP's ongoing probe into former President Biden’s age has resulted in the issuance of a subpoena for a former top aide to Jill Biden [5].

## 2. Foreign Policy and National Security

### 2.1 Iran Strikes Spark Outrage and Legal Threats from White House

The administration's recent military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities have triggered significant domestic and international fallout. President Trump's reported comparison of the strikes to the atomic bombings of Japan has sparked global "outrage" [1]. In the aftermath, President Trump has threatened legal action against both CNN and The New York Times, with his lawyer asserting their coverage "undermined the credibility and integrity of President Trump" [2]. The administration's official assessment of the operational success is also facing scrutiny. Following a classified briefing, Senate Democrats have publicly questioned the White House's claim regarding the "obliteration" of the Iranian sites [3]. Compounding the diplomatic tension, Iran has formally dismissed a U.S. assertion that nuclear negotiations are scheduled to resume next week, creating further uncertainty [4].

### 2.2 Shifts in Intelligence Sharing, Alliances, and International Law

The administration is reportedly altering its approach to intelligence protocols and key alliances. One analysis suggests that President Trump's recent dismissal of intelligence assessments is consistent with his "long distrust of spy agencies" [1]. This posture appears to be translating into policy, with a report indicating the White House plans to limit the intelligence it provides to Congress following a recent document leak [2]. In another significant move, Reuters reports that President Trump is seeking to slash U.S. funding for international war crimes investigations [3]. In direct diplomatic engagement, the President has reportedly urged the Israeli government to "Cancel Criminal Trial Against Netanyahu" [4].

## 3. Judiciary and Justice System

### 3.1 Supreme Court Rulings Impact Healthcare, Citizenship, and Public Space

The Supreme Court has issued several consequential rulings with more expected imminently. In a landmark healthcare decision, the Court cleared a path for states to deny Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood [1]. The ruling has been characterized by some commentators as a "devastating blow to women" and more destructive than it sounds [2]. The Court is also expected to rule soon on whether to permit the enforcement of President Trump's executive order aimed at limiting birthright citizenship, a case with profound constitutional implications [3]. Following a separate decision that permits cities to ban public camping, localities particularly in California have already begun to take action based on the new precedent [4]. The Court has announced it will release its next set of opinions on Friday, June 27, 2025 [5].

### 3.2 Other Legal System Developments

Beyond the Supreme Court, other significant legal events are unfolding. A federal judge has issued an order blocking an executive action that compelled Colorado state employees to comply with ICE subpoenas, marking a setback for federal immigration enforcement efforts in the state [1]. Separately, retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, an appointee of President Reagan, has issued a stark public warning, stating that he believes “‘democracy is at risk’” [2].

## 4. The Executive Branch

### 4.1 Agency Actions on Public Safety, Health, and Domestic Affairs

Multiple federal agencies are implementing policy shifts with direct domestic impact. As hurricane season intensifies, reports indicate that federal access to a "Key Forecasting Tool" for storm prediction is set to end, raising concerns about public safety in vulnerable areas [1]. Concurrently, state emergency management leaders are signaling fear that critical response funding from FEMA "may be drying up" [2]. In public health, a CDC panel under the direction of Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has reportedly moved to discontinue certain flu shots, a decision one outlet attributes to the use of "anti-vaccine junk data" [3]. In a domestic military matter, veterans' advocates are reporting "low morale" among troops deployed to Los Angeles, with some personnel quoted as saying, "This Is Not What We Signed Up For" [4].

### 4.2 Administration Controversies and Investigations

The administration is navigating multiple active controversies. The Department of Justice is reportedly applying pressure on the President of the University of Virginia to resign from his position [1]. In another developing story, the administration is said to be "quietly" moving to drop charges against leaders of the MS-13 gang, citing unspecified "other national security priorities" as the reason for the shift [2]. On matters of executive clemency, it is reported that pardon applications are now being "carefully crafted with one man in mind: Donald Trump," suggesting a highly personalized process [3].

## 5. Economic Policy and Performance

### 5.1 Trade Wars and Global Economic Realignment

The administration's aggressive trade policies continue to generate significant international and domestic economic effects. In a major strategic response, European Union leaders are reportedly exploring the creation of a "world trade club without US" to counteract President Trump's tariff-heavy approach [1]. This follows the release of revised U.S. economic data showing a "stark drop in GDP growth," as businesses rushed to secure imports before the president’s global trade war fully materialized [2]. The impact of this conflict is tangible at a local level, where U.S. ports have reportedly "felt the crush of Trump’s tariffs" [3]. In a separate development concerning supply chains, the administration has announced a deal with Beijing intended to "expedite rare earth exports from China" [4].

### 5.2 Domestic Budget, Spending, and Social Safety Net Concerns

Proposed changes to the federal budget, particularly concerning social programs, are creating widespread public concern. Multiple reports highlight that families in states that supported President Trump are now expressing deep angst over proposed Republican cuts to Medicaid, with many calling the services "'not a luxury'" [1]. This sentiment is echoed in broader reporting that indicates Americans are bracing for welfare cuts, with one report citing individuals worried about their ability to afford food, stating, "Our food doesn't even last the month" [2]. Amid these fiscal debates, President Trump has indicated a desire to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, whom he publicly referred to as "'terrible' and 'stupid'" [3].

## 6. Immigration and Border Enforcement

### 6.1 ICE Operations Target Long-Term Residents, Sparking Outrage

Recent operations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have resulted in several controversial incidents involving individuals with established U.S. residency. Reports detail the arrest of a U.S. citizen, which their family termed a "'kidnapping'" [1], and the detention of an Iranian woman who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years while she was gardening [2]. In another case, a Canadian citizen and lawful permanent resident since 1991 reportedly died in ICE custody [3]; a separate report noted he had a prior conviction for drug trafficking [4]. The perceived focus of these operations has drawn political criticism, with Representative Pramila Jayapal stating the agency is targeting "Law-Abiding 'Moms, Dads, Grandparents'—Not Criminals" [5].

### 6.2 Immigration Policy Creates Widespread Disruption and Fear

The administration's broad immigration enforcement strategy is creating significant disruptions and drawing fierce opposition. A proposed migrant detention facility in Florida, dubbed "'Alligator Alcatraz'" by critics, has generated a "chorus of outrage" [1]. The administration's general crackdown on migrants has reportedly left both workers and the firms that employ them "'terrified'" and "worried" about the future [2]. The policy's effects are being felt across professional sectors, as hundreds of international doctors who were scheduled to begin medical residencies in U.S. hospitals are currently in "visa limbo" [3].

## 7. U.S. Politics and Elections

### 7.1 NYC Mayoral Race Upended by Mamdani Win; Other Political Moves Emerge

The New York City mayoral race has entered an unpredictable phase following Zohran Mamdani's victory in the Democratic primary. Despite conceding, Andrew Cuomo will remain on the mayoral ballot for the general election, ensuring a contested race [1]. Mamdani's win on a left-wing populist platform is seen as a significant victory for the progressive movement and has caused "hysteria" among the city's real estate developers [2, 3]. In response, billionaire Bill Ackman is reportedly seeking to recruit and fund a challenger to run against him [4]. In other political news, reports indicate Elise Stefanik is preparing to launch a campaign for New York governor [5], and Eric Trump has opened the door to the family seeking a "political dynasty" [6].

### 7.2 Polling Shows Public Unease Despite 2024 Election Outcome

Recent polling data presents a complex and potentially challenging political environment for the administration. While a post-election analysis concluded that President Trump won in 2024 by turning out his base and building a "diverse coalition" that included a near-majority of Latino voters [1, 2], current public sentiment appears negative. A new poll shows the President’s approval rating is "underwater on seven key issues" [3]. Corroborating this, another survey finds that a clear majority of voters believe the country is on the "wrong track" under the current leadership [4].
