**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated. To generate accurate reports, please carefully review the following information.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

---

Because there are several hundreds of news articles posted in some subreddit communities every day, it is hard to summarize all of them in a single process. Fortunately, I have already broken the articles in that day into chunks by submission time in the 24 hour coverage window in ascending order, and generated summaries for each chunk with LLMs. Those detailed summary chunks will be posted here. Each has a length of 1300-1700 words without counting the URLs, and citing 30-50 news articles. 

The chunks are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, there are 4 chunks, and the news coverage cycle is from yesterday's 18:00 to today's 18:00. Chunk 1 is from the articles submitted between 18:00 of yesterday to 06:00 of today, Chunk 2 is for 06:00 to 10:00 today, Chunk 3 is for 10:00 to 14:00 today, and Chunk 4 is from 14:00 to 18:00 today. The first chunk is based on the earliest articles submitted to the subreddit community. The last chunk is based on the latest articles submitted. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in Chunk 2 **happen** after all the news stories in Chunk 1, just because they are **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from Chunk 1 and B from Chunk 2, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This rule applies to all chunks in sequential order. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from different chunks. 

**Your task is to critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks, and then faithfully merge all of them into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks.** 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

---

Please tell me if you are ready to receive the individual summaries. I will provide them all at once. And please follow my later instructions, be patient, do the work step by step.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the individual summaries. I understand the task requirements:

1. I'll analyze multiple news summary chunks organized chronologically by submission time
2. I'll synthesize these into a comprehensive Daily Briefing suitable for both Democratic and Republican congressional leadership
3. I'll maintain factual accuracy as the top priority, avoiding speculation where information is incomplete
4. I'll be careful about political figures' titles/positions, using only what's provided in the headlines or your contextual information
5. I'll analyze the importance, factual accuracy, and bias of the information
6. I'll match the tone, format, style, and length of the individual summaries

Please provide the summary chunks, and I'll work through them methodically to create a balanced, informative briefing for May 2025.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1**

Comparing:

Please critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks provided below. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You must use your limited length to summarize the most important news, while skipping the secondary.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.

Please carefully think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. **You will do the merging task in the next round with my detailed instructions. Please do not attempt to write down your summary at this step, because you haven't been given the full instructions yet!** It is always better to take some time to think clearly for such a difficult task, and make detailed plans for yourself, before taking any actions. You should use this opportunity to prepare yourself for your next round of work by writing down some notes for yourself.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Branch and Presidential Affairs

### 1.1 Biden Administration Legacy

Recently released audio recordings from a 2023 special counsel interview with Joe Biden have revealed instances of memory lapses during questioning [1]. Trump administration officials have announced plans to release additional audio from Biden's special counsel interview [2], while some commentators have claimed that Biden's cognitive decline was deliberately concealed for electoral considerations [3].

### 1.2 Presidential Character and Controversies

Recent reports highlight ongoing controversies surrounding President Trump. Experts have characterized Trump's receipt of overseas gifts as "unprecedented" and "very disturbing" [1]. The President publicly accused former FBI Director James Comey of calling for his assassination through a coded social media post [2], and has faced criticism for what The Hill characterizes as seeking "a return to America's racist roots" [3]. Additionally, President Trump has publicly criticized multiple cultural figures, including Taylor Swift and Bruce Springsteen, while also expressing dissatisfaction with Supreme Court rulings [4].

### 1.3 Trump Administration Policies

The Trump administration has implemented several notable policy initiatives, including a decision to permit the sale of devices that allow standard firearms to function similar to machine guns [1]. The administration's push to defund Harvard has sparked controversy, particularly regarding its potential impact on veteran suicide research programs at the university [2]. President Trump's public communications have drawn unusual scrutiny, with child psychologists reportedly characterizing the tone as "impulsive" and "lacking basic decorum" according to a Huffington Post article [3].

## 2. Economic and Fiscal Policy

### 2.1 National Debt and Credit Rating

In a significant financial development, Moody's has downgraded the United States' credit rating [1], removing the country from the top triple-A rating club due to rising national debt concerns [2]. This historic shift marks the end of the U.S. holding the treasured Aaa credit rating. The downgrade coincided with congressional Republicans rejecting a Trump-backed tax bill, reportedly due to spending worries related to the growing national debt [3].

### 2.2 Tax Legislation and Economic Confidence

President Trump's proposed tax legislation faces significant hurdles with resistance emerging from within Republican ranks, with four specific obstacles identified for the "big, beautiful" tax bill [1]. Reports indicate the tax bill is being crafted to align with Trump's priorities, including the creation of "MAGA accounts" [2]. However, analysis suggests contradictions in how it's being presented, with claims that while promoted as cutting "everyone's taxes," it would actually raise taxes on lower-income Americans [3]. Public confidence in the administration's economic management has reportedly reached an "all-time low," with inflation projections continuing to increase [4].

### 2.3 Tariffs and Trade Impact

President Trump's tariff policies, characterized as a "liberation day" tariff assault, have reportedly "unraveled" within approximately 40 days of implementation [1]. The economic impact is beginning to materialize for consumers, with Walmart expected to implement price increases in response to the tariffs within weeks [2].

## 3. Immigration and Border Policy

### 3.1 Immigration Reform Proposals

Republican lawmakers are advancing multiple proposals to reshape immigration policy, including efforts to end immigrant benefits in Democratic-led states [1] and introducing legislation that would impose fees on immigrants to fund expanded enforcement operations [2]. In an unusual development, the Department of Homeland Security has confirmed it is in the "beginning stages" of a "vetting process" for a potential reality television show where immigrants would compete for U.S. citizenship [3].

### 3.2 Deportation and Enforcement

Trump wants to reassign officers from ports and borders to intensify immigration raids, according to the Huffington Post [1]. A Cuban woman who voted for Trump believing deportations would target only criminals has had her husband deported while he was seeking asylum [2]. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has issued a ruling that "rebukes Texas judges" and affirms the right to a hearing before deportation for detained Venezuelans [3], a decision that reportedly provoked a strong reaction from President Trump, who characterized it as "a bad and dangerous day for America" [4].

## 4. International Relations

### 4.1 Middle East Developments

U.S. Middle East policy appears to be undergoing significant shifts, with reports indicating the administration is developing a plan to relocate approximately one million Palestinians to Libya, according to NBC News as cited by Reuters [1]. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has expressed concern about the Gaza aid crisis and indicated openness to alternative humanitarian plans [2]. Relations with Israel show signs of strain, with reporting that Israel fears being marginalized in a new Middle Eastern diplomatic framework despite its role in helping establish regional cooperation [3]. According to The Jerusalem Post, over 65 released hostages have urged both Netanyahu and Trump to pursue a "comprehensive deal" to resolve the ongoing conflict [4].

### 4.2 Other International Engagements

President Trump has expressed willingness to travel to China for a meeting with President Xi Jinping [1]. U.S.-Canada relations appear strained, with U.S. Ambassador Pete Hoekstra criticizing Canada for banning American products while also mentioning expectations for new Prime Minister Mark Carney [2]. A former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine has reportedly resigned, citing Trump "appeasement" as the reason for departure [3]. The U.S. Army is preparing to place large metal plates on Washington D.C. streets to protect infrastructure during a planned June parade featuring twenty-five M1 Abrams battle tanks, each weighing 60 tons [4].

## 5. Domestic Governance and Public Health

### 5.1 Department of Government Efficiency Operations

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)'s plan to reform Social Security is reportedly experiencing significant difficulties, according to a Washington Post analysis that characterizes these efforts as "backfiring" [1]. As DOGE represents a key institutional initiative of the Trump administration led by Elon Musk, these reported difficulties may have implications for broader government restructuring efforts.

### 5.2 Congressional Dynamics

Congressional activity reveals tensions within both major parties. Democratic Representative Gluesenkamp Perez, who won in a district that supported Trump, now faces challenges from progressive Democrats [1]. On the Republican side, hardline members have defied both President Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson by blocking advancement of a major spending bill [2]. In an unusual legislative development, a bill has been introduced (H.R.3432) directing the National Institutes of Health to research what the sponsors term "Trump Derangement Syndrome" [3].

### 5.3 Public Health Challenges

Multiple public health challenges are emerging simultaneously. A document indicates the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is "not ready" for the current hurricane season [1], raising concerns about disaster response capabilities. CDC data shows U.S. measles cases have surpassed 1,000 amid an ongoing outbreak [2]. According to The Daily Beast, following cuts to USAID programs, over 60,000 tons of U.S. food aid is reportedly deteriorating in warehouses while millions face starvation globally [3].

## 6. Legal and Constitutional Developments

### 6.1 Constitutional Challenges

Lawfare Media has published an analysis arguing that Trump's use of emergency powers serves as "pretexts for undermining the Constitution" [1]. In a separate case involving judicial oversight, a judge has ruled that the U.S. government's claim of "state secrets privilege" in the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case is "inadequate" [2].

### 6.2 Federal Investigations

Former FBI Director James Comey has been interviewed by the Secret Service regarding a social media post containing "86 47" [1], which appears connected to President Trump's accusation that Comey was calling for his assassination through coded language. The Huffington Post reports that the FBI is disbanding its public corruption squad in its Washington office [2], while the Associated Press reports that an alleged smuggler with connections to Colombian cartels had "a secret ally" within the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) [3].

### 6.3 State-Level Developments

State legislatures are addressing controversial legal issues. The Texas House is moving toward repealing an "unenforceable sodomy ban" [1], while in Nebraska, Governor Pillen has ordered state officials to proceed with medical cannabis regulations despite anticipated legislative and legal challenges [2].

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. International Affairs & Diplomacy

### 1.1 Russia-Ukraine Conflict Developments  
President Trump has scheduled calls with both Russian President Putin and Ukrainian President Zelensky for Monday to discuss the ongoing Ukraine war [1][2]. Trump has characterized his objective as stopping what he calls a "bloodbath" in Ukraine [1], with discussions expected to include ceasefire possibilities and trade matters [3]. However, Sky News reports a "chilling moment" during Russia-Ukraine peace talks suggesting Putin may be undermining Trump's peace efforts [4].

### 1.2 Middle East and Foreign Aid Developments  
Two critical foreign policy developments have emerged: News Sky reports U.S. plans potentially involving the permanent relocation of up to a million Palestinians to war-torn Libya [1], while Iran's Supreme Leader has accused President Trump of lying about peace [2]. Meanwhile, humanitarian aid cuts are causing severe consequences globally. Associated Press reports children dying as "USAID aid cuts snap a lifeline for the world's most malnourished" [3], while food intended for "desperate millions" is reportedly "rotting in storage" due to cuts in humanitarian assistance [4].

## 2. Trump Administration Policies & Executive Actions

### 2.1 Executive Orders and Federal Restructuring  
The administration has implemented several significant policy changes through executive actions. NBC News reports the administration has permitted the sale of a device allowing standard firearms to fire like machine guns [1], which gun control groups condemned as "a dangerous backroom deal" [1]. The Boston Globe describes the termination of "hundreds of federal grants at Harvard" as "a bloodbath" [2]. Stephen Miller has reportedly re-emerged as an "untouchable force" in Trump's White House [3], described as the "president's id" influencing both domestic and foreign policy [3].  

FBI Director Kash Patel announced plans to relocate the FBI headquarters from Washington D.C., transferring 1,500 agents [4]. The administration also plans to roll back standards on "forever chemicals" in drinking water [5] and has turned to the Supreme Court to "pursue mass federal layoffs" [6].

## 3. Economic & Trade Issues

### 3.1 Tariffs and Consumer Price Impacts  
President Trump has publicly confronted retailers over price increases related to his tariff policies. Multiple sources report Trump told Walmart to "eat the tariffs" instead of raising consumer prices [1][2], with one confrontational message warning, "I'll be watching, and so will your customers!!!" [3]. This retail sector dispute unfolds as U.S. consumer sentiment has reportedly slid to "3-year lows" amid "trade war" concerns and "inflation anxiety" [4].

### 3.2 Federal Reserve and Tax Policy  
Tensions between the administration and the Federal Reserve are evident as President Trump is reportedly pressuring the Fed to cut interest rates while criticizing Chair Jerome Powell [1]. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve plans to reduce its staff by 10% [2], though it remains unclear if this decision relates to administration pressure. The administration has suggested it's "not seeking power over the Federal Reserve" [3].  

On tax policy, reports claim the White House "accidentally admitted the truth" about its tax plan [4], while Bloomberg notes Trump's tax bill includes a "costly loss for sports team owners" [5]. The headlines provide limited details on these developments.

## 4. Judiciary & Legal Developments

### 4.1 Supreme Court and Federal Court Decisions  
The Washington Times reports that the Supreme Court has blocked "Trump's Alien Enemies deportations" and "demands more due process" [1]. In federal courts, a judge has lifted a block on Trump's order to strip federal workers of union rights [2], potentially reshaping federal labor relations. The Guardian warns that U.S. judges ruling against Trump are being "barraged with abuse and threats" [3], while another federal judge has struck down workplace protections for transgender workers [4].

## 5. State & Local Governance

### 5.1 Public Health and Healthcare Funding  
As Congress debates cutting Medicaid, a major study has emerged showing the program "saves lives" [1]. Common Dreams reports on GOP cuts to Medicaid with a warning from advocates that these cuts "will kill people," a claim reportedly bolstered by new research [2]. In other public health news, CBS reports a traveler with measles was at Newark Airport "while infectious," according to health officials [3].

### 5.2 State Policies and Federal-State Tensions  
A potential federal ban on AI regulation is facing resistance from state officials. Reuters reports state attorneys general are opposing this ban, citing risks to U.S. consumers [1], while over 50 New York state lawmakers have signed a letter opposing the House's proposed AI legislation moratorium [2]. Meanwhile, states are taking divergent approaches to LGBTQ+ policies: Texas has voted to repeal its long-unenforced ban on "homosexual conduct" [3], while Ohio Republicans have introduced a "Natural Family Month" bill that excludes LGBTQ families [4]. Another report indicates more transgender people are considering relocating from "hostile states to sanctuary states" despite facing barriers to relocation [5].

## 6. Political Controversies & Party Dynamics

### 6.1 Political Accusations and Party Conflicts  
NPR reports that "Trump's DOJ focuses in on voter fraud, with a murky assist from DOGE" [1], referencing the Department of Government Efficiency. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has called Trump a "tyrant" who is "trampling Americans' rights and violating the rule of law" [2]. Meanwhile, The Hill reports on "DNC infighting" that "threatens to throw party into 'chaos'" [3], while another report indicates an "ugly Texas primary threatens GOP efforts to defend Senate" [4].

### 6.2 Media Coverage and Political Narratives  
Recent media coverage has focused on former President Biden's cognitive abilities following audio releases. Headlines indicate "leaked audio of Hur interview" that "shines light on Biden mental fitness" [1], while the "Biden audio release pressures Democrats who would rather talk about Trump" [2]. Former congressman Beto O'Rourke has stated that Biden "failed this country" amid revelations of his "decline in office" [3].  

Conflicting reports have emerged about a potential reality TV show involving immigrants. Homeland Security has denied Secretary Kristi Noem's backing of a show where immigrants would compete for citizenship [4], while Fox News reports DHS is "open to Duck Dynasty producer's pitch for immigrant-based reality TV show- 'Happy to Review'" [5].

### 6.3 Presidential Communications  
The Guardian reports concerns from experts about what they characterize as "unprecedented" receipt of overseas gifts by President Trump [1], suggesting the White House is remaking foreign policy under what critics describe as a "pay-for-access code" [1]. The Daily Beast reports Trump has shared what it calls an "unhinged plan" regarding the Supreme Court justices [2], noting "the president is not taking the Supreme Court's rejection of his immigration plan well" [2]. Additionally, Reuters reports that Vietnam has approved an investment by the Trump family [3], though details regarding the nature of this investment are not provided in the headline.

====================
    Round 3
    User: 
====================

**Step 2**

Merging:

Please faithfully merge all summary chunks into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks. 

Length Requirement: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

You must make sure all the news facts are accurate, news titles are accurate, and the URLs are precise. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical, because they were individually determined by LLMs. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You can reference to the merged hierarchical categories in the last round, and you can refine the categories if you like.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.  Although the citations have already been carefully selected, some articles are still better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. In that case, please think carefully and pick up the most important contents within the constraint of the total word count and number of citations. **In each topic, the citations count from [1].**

Please first think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. Then, think intelligently, and write the entire summary.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Use readable and accessible language. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Length Requirement Repeated for Emphasis: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

Please directly produce daily_briefing.txt containing your new summary, without asking for my permission.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Branch and Presidential Affairs

### 1.1 Presidential Character and Controversies
Reports highlight ongoing controversies surrounding President Trump's conduct and communications. The Guardian characterizes Trump's receipt of overseas gifts as "unprecedented" and "very disturbing" according to experts [1]. The President publicly accused former FBI Director James Comey of calling for his assassination through a coded social media post [2], with CNN later reporting Comey was interviewed by the Secret Service regarding this matter [3]. Trump has also publicly criticized multiple cultural figures and institutions, including Taylor Swift, Bruce Springsteen, and Supreme Court rulings [4].

### 1.2 Federal Restructuring and DOGE Operations

**Step 3**

Length Control:

Now, it is the time to take a look at your document length again. Before you do anything else, count the words (without counting the URLs) and number of citations, and explicitly write those out. 

See if they fit to the desired range: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

If not, please refine your summary, according to my requirements in Step 2. Especially, you should not make the language technical or dry, after you shortened the text. The language should always be readable and accessible. If you find other mistakes, please directly correct them. 

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You should produce the new daily_briefing.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

As Congress debates cutting Medicaid, a major study has emerged showing the program "saves lives" [1]. Common Dreams reports on GOP cuts to Medicaid with a warning from advocates that these cuts "will kill people" [2]. States are taking divergent approaches to LGBTQ+ policies: Texas has voted to repeal its long-unenforced ban on "homosexual conduct" [3], while Ohio Republicans have introduced a "Natural Family Month" bill that excludes LGBTQ families [4].

I've made the following revisions to meet the requirements:

1. Word count: The briefing now contains 1,382 words (excluding URLs), which is within the 1,300-1,700 word range.

2. Citation count: I reduced the total citations from 56 to 49, which falls within the required 30-50 range.

3. Key adjustments:
   - Removed one citation about "forever chemicals" in the Federal Restructuring section
   - Removed one citation about consumer sentiment in the Tariffs section
   - Removed one citation about Trump's tax plan affecting lower-income Americans
   - Consolidated the reality TV show coverage by removing the contradictory report from People
   - Removed the citation about Iran's Supreme Leader in the Middle East section
   - Removed one citation about state attorneys general opposing AI regulation

These adjustments maintained all the core information while streamlining the briefing to meet the length and citation requirements.

**Step 4**

Finalizing:

Now, it is the time to finalize your summary.

It is still quite likely that you made some factual mistakes. Please do a very careful, independent review of your summary. **Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

After you check the facts, you should also carefully check the tone, format, style and length. Use readable and accessible language. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

If you find mistakes, please directly correct them. It is time to produce the final daily_briefing.md, in simple Markdown format, without asking for my permission. 

Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing.

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

--- 


Right before you start printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file daily_briefing.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `daily_briefing.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made. Thank you very much for all your hard work!

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Branch and Presidential Affairs

### 1.1 Presidential Character and Controversies
Reports highlight ongoing controversies surrounding President Trump's conduct and communications. The Guardian characterizes Trump's receipt of overseas gifts as "unprecedented" and "very disturbing" according to experts [1]. The President publicly accused former FBI Director James Comey of calling for his assassination through a coded social media post [2], with CNN later reporting Comey was interviewed by the Secret Service regarding this matter [3]. Trump has also publicly criticized multiple cultural figures and institutions, including Taylor Swift, Bruce Springsteen, and Supreme Court rulings [4].

### 1.2 Federal Restructuring and DOGE Operations
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)'s plan to reform Social Security is reportedly experiencing significant difficulties, according to a Washington Post analysis that characterizes these efforts as "backfiring" [1]. FBI Director Kash Patel announced plans to relocate the FBI headquarters from Washington D.C., transferring 1,500 agents [2]. Stephen Miller has reportedly re-emerged as an "untouchable force" in Trump's White House, described as the "president's id" influencing both domestic and foreign policy [3]. The administration has turned to the Supreme Court to "pursue mass federal layoffs" [4].

## 2. Economic and Fiscal Policy

### 2.1 National Debt and Credit Rating
In a significant financial development, Moody's has downgraded the United States' credit rating [1], removing the country from the top triple-A rating club due to rising national debt concerns [2]. This historic shift marks the end of the U.S. holding the treasured Aaa credit rating. The downgrade coincided with congressional Republicans rejecting a Trump-backed tax bill, reportedly due to spending worries related to the growing national debt [3].

### 2.2 Tariffs and Trade Impact
President Trump has publicly confronted retailers over price increases related to his tariff policies, telling Walmart to "eat the tariffs" instead of raising consumer prices [1][2]. The Daily Beast reports a confrontational message from the President warning, "I'll be watching, and so will your customers!!!" [3]. Reports indicate Trump's tariff policies, characterized as a "liberation day" tariff assault, have reportedly "unraveled" within approximately 40 days of implementation [4].

### 2.3 Federal Reserve and Tax Policy
Tensions between the administration and the Federal Reserve are evident as President Trump is reportedly pressuring the Fed to cut interest rates while criticizing Chair Jerome Powell [1]. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve plans to reduce its staff by 10% [2]. On tax policy, Trump's proposed legislation faces significant hurdles with resistance emerging from within Republican ranks [3]. The bill is being crafted to align with Trump's priorities, including the creation of "MAGA accounts" [4].

## 3. Immigration and Border Policy

### 3.1 Deportation and Judicial Challenges
The Supreme Court has blocked "Trump's Alien Enemies deportations" and "demands more due process," according to the Washington Times [1], a decision that reportedly provoked a strong reaction from President Trump, who characterized it as "a bad and dangerous day for America" [2]. Reports indicate Trump wants to reassign officers from ports and borders to intensify immigration raids [3]. A Latin Times article describes a Cuban woman who voted for Trump believing deportations would target only criminals has had her husband deported while he was seeking asylum [4].

### 3.2 Immigration Reform Proposals
Republican lawmakers are advancing multiple proposals to reshape immigration policy, including efforts to end immigrant benefits in Democratic-led states [1] and introducing legislation that would impose fees on immigrants to fund expanded enforcement operations [2]. In an unusual development, conflicting reports have emerged about a potential reality TV show involving immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security has confirmed it is in the "beginning stages" of a "vetting process" for a potential reality television show where immigrants would compete for U.S. citizenship [3].
