### 3.1 Deportation and "Remigration" Initiatives  
The Trump administration is advancing plans to establish an "Office of Remigration" focused on immigrant removal.

## 4. International Relations

### 4.1 China and Russia Relations  
U.S. officials have attributed recent actions against China to frustration with trade negotiations [1]. Senator Chuck Grassley has advocated for sanctions to end the Ukraine war, suggesting they could signal to Putin that his military campaign is unsustainable [2].
