# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Branch Actions

### 1.1 Immigration and Visa Policies

The Trump administration's deportation policies are creating immediate life‐threatening situations. A 4‐year‐old with a critical medical condition faces deportation that doctors warn could be "fatal within a matter of days" [1]. In another case, a gay man was deported to a country where he was subsequently raped, with allegations that administration officials "lied to the judge twice" during proceedings [2]. Student visa processing has been halted completely [3] as the administration prepares to implement "expanded social media vetting" for all foreign students [4]. Immigration enforcement has intensified at routine proceedings, with ICE arresting a high school student at what was described as a "routine immigration hearing" [5]. Border security has drawn scrutiny—not only for its cost, with reports that the Border Czar's security detail costs "taxpayers $1 million a month" [6]—but also amid claims that Trump's Border Czar profited from a top ICE contractor before taking a White House gig [7].

### 1.2 Federal Funding Decisions

The administration has implemented major funding reductions across multiple sectors. Veterans Affairs is facing "sweeping cuts" [1] while educational institutions have been singled out; President Trump has moved to "yank all remaining federal funds to Harvard" – language he used by describing the Ivy League school as "very antisemitic" [2]. Policy leverage is evident in funding threats too—California's federal funding has been threatened over a transgender athlete issue [3]. The administration's approach to public media has also come under fire, with NPR filing suit "over executive order to cut federal funding to public media" [4]. Personal political insults have also emerged in funding debates; Trump shared a social media post referring to former President Biden as a "decrepit corpse" soon after Biden's cancer diagnosis was publicized [5].

### 1.3 Presidential Pardons and Department Affairs

President Trump is using his pardon power extensively for political allies. The administration has issued pardons for "political allies and loyalists" [1], with his new pardon attorney personally reviewing an application for Stewart Rhodes, described as a "Jan. 6 ringleader" [2]. Pardons have also been extended to reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, previously convicted of bank fraud and tax crimes [3]. Meanwhile, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is driving agency changes: the Bureau of Land Management ousted an official for "resisting DOGE" [4] while reports indicate DOGE's "5 things emails are dying a slow, quiet death" [5]. At Health and Human Services, Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed barring government scientists from publishing in leading medical journals [6], and his health policies reportedly exclude "most pregnant women or children" [7].

## 2. Foreign Policy

### 2.1 Russia-Ukraine Conflict

Military tensions with Russia are intensifying as the U.S. reinforces Europe's northern front amid fears of a wider conflict [1]. President Trump has presented contradictory messages: on one hand admitting he has "no way to make Putin stop" as bombs fall on Kyiv [2], and on the other claiming he has protected Russia from "really bad things" [3]. In further statements, Trump warned Putin that he was "playing with fire" and suggested that Russia had avoided severe consequences thanks to his intervention [4]. These remarks have drawn harsh criticism from Russian media [5] and even triggered responses from automated online accounts [6].

### 2.2 International Trade and Diplomacy

Diplomatic efforts under the current administration face significant challenges. A ceasefire agreement negotiated to release hostages was rejected by Israel, with blame assigned to Hamas [1]. U.S. trade relations have deteriorated, with the U.S. and EU locked in a "showdown over trade" concerning what Trump wants and what Europe can deliver [2]. Tariff policies are described as causing a "tariff whiplash" – a "death by a thousand cuts" [3]. Meanwhile, international market shifts are evident as "Turkish guns are taking over U.S. and global markets" [4]. Additionally, the State Department has advised against travel to Venezuela due to risks such as torture and kidnapping [5]. In a peculiar diplomatic twist, Canada reminded Trump that it already has a King [6] after he proposed making Canada the 51st state [7].

## 3. Judicial and Legal Developments

The Supreme Court is entering a decisive phase as it is "poised to decide cases on birthright citizenship, transgender care and religion" [1]. It recently declined to hear the Oak Flat case, which would have paved the way for a large-scale copper mine on sacred Native American land [2]. Meanwhile, executive orders from the administration have sparked legal challenges—one judge blasted an order targeting a major law firm as "Absurd!" [3] and NPR has initiated a lawsuit over funding cuts for public media [4]. There are also broader concerns that Congress and the Supreme Court are "trying to undermine lower court judges" [5].

## 4. Congressional Affairs

### 4.1 Federal Program Battles

A high-stakes battle is underway in Congress over the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared "Hands off SNAP" on the House floor [1], while Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro criticized Republicans for "ripping away Medicaid and SNAP from Pennsylvanians" [2]. There are also concerns that more than 3 million people could lose SNAP benefits under a GOP bill [3]. Meanwhile, tensions over judicial appointments have escalated; Senator Dick Durbin announced plans to "stall Trump U.S. attorney picks," citing delays attributed to JD Vance under Biden's tenure [4].

### 4.2 Political Positioning

Politicians are gearing up for the 2026 election cycle. Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville has announced his bid for Alabama governor in 2026 [1], while Democrats are strategizing to regain ground in the South with a renewed focus on the working class [2]. Meanwhile, Representative Crockett made headlines by "likening Trump to someone who escaped an insane asylum" [3], and discussion has even emerged about recruiting nontraditional candidates, with GOP chatters considering Auburn coach Bruce Pearl for Senate [4].

## 5. Social Issues

### 5.1 Civil Rights and Religious Expression

State policies on gender-affirming care are under scientific scrutiny. A state-commissioned study in Utah found that the ban on gender-affirming pediatric care "cannot be justified" by science, according to a two-year review [1]. Meanwhile, national concerns persist over growing antisemitism and political violence [2]—with one report urging that "Antisemitic DC killings must be a wake-up call for NYC voters" [3]. Environmental and employment issues also arise as chemical plants near Black neighborhoods continue to pollute while hiring few Black workers [4]. In matters of religious expression, Oklahoma's schools will include Bibles despite funding shortfalls [5], Texas lawmakers now require the Ten Commandments in every classroom [6], and state treasurers have reportedly joined a Christian supremacist effort targeting public investments [7].

### 5.2 State Governance

State-level policies continue to evolve. A ruling by the Missouri State Supreme Court led to "Abortions canceled again in Missouri" [1] while in Texas a bill to block abortion pills has temporarily died [2]. Texas is also showing mixed signals—expanding legal cannabis access before a wider ban [3] even as its governor signs a law to enforce age verification on Apple and Google app stores [4]. Urban policy debates continue in New York City, where congestion pricing remains on the agenda [5]. In financial regulation, New York is considering a ban on officials profiting from cryptocurrency [6] amid warnings that "Donald Trump's Media Conglomerate Is Becoming a Bitcoin Reserve" [7].
