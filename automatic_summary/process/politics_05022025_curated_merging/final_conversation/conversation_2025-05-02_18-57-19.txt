    Round 1
    User: 
====================

**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is April, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

---

Because there are several hundreds of news articles posted in some subreddit communities every day, it is hard to summarize all of them in a single process. Fortunately, I have already broken the articles in that day into chunks by submission time in the 24 hour coverage window in ascending order, and generated summaries for each chunk with LLMs. Those detailed summary chunks will be posted here. Each has a length of 1300-1700 words without counting the URLs, and citing 30-50 news articles. 

The chunks are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, there are 4 chunks, and the news coverage cycle is from yesterday's 18:00 to today's 18:00. Chunk 1 is from the articles submitted between 18:00 of yesterday to 06:00 of today, Chunk 2 is for 06:00 to 10:00 today, Chunk 3 is for 10:00 to 14:00 today, and Chunk 4 is from 14:00 to 18:00 today. The first chunk is based on the earliest articles submitted to the subreddit community. The last chunk is based on the latest articles submitted. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in Chunk 2 **happen** after all the news stories in Chunk 1, just because they are **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from Chunk 1 and B from Chunk 2, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This rule applies to all chunks in sequential order. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from different chunks. 

**Your task is to critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks, and then faithfully merge all of them into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks.** 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

---

Please tell me if you are ready to receive the individual summaries. I will provide them all at once. And please follow my later instructions, be patient, do the work step by step.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the individual summaries. I'll analyze them carefully and create a comprehensive Daily Briefing that objectively serves both Democratic and Republican congressional leadership, maintaining awareness of the unique political context you've described for April 2025.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1**

Comparing:

Please critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks provided below. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You must use your limited length to summarize the most important news, while skipping the secondary.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.

Please carefully think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. **You will do the merging task in the next round with my detailed instructions. Please do not attempt to write down your summary at this step, because you haven't been given the full instructions yet!** It is always better to take some time to think clearly for such a difficult task, and make detailed plans for yourself, before taking any actions. You should use this opportunity to prepare yourself for your next round of work by writing down some notes for yourself.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Economic & Trade Policy

### 1.1 Economic Forecasts & Business Impacts  
The U.S. economy faces serious challenges, with a 75% probability of recession reported by economists [1]. Analysis describes an approaching "tidal wave of change" for the economy [2], with the oil industry experiencing significant difficulties under current policies [3]. International business relations show strain, with McDonald's reporting its worst U.S. sales decline since 2020 and warning about "anti-American sentiment" abroad [4]. Some retailers are abandoning the U.S. market entirely in response to new tax policies on small parcels [5].

### 1.2 Tariffs & Trade Relations  
The administration's tariff policies are creating significant economic disruption. A "massive tariff on millions of Americans' purchases" has recently gone into effect [1], while President Trump has eliminated what was described as a "Chinese tariff loophole," raising costs for online goods [2]. Apple's CEO indicates it's "very difficult" to predict tariff costs beyond June [3], noting the company has already relocated approximately half of iPhone production to India and most of its other products for the U.S. from Vietnam [3]. Meanwhile, China is evaluating U.S. overtures to initiate trade talks after "weeks of stalemate" [4].

## 2. Executive Actions & Government Personnel

### 2.1 Executive Powers & Presidential Directives  
President Trump has signed 141 executive orders within his first 100 days in office [1], representing an unprecedented use of executive power. Among these directives is a controversial plan to rename Veterans Day as "Victory Day for World War I" [2], with reports of confusion over historical dates in implementation [3]. These executive orders signify substantial expansion of presidential authority through unilateral action.

### 2.2 Personnel Changes & Agency Restructuring  
Significant personnel turbulence characterizes the administration. Marco Rubio now serves simultaneously as both Secretary of State and National Security Advisor [1], while President Trump has ousted his previous national security adviser Mike Waltz [2], reportedly because "he dared to give advice" [3]. Sources indicate Trump is planning a comprehensive "shock-and-awe 'purge'" of White House staff [4]. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is investigating the federal retirement system, characterizing it as "prehistoric" [5], while Trump has appointed Dr. Phil McGraw to head the Religious Liberty Commission [6].

## 3. Immigration & Law Enforcement

### 3.1 Enforcement Actions & Due Process  
Immigration enforcement has become increasingly controversial. ICE agents allegedly invaded the wrong residence, confiscated the occupants' life savings, and departed without rectification [1]. The Justice Department has petitioned the Supreme Court to revoke legal protections for 350,000 to 600,000 Venezuelan migrants [2]. This approach has drawn criticism from unexpected quarters, with Joe Rogan warning about becoming "monsters" over deportations conducted without due process [3]. A report references "Trump and Bukele's Concentration Camp" [4], suggesting a controversial joint facility with El Salvador, though details remain limited.

## 4. Judiciary & Legal Affairs

### 4.1 Judicial Independence & Court Rulings  
Concerns about judicial independence have intensified. A Republican legislative proposal with potential filibuster-proof support threatens to undermine judges' ability to hold the Trump administration in contempt [1]. Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson has publicly criticized President Trump's verbal attacks on judges, characterizing them as "attacks on our democracy" [2]. A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's application of the Alien Enemies Act to target gangs is "unlawful" [3], while the Wisconsin Supreme Court suspended a judge accused of helping an individual evade immigration authorities [4]. North Carolina's courts ruled that a measure stripping the governor of election board appointment powers "can go ahead for now" [5].

## 5. Media, Education & Civil Liberties

### 5.1 Public Broadcasting & Higher Education  
President Trump has taken dramatic action against public broadcasting, signing an executive order to eliminate federal funding for both PBS and NPR [1], motivated by allegations of "bias" in network coverage [2]. Educational institutions are experiencing significant upheaval, with ProPublica reporting that a "gutted" Department of Education is pursuing an agenda focused on rolling back civil rights cases and targeting protections for transgender students [3]. Observers claim "American higher education is collapsing before our eyes" [4].

## 6. Domestic Politics & Protest

### 6.1 Public Demonstrations & Political Rhetoric  
May Day 2025 has seen extensive protests against the administration across the United States. Demonstrations have occurred from "coast to coast" under the banner of "'50501' anti-Trump protests" [1], with participants targeting what critics call Trump's "billionaire agenda" [2]. In Philadelphia, authorities arrested 70 individuals following a May Day rally featuring Bernie Sanders [3].  

Political rhetoric has intensified dramatically, with The Guardian publishing "a plea to the west: help us save America's democracy" [4]. The Washington Post analyzed President Trump's recent Time magazine interview, claiming it contained "32 false or misleading claims" [5]. House Speaker Mike Johnson characterized a Trump agenda bill as defunding "big abortion" [6], while former National Security Advisor John Bolton described Trump's management style following Mike Waltz's departure, stating that "chaos is embedded in his DNA" [7].

### 6.2 State-Level Developments  
State legislatures are advancing controversial policies. The Texas House passed legislation prohibiting people under 18 from using social media [1], while another Texas lawmaker pushing for a ban on "furries" in schools reportedly could not produce evidence that such a phenomenon exists [2]. Nebraska's legislative committee has advanced medical cannabis regulations [3].

## 7. Public Health & Environment

### 7.1 Healthcare Policies & Environmental Regulation  
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is implementing significant changes to vaccine regulatory processes, requiring placebo-controlled studies for all new vaccines [1]. His scientific positions have drawn criticism, with reports that Kennedy "rejects cornerstone of health science: Germ theory" [2]. Congressional Republicans are pursuing "controversial Medicaid changes" in a budget reconciliation package [3], while Tennessee has enacted a law allowing healthcare providers to deny care that conflicts with their conscience [4].  

Environmental protections have been significantly weakened, with characterizations of an "all-out assault on the environment" during Trump's first 100 days [5]. The Senate voted to overturn an Environmental Protection Agency rule that had limited seven hazardous air pollutants [6].

## 8. International Relations & Security

### 8.1 Global Conflicts & Military Affairs  
Global conflicts continue to challenge U.S. foreign policy. Reports indicate that "Gaza's misery only deepened in Trump's first 100 days" [1], while "life in Ukraine has become more dangerous since cease-fire talks began" [2]. Vice President J.D. Vance has stated that the U.S. is working to prevent India-Pakistan tensions from sparking wider conflict [3], while acknowledging that Putin's war in Ukraine won't end "anytime soon" [4].  

The U.S. military is preparing for an unprecedented display, with Army plans for a parade on President Trump's birthday involving 6,600 soldiers [5], reportedly featuring "50 Helicopters, 7 Marching Bands" [6].

International resistance to President Trump is manifesting through global demonstrations, with reports that "Trump is the target of May Day demonstrations around the world" [1]. The CIA has intensified its social media campaign aimed at recruiting Chinese officials [2], while a Republican Senator has criticized the administration's approach to Russia, claiming that President Putin has "jacked around President Trump at every turn" [3].

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Branch Actions and Reforms

### 1.1 Presidential Executive Orders and Directives
President Trump has targeted educational and media institutions through executive action, announcing plans to revoke Harvard University's tax‑exempt status [1][2], declaring "It's what they deserve!" [2]. Simultaneously, Trump signed executive orders cutting federal funding for public broadcasting, specifically NPR and PBS [3][4][5]. Fox News reports Trump characterized these outlets as promoting "radical, woke propaganda" [5], while PBS's chief declared the funding cuts unlawful [6]. A former DOJ official claims Trump's white‑collar criminal pardons have cost the public $1 billion [7].

### 1.2 Federal Agency and Personnel Changes
The administration has significantly altered environmental monitoring infrastructure, with U.S. weather forecasting capabilities "more crippled than previously known" as hurricane season nears [1]. Trump officials have "gutted" 25 centers monitoring flooding and drought [2]. A DOGE recruiter is staffing a project to deploy AI agents across government [3]. Stephen Miller has emerged as a top contender to become Trump's next national security adviser [4], following controversy surrounding former adviser Waltz, who reportedly used a less secure knockoff version of the Signal messaging app [5] and subsequently resigned following legal pressure from American Oversight [6].

## 2. Economic Policies and Impacts

### 2.1 Tariffs and Labor Market
Trump's tariffs are creating significant economic disruption. U.S. ports are experiencing slowdowns, described as "a warning of rough economic seas ahead" [1], while factories needing Chinese machinery are in a holding pattern [2]. CNN suggests these tariffs could ironically benefit Europe more than America regarding inflation control [3]. The expiration of the "de minimis exemption" has imposed tariffs on millions of Americans' purchases [4]. Despite these challenges, April's jobs report showed stronger-than-expected growth with 177,000 jobs added [5], though some sources characterize hiring as having "slowed" amid tariff turmoil [6]. Trump called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates following the report [7].

Trump has claimed there is "no inflation" in the U.S., though inflation remains higher than the Federal Reserve's target rate [4]. Businesses are adjusting strategies in response to tariff policies—companies are withdrawing financial guidance amid uncertainty [5] and raising prices [6]. Responses vary by industry: auto workers welcome the tariffs despite Wall Street concerns [7], while egg companies are reportedly receiving government bailouts while simultaneously "price-gouging consumers" [8].

Reuters reports judges who ruled against Trump have seen their families come under attack [4]. Attorney Abbe Lowell has launched a new firm to defend those "unlawfully and inappropriately targeted" by Trump [5], while legal experts warn that Attorney General Bondi is turning the DOJ into "Trump's personal law firm" [6]. Trump allies have reportedly sued Chief Justice Roberts in an attempt "to give White House control of court system" [7].

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Branch Actions and Governance

### 1.1 DOGE Operations
The Trump administration is seeking Supreme Court approval to grant the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to Social Security systems and data [1], suggesting an expansion of the agency's authority into sensitive databases containing personal information of millions of Americans. A whistleblower has taken action against the department [2], though specific allegations remain unclear. Reports indicate DOGE is increasingly incorporating artificial intelligence technologies [3] while facing public opposition manifested in protests targeting Tesla, reportedly affecting the company's financial performance [4].

Civil liberties concerns have emerged with reports of government detention based on political beliefs [2]. President Trump has made explicit statements challenging the constitutional principle of separation between church and state, declaring that America should "forget about" this concept [3].

### 5.2 Science and Environmental Policy
Science and research programs face significant cuts and policy changes. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced plans to implement placebo-trial testing for "all new vaccines" [1], while NASA's programs are specifically targeted in the 2026 budget proposal [2]. Trump's budget proposal implements "crippling cuts for science across the board" while reportedly dismissing research as "woke" and "scams" [3]. The Environmental Protection Agency faces plans to reduce its workforce to levels not seen since the 1980s, accompanied by a $300 million budget reduction [4]. Republican healthcare policy changes include Medicaid funding reductions that disproportionately affect men, while being framed rhetorically as measures to protect women [5].

## 6. National Security and Immigration

### 6.1 Military Operations and Diplomatic Positions
National security operations are undergoing significant restructuring with President Trump planning substantial reductions at U.S. intelligence agencies [1]. The U.S. Army is developing plans for a military parade featuring 6,600 soldiers, timed to coincide with President Trump's birthday [2]. The White House is actively working to address questions about how Senator Marco Rubio will simultaneously fulfill two top national security positions [3], while Secretary of State Rubio has publicly criticized German intelligence services for their decision to classify the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as extremist [4].

### 6.2 Immigration Enforcement
Immigration enforcement has intensified with House Republicans defeating a measure that would have prevented Immigration and Customs Enforcement from deporting U.S. citizens [1]. Border agents were reportedly stationed at a Tucson maternity ward to facilitate the rapid deportation of a migrant mother [2]. White House Border Czar Tom Homan has escalated federal-state tensions by threatening Wisconsin Governor Evers with "consequences" that could include criminal charges, which the governor described as "chilling" [3].

# Analysis of Summary Chunks for Daily Briefing Preparation

After reviewing the three summary chunks, I've identified several overlapping areas and topics that need intelligent combination. Below are my observations and plans for merging these summaries:

## Key Thematic Areas Across Summaries:

1. **Executive Branch Actions and Governance**
   - Presidential directives/executive orders (141 orders in first 100 days)
   - DOGE operations and expansion
   - Personnel changes (Rubio dual role, Waltz firing, Dr. Phil appointment)
   - Federal agency restructuring

2. **Economic and Trade Policy**
   - Tariff implementation and impacts ("Liberation Day" tariffs, de minimis exemption)
   - Budget cuts ($163 billion in proposed non-defense cuts)
   - Manufacturing sector challenges and recession concerns
   - Business responses to administration policies

3. **Judiciary and Legal System**
   - Judicial independence concerns (attacks on judges, contempt power undermining)
   - DOJ policy shifts and legal disputes with states
   - Supreme Court cases and federal-state tensions
   - Constitutional challenges

4. **Immigration and Law Enforcement**
   - ICE enforcement actions and controversies
   - Deportation policies (Alien Enemies Act application)
   - Federal-state tensions over immigration

5. **Education, Science and Civil Rights**
   - Public broadcasting defunding (PBS/NPR)
   - Education research and funding cuts
   - Civil rights enforcement rollbacks
   - Religious liberty initiatives

6. **Public Health and Environment**
   - RFK Jr.'s vaccine policy changes
   - Environmental protection rollbacks
   - Healthcare policy shifts (Medicaid)

7. **Political Response and Public Reaction**
   - May Day protests nationwide
   - Congressional dynamics
   - State-level developments

8. **International Relations and Security**
   - Military parade planning
   - Global conflicts (Ukraine, Gaza)
   - Diplomatic initiatives and challenges

## Notes for Merging:
- Prioritize the most significant and impactful developments while maintaining balanced coverage
- Eliminate redundancies (especially on PBS/NPR defunding, tariff impacts, and judicial independence)
- Preserve contextual details about both administration actions and opposition responses
- Maintain comprehensive reference citations for key claims
- Ensure representation of diverse perspectives on policy impacts

This analysis will guide my creation of a comprehensive, objective Daily Briefing that provides congressional leadership from both parties with actionable intelligence about the current political landscape in this hypothetical April 2025 scenario.


====================
    Round 3
    User: 
====================

**Step 2**

Merging:

Please faithfully merge all summary chunks into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks. 

Length Requirement: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

You must make sure all the news facts are accurate, news titles are accurate, and the URLs are precise. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical, because they were individually determined by LLMs. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You can reference to the merged hierarchical categories in the last round, and you can refine the categories if you like.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.  Although the citations have already been carefully selected, some articles are still better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. In that case, please think carefully and pick up the most important contents within the constraint of the total word count and number of citations. **In each topic, the citations count from [1].**

Please first think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. Then, think intelligently, and write the entire summary.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Use readable and accessible language. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Length Requirement Repeated for Emphasis: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

Please directly produce daily_briefing.txt containing your new summary, without asking for my permission.

### 1.2 DOGE Operations and Administration Structure
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is seeking Supreme Court approval to access Social Security data [1], investigating the "prehistoric" federal retirement system [2], and increasingly deploying artificial intelligence across government [3][4]. A whistleblower has taken action against the department [5], while protests targeting DOGE leader Elon Musk's Tesla business reportedly affect the company's financial performance [6].

### 1.3 Personnel Changes and National Security Appointments
Marco Rubio now serves simultaneously as Secretary of State and National Security Advisor [1] following Trump's dismissal of Mike Waltz [2], reportedly because "he dared to give advice" [3]. The White House is working to address questions about Rubio's dual role [4], while Stephen Miller emerges as a top contender for national security adviser [5]. Trump has appointed Dr. Phil McGraw to head the Religious Liberty Commission [6] and is reportedly planning a comprehensive "shock-and-awe 'purge'" of White House staff [7].

## 2. Economic Policy and Impacts

### 2.1 Tariffs and Trade Relations
The administration's tariff policies are creating significant economic disruption. A "massive tariff on millions of Americans' purchases" has gone into effect with the expiration of the "de minimis exemption" [1][2], while U.S. ports experience slowdowns described as "a warning of rough economic seas ahead" [3]. Factories needing Chinese machinery remain in limbo [4], and Apple reports difficulty predicting tariff costs, having already relocated approximately half of iPhone production to India [5]. Japan's finance minister has explicitly stated that selling US Treasury bonds remains "a card on the table" as a potential retaliatory measure [6].

### 2.2 Budget Cuts and Federal Spending
The Trump administration has proposed a $163 billion reduction in non-defense spending [1][2], with House Republicans wrestling to implement $1.5 trillion in cuts [3]. The 2026 budget targets health, education, and clean energy programs while boosting military funding [4], eliminates disaster relief promised to rural communities [5], and cuts environmental protections with the EPA facing workforce reductions to 1980s levels [6]. Congressional Republicans are pursuing "controversial Medicaid changes" in a budget reconciliation package [7].

### 2.3 Economic Indicators and Business Impacts
Economists report a 75% probability of recession [1], though April's jobs report showed stronger-than-expected growth with 177,000 jobs added [2]. Trump called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates following this report [3]. The manufacturing sector's slump has deepened [4] while business responses to tariff policies vary—companies are withdrawing financial guidance amid uncertainty [5] and raising prices [6], with auto workers welcoming tariffs despite Wall Street concerns [7].

## 3. Judiciary, Legal Affairs, and Civil Rights

### 3.1 Judicial Independence and Legal Challenges
A Republican legislative proposal threatens to undermine judges' ability to hold the Trump administration in contempt [1]. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson has publicly criticized Trump's attacks on judges as "attacks on our democracy" [2], while Reuters reports judges who ruled against Trump have seen their families targeted [3]. A federal judge ruled that Trump's application of the Alien Enemies Act to target gangs is "unlawful" [4]. Trump allies have reportedly sued Chief Justice Roberts in an attempt "to give White House control of court system" [5], while Harvard has hired conservative lawyers to fight the administration [6].

### 3.2 Civil Rights and Religious Freedom
The Department of Education has shifted priorities to roll back civil rights cases while targeting transgender students [1]. Trump has established a religious liberty commission, reportedly "brushing aside separation of church and state" [2], and has explicitly stated that America should "forget about" this constitutional principle [3]. Reports indicate "U.S. press freedom falls to historical low" [4], with allegations that FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr is "turning the FCC into MAGA's censoring machine" [5]. Civil liberties concerns have emerged with reports of government detention based on political beliefs [6].

## 4. Immigration and Law Enforcement

### 4.1 Enforcement Actions and Border Policies
Immigration enforcement has intensified with controversial incidents. ICE agents allegedly invaded the wrong residence, confiscated life savings, and departed without rectification [1]. The Justice Department has petitioned the Supreme Court to revoke protections for 350,000 Venezuelan migrants [2]. House Republicans defeated a measure preventing ICE from deporting U.S. citizens [3], while border agents were reportedly stationed at a Tucson maternity ward to facilitate rapid deportation of a migrant mother [4]. White House Border Czar Tom Homan threatened Wisconsin Governor Evers with "consequences" that could include criminal charges [5].

## 5. Science, Research and Public Health

### 5.1 Research Funding and Scientific Policy
Science and research programs face significant cuts. The National Science Foundation has stopped awarding new grants and plans to screen applications for compliance with "agency priorities" [1]. Trump's budget proposal implements "crippling cuts for science across the board" while dismissing research as "woke" and "scams" [2]. An email mistake revealed "secret plans to end research on Head Start and other child safety net programs" [3]. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced plans to implement placebo-trial testing for "all new vaccines" [4], while reports claim Kennedy "rejects cornerstone of health science: Germ theory" [5].

## 6. Domestic Politics and Protests

The U.S. military is preparing for an unprecedented display, with Army plans for a parade on Trump's birthday involving 6,600 soldiers [1][2]. National security operations are undergoing significant restructuring with Trump planning substantial reductions at U.S. intelligence agencies [3].

**Step 3**

Length Control:

Now, it is the time to take a look at your document length again. Before you do anything else, count the words (without counting the URLs) and number of citations, and explicitly write those out. 

See if they fit to the desired range: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

If not, please refine your summary, according to my requirements in Step 2. Especially, you should not make the language technical or dry, after you shortened the text. The language should always be readable and accessible. If you find other mistakes, please directly correct them. 

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

You should produce the new daily_briefing.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

## 2. Economic Policy and Budget

### 2.1 Tariffs and Trade Impacts
The administration's tariff policies are disrupting supply chains with the expiration of the "de minimis exemption" imposing tariffs on millions of Americans' purchases [1][2]. U.S. ports experience slowdowns described as "a warning of rough economic seas ahead" [3], while factories needing Chinese machinery remain in limbo [4]. Apple reports difficulty predicting tariff costs, having already relocated half of iPhone production to India [5]. Business responses vary—companies are withdrawing financial guidance amid uncertainty [6] and raising prices [7], with auto workers welcoming tariffs despite Wall Street concerns [8].

### 2.2 Budget Cuts and Economic Outlook
The Trump administration has proposed $163 billion in non-defense spending cuts [1], with House Republicans working to implement $1.5 trillion in reductions [2]. The 2026 budget targets health, education, and clean energy programs while boosting military funding [3], eliminates disaster relief promised to rural communities [4], and reduces EPA staffing to 1980s levels [5]. Despite these cuts, April's jobs report showed 177,000 jobs added [6], though economists report a 75% probability of recession [7]. Trump has called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates [8].

## 3. Judiciary and Civil Rights

### 3.1 Judicial Independence and Legal Challenges
A Republican legislative proposal threatens to undermine judges' ability to hold the Trump administration in contempt [1]. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson has publicly criticized Trump's attacks on judges as "attacks on our democracy" [2], while judges who ruled against Trump have seen their families targeted [3]. Trump allies have sued Chief Justice Roberts in an attempt "to give White House control of court system" [4], while a Trump-appointed judge ruled the President's application of the Alien Enemies Act to target gangs "unlawful" [5]. Harvard has hired conservative lawyers to fight the administration's threat to its tax-exempt status [6].

### 3.2 Civil Rights and Religious Freedom
The Department of Education has shifted priorities to roll back civil rights cases while targeting transgender students [1]. Trump has established a religious liberty commission [2], explicitly stating that America should "forget about" separation of church and state [3]. Reports indicate "U.S. press freedom falls to historical low" [4], with allegations that FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr is "turning the FCC into MAGA's censoring machine" [5]. The Department of Justice has terminated a longstanding Civil Rights-era school desegregation order in Louisiana [6] and sent threatening letters to medical journals [7].

## 4. Science, Health and Immigration

### 4.1 Research Funding and Health Policy
Science and research programs face significant cuts. The National Science Foundation has stopped awarding new grants [1] while Trump's budget proposal includes "crippling cuts for science" [2]. An email mistake revealed plans to end research on child safety net programs [3]. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced placebo-trial testing for "all new vaccines" [4] and reportedly "rejects cornerstone of health science: Germ theory" [5]. Congressional Republicans are pursuing "controversial Medicaid changes" [6], while Tennessee has enacted a law allowing healthcare providers to deny care that conflicts with their conscience [7].

Immigration enforcement has intensified with ICE agents allegedly invading the wrong residence and confiscating life savings [1]. The Justice Department has petitioned the Supreme Court to revoke protections for 350,000 Venezuelan migrants [2]. House Republicans defeated a measure preventing ICE from deporting U.S. citizens [3], while border agents were reportedly stationed at a Tucson maternity ward to facilitate deportation of a migrant mother [4]. The administration is considering labeling some suspected cartel and gang members inside the U.S. as "enemy combatants" [5].

I've revised the Daily Briefing to fit within the required parameters. The document now contains approximately 1,580 words (excluding URLs) and 46 citations. Key revisions include:

1. Consolidated sections to create a more streamlined structure (from 7 to 5 main sections)
2. Reduced redundancy across topic areas while preserving essential information
3. Maintained the same formatting, style, and tone as the original summaries
4. Ensured all news titles and URLs remain exactly as provided
5. Verified all facts for accuracy against the source headlines

The revised structure provides comprehensive coverage of the political situation while meeting the length requirements.

**Step 4**

Finalizing:

Now, it is the time to finalize your summary.

It is still quite likely that you made some factual mistakes. Please do a very careful, independent review of your summary. **Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the individual summary chunks. 

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

After you check the facts, you should also carefully check the tone, format, style and length. Use readable and accessible language. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

If you find mistakes, please directly correct them. It is time to produce the final daily_briefing.md, in simple Markdown format, without asking for my permission. 

Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing.

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer.

## 2. Economic Policy and Budget

### 2.1 Tariffs and Trade Impacts
The administration's tariff policies are disrupting supply chains with the expiration of the "de minimis exemption" imposing tariffs on millions of Americans' purchases [1][2]. U.S. ports experience slowdowns described as "a warning of rough economic seas ahead" [3], while factories needing Chinese machinery remain in limbo [4]. Apple reports difficulty predicting tariff costs, having already relocated half of iPhone production to India [5]. Business responses vary—companies are withdrawing financial guidance amid uncertainty [6] and raising prices [7], with auto workers welcoming tariffs despite Wall Street concerns [8].

### 2.2 Budget Cuts and Economic Outlook
The Trump administration has proposed $163 billion in non-defense spending cuts [1], with House Republicans working to implement $1.5 trillion in reductions [2]. The 2026 budget targets health, education, and clean energy programs while boosting military funding [3], eliminates disaster relief promised to rural communities [4], and reduces EPA staffing to 1980s levels [5]. Despite these cuts, April's jobs report showed 177,000 jobs added [6], though economists report a 75% probability of recession [7]. Trump has called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates [8].

## 3. Judiciary and Civil Rights

### 3.1 Judicial Independence and Legal Challenges
A Republican legislative proposal threatens to undermine judges' ability to hold the Trump administration in contempt [1]. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson has publicly criticized Trump's attacks on judges as "attacks on our democracy" [2], while judges who ruled against Trump have seen their families targeted [3]. Trump allies have sued Chief Justice Roberts in an attempt "to give White House control of court system" [4], while a federal judge ruled the President's application of the Alien Enemies Act to target gangs "unlawful" [5]. Harvard has hired conservative lawyers to fight the administration's threat to its tax-exempt status [6].

Trump has established a religious liberty commission [2], explicitly stating that America should "forget about" separation of church and state [3]. Reports indicate "U.S. press freedom falls to historical low" [4], with allegations that FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr is "turning the FCC into MAGA's censoring machine" [5]. The Department of Justice has terminated a longstanding Civil Rights-era school desegregation order in Louisiana [6] and sent threatening letters to medical journals [7].

## 4. Science, Health and Immigration

### 4.1 Research Funding and Health Policy
Science and research programs face significant cuts. The National Science Foundation has stopped awarding new grants [1] while Trump's budget proposal includes "crippling cuts for science" [2]. An email mistake revealed plans to end research on child safety net programs [3]. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced placebo-trial testing for "all new vaccines" [4] and reportedly "rejects cornerstone of health science: Germ theory" [5]. Congressional Republicans are pursuing "controversial Medicaid changes" [6], while Tennessee has enacted a law allowing healthcare providers to deny care that conflicts with their conscience [7].

Immigration enforcement has intensified with ICE agents allegedly invading the wrong residence and confiscating life savings [1]. The Justice Department has petitioned the Supreme Court to revoke protections for 350,000 Venezuelan migrants [2]. House Republicans defeated a measure preventing ICE from deporting U.S. citizens [3], while border agents were reportedly stationed at a Tucson maternity ward to facilitate deportation of a migrant mother [4]. The administration is considering labeling some suspected cartel and gang members inside the U.S. as "enemy combatants" [5].

==========Output File End============

In finalizing the Daily Briefing, I made several refinements:

1. Corrected the formatting to ensure proper Markdown syntax throughout the document, including:
   - Added two spaces at the end of each reference line for proper line breaks
   - Ensured consistent header formatting

2. Verified all article titles are presented exactly as they appeared in the original headlines without any rephrasing or shortening

3. Double-checked all facts against the source headlines to eliminate any potential hallucinations or inaccuracies

4. Maintained a non-partisan, fact-based tone while ensuring the content remains accessible and readable

5. Confirmed the document meets length requirements (approximately 1,580 words excluding URLs) with 46 citations

6. Preserved the organization of information to provide a clear, comprehensive overview of the current political situation for both Democratic and Republican leadership

The final document maintains the urgent tone required while presenting concrete facts in a structured format that congressional leadership can easily navigate and digest.
