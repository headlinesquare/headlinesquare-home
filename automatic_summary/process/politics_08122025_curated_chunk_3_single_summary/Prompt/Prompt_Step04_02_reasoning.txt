**First Check After Step 4**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes and produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.
