    Round 1
    User: 
====================

**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/politics.**

The r/politics subreddit on Reddit is a community focused on discussing and sharing news, analysis, and commentary related to U.S. politics. It's primarily a hub for:
Breaking political news
Opinion pieces and editorials
Legislation and policy discussions
Elections, political figures, and government actions

It's moderated to focus on U.S.-centric content and generally avoids memes or low-effort posts. The subreddit can have a progressive or liberal-leaning tone, depending on the community's engagement, though it hosts a range of political perspectives.

====================Input File End======================

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the JSONL lines for the Reddit news feed from r/politics. Once you provide them, I'll begin the process of creating a comprehensive Daily Briefing by first defining appropriate categories for the news (Step 1).

I understand the context is May 2025, with President Trump (47th President) and Elon Musk (Head of DOGE) expanding executive power. I'll analyze these news items objectively to create a briefing useful for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.

Please provide the JSONL lines, and I'll begin the analysis.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

**Revisions Made:**
I refined the original 6 areas into 7 areas to better reflect the actual news content. The categories now more precisely match the headlines in the feed, with clearer distinctions between executive actions, domestic policy, and constitutional challenges. I've also created more specific topics that directly align with recurring themes in the headlines, such as birthright citizenship litigation, DOGE actions, and the Qatar plane gift controversy (under Ethics and Conflicts of Interest). The structure now provides a more intuitive organizational framework for the specific news stories being analyzed.


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

------------------------------------------------------------

Each article has been uniquely assigned to one of the seven areas and its corresponding topic based on its content.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 5
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the new file “step2_categorized.txt.” I have gone through each record (IDs 79 to 156) and verified that every article appears exactly once in the correct hierarchy. I also spotted that one article (ID 118) had been omitted from the Ethics category in Area 1 and have now placed it in the proper order. The file is organized by Area and then by Topic (using our two-tier hierarchy), with the JSON lines listed in ascending order by their IDs under the appropriate topic.

Revisions Made:
1. I re-read the complete list of articles (IDs 79–156) and ensured each record was uniquely assigned to one area/topic.
2. I grouped the articles hierarchically by Area and then by Topic, listing the JSON lines underneath.
3. I corrected an oversight where article ID 118 was missing from Topic 1.4 and inserted it in ascending order.
4. I confirmed that no record was omitted or duplicated and that all topics under each Area follow our two-tier hierarchy.

This concludes the “step2_categorized.txt” file.


====================
    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the updated “step2_categorized.txt” file after a second independent review. I have re-checked that all 78 articles (IDs 79–156) are covered exactly once, and within each topic the articles now appear in strict ascending order by their IDs. No categorization reassignments were needed, but I did make minor reordering adjustments in a few topics to ensure proper ascending order.

Revisions Made:
1. I verified that every article from ID 79 to 156 appears exactly once (totaling 78 records).
2. I re-sorted the articles within each topic into strict ascending order by their ID.
3. No changes to the area/topic assignments were necessary beyond these ordering adjustments.

This updated “step2_categorized.txt” file now reflects a complete, uniquely assigned, and properly ordered hierarchy based on our categorization.

    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!

    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete “step3.txt” file. In this file I have assigned an importance score (from 1 to 10) for every news article, then for each topic (based on the weighted contribution of its articles plus its thematic significance), and finally for each area. I worked carefully across all items, inserting a new key "importance" into each JSON line (immediately after "title") without touching any other fields. The scores were determined by considering source reputation, title clarity/relevance, and the overall policy or political importance of the subject—using the scale cautiously (with “10” reserved only for the very top).

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised “step3.txt” file. After a careful re‐evaluation, I made two changes:
1. For Article ID 139 (“Trump’s funding cuts are unofficially halting government operations” from washingtonpost.com), I bumped its importance from 8 to 9 because its implications for government operations are especially consequential.
2. For Article ID 143 (“US Customs and Border Protection Plans to Photograph Everyone Exiting the US by Car…” from wired.com), I reduced its importance from 8 to 7, as the issue—while significant—is less immediately critical. Consequently, the overall topic “Immigration and Border Security” in Area 5 has been adjusted from an importance of 8 down to 7 to reflect its articles’ average weights more consistently.

This completes the sorting of areas, topics, and news articles by descending importance while preserving original order in cases of ties.


====================
    Round 10
    User: 
====================

**First Check After Step 4**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes and produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 10
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the new “step4.txt” file after a careful re‐evaluation. In reviewing the sorting work, I verified that:

• The seven Areas are sorted descending by their importance (with ties preserving the original order of areas).  
• Within each Area, the Topics are sorted descending by importance (with topics of identical importance kept in their original order from Step 3).  
• Within each Topic, the Articles are sorted descending by their “importance” value while preserving the original order among those with the same score.

I did find one minor adjustment in Topic 1.4: while all articles with importance 8 were already present, I confirmed that their relative order is now explicitly maintained (106, 110, 118, 128, 136, 141) before articles with lower scores (first importance 7, then 6). No substantive changes were necessary beyond confirming all tie-break orders are correctly preserved.

Revision Summary:
– In Topic 1.4, I confirmed that all articles with an importance score of 8 are now placed first in their original sequence (106, 110, 118, 128, 136, 141), followed by the article with score 7 (148) and then those with score 6 (123, 135).  
– I rechecked all Areas and Topics to ensure descending order by importance with ties preserved as in the original order, and no other changes were needed.

This revised "step4.txt" fully meets the sorting requirements.

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 11
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the new step4.txt file with updated ascending numbering for Areas and Topics. All records have been reviewed, and each article is uniquely and exhaustively included. The only change from the previous version is that the Area and Topic headings have been renumbered in ascending order according to their order of appearance.

Revision Summary:
– All articles and topics have been rechecked to ensure every record is uniquely and exhaustively included.
– The numbering of Areas and Topics has been entirely reassigned in ascending order based on their order of appearance. For example, in Area 1 the topics now read as Topic 1.1 (originally “1.4”), Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3, and Topic 1.4 (originally “1.1”), while preserving the order and content of articles.
– Similar renumbering was applied to Area 2 and Area 6, where previous numbering was non-sequential.
– No other content or sorting order has been altered.

This revised step4.txt meets all the requirements.


====================
    Round 12
    User: 
====================

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

## Area 1: Executive Power and Federal Governance (importance: 9)

### Topic 1.1: Ethics and Conflicts of Interest (importance: 9)
Multiple major news outlets report that the Trump administration plans to accept a luxury jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One (106, 118, 128, 136, 141). While official U.S. government sources confirmed this arrangement, Qatar subsequently called these reports "inaccurate" (148), creating uncertainty about the transaction's status. Critics have characterized the potential acceptance as "comically corrupt" (123), and at least one report suggests Presidential advisor Pam Bondi is involved in facilitating the arrangement (135). Separately, a House Committee has launched an investigation into allegations that a politically connected startup received preferential treatment from a federal agency (110), highlighting broader concerns about conflicts of interest within the administration.

### Topic 1.2: Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Actions (importance: 8)
DOGE and RFK Jr. have dismantled legally required offices within federal agencies, actions that now face potential judicial reversal (131). The Department, headed by Elon Musk, has overseen significant deregulation that appears to directly benefit Musk's business interests, as his regulatory challenges from previous administrations are reportedly "melting away" (130, 142). A New York Times analysis suggests Musk is encountering significant resistance to his government reform efforts (84), indicating tension between DOGE's ambitious restructuring goals and institutional constraints.

### Topic 1.3: Federal Agency Policy Changes (importance: 8)
Agency operations across the federal government face significant disruption due to Trump administration funding cuts (139). FEMA has reduced emergency training programs despite the approaching hurricane season (79), raising concerns about disaster preparedness. Democratic senators are pressuring the administration over endangered species protections (121), suggesting environmental policy rollbacks.

Former Harris campaign advisors have criticized the lack of a coherent plan behind the tariffs (81).

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Senator John Barrasso has stated he doesn't believe a suggested suspension of habeas corpus will "come to Congress" [51], indicating there may be internal Republican resistance to the most extreme measures.

## POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND DISCOURSE

Democrats are engaged in internal reflection and strategic planning. Senator Amy Klobuchar has suggested the party "would have been better served by a primary" in 2024 [52], indicating dissatisfaction with candidate selection processes. Representative Jasmine Crockett has commented that Democrats want "the safest white boy" for the 2028 ticket with a specific candidate in mind [53]. CNN reports that while Trump made "historic gains with minority voters in 2024," these demographic groups are "already pulling back in 2025" [54], suggesting early volatility in political alignments. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has warned of serious consequences if Democrats are arrested for participating in an ICE protest [55], indicating escalating tensions around immigration enforcement opposition.

# step6.txt

# DAILY BRIEFING: MAY 2025

## EXECUTIVE POWER AND FEDERAL GOVERNANCE

### Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Multiple major news outlets report that the Trump administration plans to accept a luxury jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One [1][2]. Qatar has subsequently called these reports "inaccurate" [3], creating uncertainty about the transaction's status. Critics have characterized the potential acceptance as "comically corrupt" [4]. Separately, a House Committee has launched an investigation into allegations that a politically connected startup received preferential treatment from a federal agency [5].

### Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Actions
DOGE and RFK Jr. have gutted legally required offices within federal agencies, actions that now face potential judicial reversal [6]. Elon Musk, who heads DOGE, appears to be benefiting as his "regulatory troubles have begun to melt away" [7]. A New York Times analysis suggests Musk is encountering significant resistance to his government reform efforts [8].

### Federal Agency Policy Changes
Agency operations across the federal government face significant disruption due to Trump administration funding cuts [9]. FEMA has reduced emergency training programs despite the approaching hurricane season [10], raising concerns about disaster preparedness. Democratic senators are pressuring the administration over endangered species protections [11], and the administration fired the Copyright Office head shortly after a report questioned whether AI training constitutes fair use [12].

## ECONOMIC AND TRADE POLICY

### U.S.-China Trade Relations
U.S. and Chinese officials have concluded trade negotiations with reported "substantial progress" [13]. Talks led to an agreement to reduce the trade deficit [14], with President Trump characterizing the outcome as a "total reset" in U.S.-China economic relations [15]. Specific details are expected on Monday [14], though the exact terms remain unclear.

### Federal Budget and Tariff Policies
The Republican tax plan currently under consideration would cost an estimated $5 trillion according to a recent analysis [16], raising significant concerns about fiscal sustainability. President Trump's tariff policy faces criticism from various sectors. Citadel CEO Ken Griffin warned that the tariffs create conditions for "crony capitalism" [17], while Lutnick indicated the 10% baseline tariff will remain for the "foreseeable future" [18]. Small businesses are reporting severe difficulties adapting to the new tariff regime [19], with sources quoted saying "nobody in power seems to care."

## FOREIGN POLICY AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS

### Russia-Ukraine Conflict
President Trump has demanded Ukraine hold direct talks with Russia, prompting Ukrainian President Zelensky to offer a meeting with Russian President Putin [20]. Senator Marco Rubio is planning to visit Turkey to advance renewed Russia-Ukraine peace talks potentially hosted in Istanbul [21]. However, U.S. and European leaders have rejected Russia's proposal for negotiations without a ceasefire first [22], creating tension between the administration's approach and that of traditional allies.

### Middle East Diplomacy and Security
President Trump is scheduled to visit Middle Eastern Gulf allies with a focus on trade and investment opportunities rather than traditional security concerns [23]. Notably, the trip to Saudi Arabia raises the prospect of U.S. nuclear cooperation with the kingdom [24], signaling a potential major shift in nuclear proliferation policy. Separately, Hamas has agreed to release a U.S.-Israeli hostage, Edan Alexander, as part of broader ceasefire negotiations [25].

### International Relations and Regional Conflicts
The United Nations is reportedly "losing favor" with the United States [26], suggesting a shift in U.S. engagement with multilateral institutions. Tensions between India and Pakistan appear to be stabilizing, with reports that a ceasefire is holding despite accusations of violations from both sides [27]. The Indian air force has acknowledged combat losses but stated that "all pilots [are] back home" [28], suggesting de-escalation.

## HEALTHCARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES

Democratic lawmakers have raised alarms about Republican efforts to cut Medicaid funding, with some warning that "children will die" as a result of these reductions [29]. Dr. Mehmet Oz faced criticism for suggesting Americans have a "patriotic duty" to stay healthy, with critics connecting this to Medicare cuts [30]. President Trump is reportedly planning to sign an executive order aimed at reducing prescription drug prices [31], though no details about implementation are available. The administration has also halted funding for research on infants with heart defects [32], representing a specific cut to medical research programs.

## CIVIL RIGHTS AND IDENTITY ISSUES

### Immigration and Border Security
The Trump administration has implemented a refugee program specifically for white South Africans, with Reuters reporting the first participants boarding planes to the United States [33]. U.S. Customs and Border Protection is expanding surveillance technology, planning to photograph all individuals exiting the U.S. by car using real-time face recognition systems [34]. Representative Matt Gaetz visited El Salvador's controversial mega-prison facility and subsequently presented it to Stephen Miller [35], suggesting possible interest in adapting such models for U.S. use.

### LGBTQ+ Policies and Diversity Initiatives
The Department of Health and Human Services has deleted a mental health report specifically focused on transgender children in Utah [36], indicating a shift in federal health policy. An AP-NORC poll suggests transgender issues are a political "strength for Trump" [37]. The Pentagon has issued directives to remove books addressing diversity, anti-racism, and gender issues from military libraries [38] and has expanded this effort with an order to review all library books [39].

## LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES

### Birthright Citizenship and Executive Authority
The Supreme Court is hearing arguments on birthright citizenship in a case that reportedly tests the Court's willingness to constrain executive actions by the Trump administration [40]. Pregnant mothers potentially affected by changes to birthright citizenship policies are watching these proceedings with significant concern [41].

### State Lawsuits and Civil Liberties Concerns
Multiple states have initiated legal challenges against Trump administration policies. A Wall Street Journal report indicates an "obscure New York court" will rule on the legality of Trump's tariff policies [42]. Additionally, states have sued the administration over what they characterize as a "'fake' energy emergency" declared in an executive order [43]. Time magazine has published an analysis of habeas corpus and how it is "under threat by the Trump administration" [44], suggesting concerns about fundamental constitutional protections. Senator John Barrasso has stated he doesn't believe a suggested suspension of habeas corpus will "come to Congress" [45].

## POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND DISCOURSE

Democrats are engaged in internal reflection and strategic planning. Senator Amy Klobuchar has suggested the party "would have been better served by a primary" in 2024 [46], indicating dissatisfaction with candidate selection processes. Representative Jasmine Crockett has commented that Democrats want "the safest white boy" for the 2028 ticket with a specific candidate in mind [47]. CNN reports that while Trump made "historic gains with minority voters in 2024," these demographic groups are "already pulling back in 2025" [48], suggesting early volatility in political alignments.

====================

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has warned of serious consequences if Democrats are arrested for participating in an ICE protest [4], indicating escalating tensions around immigration enforcement opposition.

Revisions made:
1. Corrected the citation numbering system to restart at [1] for each topic/subtopic as required in the instructions
2. Reorganized the references section to group citations by topic/subtopic for easier reference
3. Added section headers in the references to match the main document structure
4. Maintained the same content but with proper citation numbering
5. Preserved the word count (approximately 1,598 words excluding references and title)
6. Ensured all original titles remain exactly as they appeared in the source
7. Verified all facts against the original headlines to prevent hallucinations
8. Double-checked the formatting to include "\n\n" between reference entries


====================
    Round 17
    User: 
====================

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

## HEALTHCARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES

Democratic lawmakers have raised alarms about Republican efforts to cut Medicaid funding, with some warning that "children will die" as a result of these reductions [1]. Dr. Mehmet Oz faced criticism for suggesting Americans have a "patriotic duty" to stay healthy, with critics connecting this to Medicare cuts [2].

Representative Jasmine Crockett has commented that Democrats want "the safest white boy" for the 2028 ticket with a specific candidate in mind [2].

Explanation of Revisions:
1. Each citation entry has been reformatted to strictly follow the "[number] TITLE, URL" format with a comma separating the title and URL, and a double newline between entries.
2. I rechecked every reference to ensure that both the title and the URL match exactly the originals from the provided JSON record.
3. All section reference lists now appear immediately after their relevant summary text with no extraneous formatting.

This completes the updated step7.txt file.

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!

## 7. Political Opposition and Discourse

Democrats are engaged in internal reflection and strategic planning. Senator Amy Klobuchar has suggested the party "would have been better served by a primary" in 2024 [1], indicating dissatisfaction with candidate selection processes. Representative Jasmine Crockett has commented that Democrats want "the safest white boy" for the 2028 ticket with a specific candidate in mind [2]. CNN reports that while Trump made "historic gains with minority voters in 2024," these demographic groups are "already pulling back in 2025" [3], suggesting early volatility in political alignments. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has warned of serious consequences if Democrats are arrested for participating in an ICE protest [4], indicating escalating tensions around immigration enforcement opposition.
