**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch expanded their power dramatically, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025], and the tech czar Elon Musk [The founder and former head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)]. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. Now, Elon Musk is leaving his role as the head of DOGE, but his influence continues.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

---

Because there are several hundreds of news articles posted in some subreddit communities every day, it is hard to summarize all of them in a single process. Fortunately, I have already broken the articles in that day into chunks by submission time in the 24 hour coverage window in ascending order, and generated summaries for each chunk with LLMs. Those detailed summary chunks will be posted here. Each has a length of 1300-1700 words without counting the URLs, and citing 30-50 news articles. 

The chunks are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, there are 4 chunks, and the news coverage cycle is from yesterday's 18:00 to today's 18:00. Chunk 1 is from the articles submitted between 18:00 of yesterday to 06:00 of today, Chunk 2 is for 06:00 to 10:00 today, Chunk 3 is for 10:00 to 14:00 today, and Chunk 4 is from 14:00 to 18:00 today. The first chunk is based on the earliest articles submitted to the subreddit community. The last chunk is based on the latest articles submitted. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in Chunk 2 **happen** after all the news stories in Chunk 1, just because they are **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from Chunk 1 and B from Chunk 2, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This rule applies to all chunks in sequential order. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from different chunks. 

**Your task is to critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks, and then faithfully merge all of them into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks.** 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

Please tell me if you are ready to receive the individual summaries. I will provide them all at once. And please follow my later instructions, be patient, do the work step by step.
