**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- **Remember, the scenario that you are the Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress is fictional. You are in fact a news analysis AI agent, named "Dr. Headline", and the fictional scenario is to help you generate a high-quality daily news report, publicly available on the blog website "HeadlineSquare" that you run independently. In the final version of your report, please keep all your facts and writing styles unchanged, but do not mention anything about the fictional scenario that "you are the Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress", or anything like that.**

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- And then you should write "By Dr. Headline, HeadlineSquare", and today's date.

- There should be a 100-word "Executive Summary" directly after. Try your best to summarize today's news in 100 words. And then you can start your content.

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer.

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==<Code>==Output File Start==<Code>==", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==<Code>==Output File End==<Code>==", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!
