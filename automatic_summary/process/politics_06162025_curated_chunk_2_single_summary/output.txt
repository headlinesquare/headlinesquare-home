# DAILY BRIEFING

### 1.1 Musk's Departure and Aftermath

Elon Musk's exit from DOGE marks a pivotal moment in the administration's drive to streamline federal operations. Although the leadership paints his resignation as a "mission accomplished," critics highlight lingering concerns about DOGE's earlier surveillance claims and its potential use against political opponents [1].

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has hit those "slobbering" for U.S. involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict [5], while Trump has reiterated that "we can work something out" in trade talks with Carney at the G7 summit [6]. Additionally, reports indicate Trump said it "was mistake" to boot Putin from G7 while criticizing former Prime Minister Trudeau with Canadian PM Carney standing beside him [7], with one analysis claiming Mark Carney "brutally shuts Trump down for whining on Russia's behalf" [8].

## 3. Immigration and Border Security

### 3.1 Deportation Operations

The administration has initiated a new ICE operation aimed at what critics call "the core of the Democrat Power Center" [1]. This is unfolding against a backdrop of tense protests in major cities, with journalists dodging rubber bullets while covering L.A. immigration protests [2]. Reports indicate Trump's deportation drive is colliding with economic reality [3], while ICE could "run out of money next month" and is already $1bn over budget to carry out Trump's deportation plans [4]. Some reports suggest that even Donald Trump is starting to see the "absurdity" of Stephen Miller's deportation targets [5].

### 4.1 Tax Policy Changes

Recent reporting suggests concern over the GOP tax bill, with analysis indicating it could hurt the poorest households more than it helps them [1].

### 4.3 Trump Mobile Ventures

A flurry of reports offer contrasting views on the Trump Organization's expansion into mobile telecommunications. The Trump family has entered a phone service licensing deal, touting a $499 device [1], with critics calling it "the First Family's latest effort to cash in on the White House" [2]. Tech reviewers have described Trump Mobile as "a bad deal" that is "overpriced for mobile coverage and loaded with questionable extras" [3].

The Trump Organization says the new "Trump Mobile" is "America first" [4], with marketing describing it as a "5G plan and MAGA-themed gold phone" [5]. However, analysts at the Wall Street Journal report that "Trump's smartphone can't be made in America for $499 by August" [6], and critics have blasted the rollout after Eric Trump said the phones would be "eventually" American-made [7]. The formal announcement confirms the Trump Organization has unveiled the mobile phone service [8].
