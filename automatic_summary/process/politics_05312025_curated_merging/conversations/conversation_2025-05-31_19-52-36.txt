**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch expanded their power dramatically, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025], and the tech czar Elon Musk [The founder and former head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)]. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. Now, Elon Musk is leaving his role as the head of DOGE, but his influence continues.

The U.S. general election on November 5, 2024, resulted in significant shifts in both the presidency and control of Congress. 

In the presidential contest, Republican former President Donald Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, securing 312 electoral votes to Harris’s 226 by passing the 270 vote threshold comfortably. Trump also won a plurality of the popular vote with approximately 77.3 million ballots (49.8%) compared to Harris’s 75.0 million (48.3%). Voter turnout was 64.1% of eligible voters, marking one of the highest participations in recent U.S. elections. Trump’s victory extended across all seven key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, underscoring the geographic breadth of his support. 

In the legislative elections, Republicans regained control of the U.S. Senate by flipping key seats in West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, yielding a 53–47 majority to facilitate the incoming Trump administration’s agenda. Meanwhile, the GOP maintained a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, entering the 119th Congress with a 220–215 margin.

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

---

Because there are several hundreds of news articles posted in some subreddit communities every day, it is hard to summarize all of them in a single process. Fortunately, I have already broken the articles in that day into chunks by submission time in the 24 hour coverage window in ascending order, and generated summaries for each chunk with LLMs. Those detailed summary chunks will be posted here. Each has a length of 1300-1700 words without counting the URLs, and citing 30-50 news articles. 

The chunks are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, there are 4 chunks, and the news coverage cycle is from yesterday's 18:00 to today's 18:00. Chunk 1 is from the articles submitted between 18:00 of yesterday to 06:00 of today, Chunk 2 is for 06:00 to 10:00 today, Chunk 3 is for 10:00 to 14:00 today, and Chunk 4 is from 14:00 to 18:00 today. The first chunk is based on the earliest articles submitted to the subreddit community. The last chunk is based on the latest articles submitted. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in Chunk 2 **happen** after all the news stories in Chunk 1, just because they are **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from Chunk 1 and B from Chunk 2, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This rule applies to all chunks in sequential order. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from different chunks. 

**Your task is to critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks, and then faithfully merge all of them into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks.** 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


**A very important rule is that factual accuracy is the utmost important issue. Please be aware that your internal knowledge is outdated, and you do not have Internet access right now.** You need to generate a report entirely based on the information provided in today's Reddit news headlines. Sometimes, a news headline may not give you enougn details to correctly interpret it. In this case, please do not make any speculation, and please report the unclear news headline exactly as it is, in quotes, and then remind the readers to check the source for details. 

That also applies to the titles and positions of political figures. Your internal knowledge is outdated. If the news headlines do not provide enough knowledge about the current title and position of a particular political figure, please do not add any title and position to that person, simply relying on your old knowledge. In this situation, if it doesn't feel critical, please skip the title and position, and directly use the full name of the person. If it does feel critical to mention the title and position of the person, please rely on the list of political figures as I provided earlier, but be aware that even that list may be a month behind reality. **Remember, when unsure, it is better to be vague than outright wrong.**

---

Please tell me if you are ready to receive the individual summaries. I will provide them all at once. And please follow my later instructions, be patient, do the work step by step.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I'm ready to receive the individual summaries. Please provide them, and I'll carefully analyze and merge them into a comprehensive Daily Briefing that would be useful for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress. I understand the importance of factual accuracy and will rely solely on the information provided rather than my internal knowledge.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1**

Comparing:

Please critically analyze the similarities and differences of those summary chunks provided below. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You must use your limited length to summarize the most important news, while skipping the secondary.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.

Please carefully think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. **You will do the merging task in the next round with my detailed instructions. Please do not attempt to write down your summary at this step, because you haven't been given the full instructions yet!** It is always better to take some time to think clearly for such a difficult task, and make detailed plans for yourself, before taking any actions. You should use this opportunity to prepare yourself for your next round of work by writing down some notes for yourself.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Branch and Governance

### 1.1 DOGE and Government Efficiency

Mixed signals surround Elon Musk's status at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). While reports indicate Musk is leaving, President Trump has contradicted this, stating Musk is "not really leaving" [1]. A federal judge has approved Treasury DOGE team's access to sensitive data systems [2], expanding the department's reach. Despite Musk's claims of "chainsawing government spending," analysis suggests the impact has been modest, "more like a trim" [3]. The White House has refused to address questions about drug testing for the DOGE chief [4].

### 1.2 White House Operations and Presidential Actions

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is considering ways to revamp Trump's intelligence briefings, potentially reformatting them as video presentations resembling Fox News broadcasts. Reports indicate Trump has been taking these briefings less frequently than his predecessors [1]. President Trump recently fired the Director of the National Portrait Gallery, citing issues related to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives [2]. When asked about former President Biden's cancer diagnosis, Trump expressed that he doesn't "feel sorry" for Biden, describing him as "vicious" [3].

### 1.3 Federal Workforce Restructuring

The Trump administration's efforts to reshape the federal workforce face judicial challenges. New hiring guidelines require federal job applicants to write essays demonstrating how they would advance Trump's policy priorities, focusing on hiring "patriotic Americans" [1]. An appeals court has maintained a block on the administration's attempts to downsize the federal workforce [2], creating obstacles to the administration's bureaucratic reform agenda.

## 2. Foreign Policy and National Security

### 2.1 Defense and Military Affairs

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has taken a firm stance on China's military activities, characterizing them as an "imminent" threat during a security conference in Singapore. Hegseth stated that China's army "is rehearsing for the real deal" and affirmed U.S. commitment to Indo-Pacific allies [1]. He has also called on Asian allies to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, matching levels he indicated are being reached in Europe [2].

### 2.2 International Relations and Diplomacy

The Trump administration's approach to the Russia-Ukraine conflict shows a complex mix of pressure and accommodation. A Trump envoy announced that the United Kingdom will join the United States at upcoming peace talks, with messaging directed at Putin to "take the deal" [1]. In what appears to be a conciliatory stance, a Trump envoy has stated that Russia's concerns about NATO expansion are "fair" [2]. The administration faces accusations of hypocrisy after claiming that the UK and Europe are "trampling democracy" [3].

### 2.3 Security Threats

National security officials are raising alarms about emerging threats. A U.S. general has warned that a terrorist group based in Africa has developed capabilities that could enable attacks within the United States [1]. Separately, one of President Trump's closest advisors has been impersonated after their phone was hacked [2], highlighting vulnerabilities in high-level communications.

## 3. Economic Policy

### 3.1 Tariffs and International Trade

President Trump's trade policies are expanding but facing legal challenges. New executive orders could effectively end Chinese drone sales in the United States [1]. Trump has implemented 50% tariffs on steel while celebrating what he described as a "blockbuster" deal with Japan [2]. However, the administration's tariff policies have encountered legal obstacles, with conflicting court rulings creating uncertainty [3]. The President has responded forcefully to adverse legal decisions regarding his tariff authority [4].

### 3.2 Budget and Fiscal Policy

The Trump administration's fiscal policies are drawing scrutiny. Wall Street entities have warned administration officials that the Republican tax legislation could potentially disrupt bond markets [1]. The White House has released a partial budget document that omits important details [2]. Budget cuts proposed by the administration reportedly threaten funding for safety training programs in high-risk occupations [3].

### 4.3 Border Security and Law Enforcement

The Trump administration's approach to identifying "sanctuary jurisdictions" contains apparent inconsistencies, with the official list including some localities that actually support the President's immigration policies [1]. The FBI is investigating attempts to impersonate one of President Trump's senior advisers [2], while FBI Director Kash Patel has stated that bureau resources have been diverted to investigate "copycat" incidents related to a post referencing "Comey '86 47'" [3].

## 5. Healthcare and Social Welfare

### 5.1 Healthcare Initiatives

The Trump administration has terminated a program described as critical to the search for an HIV vaccine [1]. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) report has come under scrutiny after it was found to contain references to nonexistent studies [2]. The White House has acknowledged these problems and indicated that the report will be updated [3].

### 5.2 Public Health and Social Programs

A new COVID subvariant is spreading rapidly as the Trump administration shifts away from vaccine-focused strategies [1]. Republicans and Democrats are clashing over Medicaid changes in what Republicans term Trump's "big, beautiful bill." Democrats claim the legislation would "kick millions of people off their health insurance," which Republicans have labeled "blatantly false" [2]. Republican Senator Joni Ernst has defended proposed Medicaid cuts with the statement that "we all are going to die" [3].

Survey data indicates that Americans perceive Republicans as growing more comfortable expressing their views publicly while Democrats are becoming less so [1]. President Trump's approval rating has reportedly changed direction specifically among male voters [2].

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Branch Developments

### 1.1 Presidential Authority and Decision-Making

President Trump has significantly expanded executive authority across multiple domains. The administration has accelerated clemency processes that appear to favor political allies [1]. The White House has simultaneously terminated multiple HIV vaccine studies [2]. The president's approach to legal constraints has drawn attention, with reports suggesting a dismissive attitude toward laws limiting executive action [3]. This extends to media relations, where Trump reportedly admitted retaliatory motives in an executive order targeting NPR [4]. Meanwhile, the Army has warned that the administration's planned military parade could cause $16 million in damage to Washington streets [5].

### 1.2 Presidential Rhetoric and Institutional Claims

Recent presidential statements have raised questions about institutional boundaries. President Trump has reportedly claimed the Library of Congress as his personal institution despite its status as a legislative branch entity [1]. Following what headlines describe as an assassination attempt, Trump's rhetoric has reportedly taken on increasingly messianic tones [2]. Meanwhile, the president's proposed $34 million statue garden has been characterized by sculpture experts as "completely unworkable" due to technical problems [3].

### 1.3 Doge and Elon Musk's Departure

Elon Musk's exit from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) follows a contentious tenure. Headlines characterize his departure as a swift fall after serving as Trump's "chainsaw-wielding sidekick" in cutting government programs [1]. Reports allege he "took so much ketamine campaigning it damaged his bladder" [2] and appeared at an Oval Office press conference with a black eye following drug use allegations [3]. Steve Bannon has claimed Musk and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had a "physical confrontation" [4]. Musk publicly characterized U2's Bono as a "liar/idiot" for claims about USAID cuts' impact [5].

## 2. Domestic Policy

### 2.1 Scientific Research and Public Health

The administration's funding reductions have significantly impacted scientific and public health infrastructure. Major research institutions are struggling, causing international scientists to seek opportunities outside the United States [1]. Cuts to public health funding have reportedly eroded foundational capabilities and reversed previous progress [2]. The White House is also expected to withdraw its NASA nominee, Jared Isaacman [3].

### 2.2 Healthcare and Medicaid Changes

Proposed Medicaid cuts in a Republican bill have emerged as a significant political flashpoint ahead of the 2026 congressional elections [1]. The controversy intensified after Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) defended the cuts with the statement "well, we all are going to die" during a town hall meeting [2]. Following public backlash, Ernst doubled down by releasing what reports describe as a "sarcastic video 'apology'" [3].

### 2.3 Technology and AI Regulation

Artificial intelligence is poised to significantly disrupt white-collar employment, with one CEO forecasting a "white-collar bloodbath" as AI technologies increasingly automate professional tasks [1]. Simultaneously, Republican lawmakers are pushing legislation that would prohibit states from creating their own AI regulations, a move critics contend would primarily benefit large technology companies [2].

### 3.2 Surveillance and Data Collection

Government data collection practices have expanded in ways that raise privacy concerns. U.S. immigration authorities are reportedly collecting DNA information from children and storing it in criminal databases [1]. Simultaneously, the Trump administration is pursuing what critics describe as a "secretive" effort to centralize government data on millions of Americans [2].

### 4.2 Financial Markets and Budget Concerns

Concerns about U.S. economic stability have emerged following a recent government bond auction, with one analysis suggesting "Trump's economic house of cards may soon collapse" [1]. Energy Department workers have warned that budget reductions are "going to increase prices on everybody" [2]. Critics have characterized the administration's budget request as prioritizing wealthy Americans—"'No Billionaire Left Behind'"—while "trashing workers, struggling families" [3].

## 5. Electoral Politics

### 5.1 Public Opinion Trends

Recent polling data reveals mixed political fortunes across party lines. President Trump's approval rating has reportedly reached its "second-term low" according to what one source describes as "the most accurate pollster" [1].

Electoral integrity concerns and strategic positioning dominate state-level developments. The Justice Department reports that a student charged with voting illegally in Michigan has fled to China [1]. In Iowa, President Trump's current agenda is reportedly colliding with positioning for the 2028 presidential election cycle [2]. Looking ahead, June will feature 40 notable elections across the country [3].

Immigration enforcement continues to generate controversy. A case involving an undocumented individual accused of threatening President Trump has come under scrutiny amid allegations the person "may be victim of frame-up" [1]. A Washington Catholic school has alleged that students of color were "singled out" during a border crossing incident with Canadian authorities [2]. The scale of deportation operations has reportedly grown substantially, with one analysis describing a "'billion dollar border industrial complex' blossoming under Trump's deportation program" [3].

### 6.2 LGBTQ+ Rights and Policies

Recent developments signal tensions around LGBTQ+ visibility and rights. PBS has reportedly removed both a drag queen-themed children's episode and a trans-inclusive gaming documentary following Republican complaints [1]. Some LGBTQ+ travelers are reportedly "skipping America this Pride season" due to "safety concerns, a hostile political environment and uncertainty about border policies" [2].

## 7. Congressional Politics

### 7.1 Democratic Strategy

Democratic Party leadership faces challenges as it develops its opposition strategy. Younger Democratic representatives are reportedly positioning themselves to "threaten Nancy Pelosi and the old guard" [1]. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has urged Democrats to adopt a more aggressive posture, suggesting it's time to "be a little meaner" and calling Trump a "cruel man" [2]. Representative Seth Moulton has called for greater tolerance of dissenting ideas on controversial issues [3].

**Step 2**

Merging:

Please faithfully merge all summary chunks into one single summary of the day, in a very similar tone, format, style and length of those individual summary chunks. 

Length Requirement: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

You must make sure all the news facts are accurate, news titles are accurate, and the URLs are precise. There are hierarchical areas and topics in each summary article. Between summary articles, those area and topic categories are overlapping but not identical, because they were individually determined by LLMs. You must combine those areas and topics intelligently. You can reference to the merged hierarchical categories in the last round, and you can refine the categories if you like.

Because you need to keep the length of the overall summary about the same as individual summary chunks, you may adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas.  Although the citations have already been carefully selected, some articles are still better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. In that case, please think carefully and pick up the most important contents within the constraint of the total word count and number of citations. **In each topic, the citations count from [1].**

Please first think through and write out the merged hierarchical categories. Then, think intelligently, and write the entire summary.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Use readable and accessible language. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

Length Requirement Repeated for Emphasis: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Branch Developments

### 1.1 DOGE and Elon Musk's Departure

Conflicting information surrounds Elon Musk's status at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Despite reports of his departure, President Trump has stated Musk is "not really leaving" [1]. A federal judge has expanded DOGE's authority by approving Treasury DOGE team's access to sensitive data systems [2]. Analysis challenges Musk's claims of "chainsawing government spending," suggesting the impact has been "more like a trim" [3]. Musk's tenure has been marked by controversy, with reports of a "physical confrontation" with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent [4] and allegations about drug use that the White House has declined to address [5]. He recently branded U2's Bono a "liar/idiot" for claims about USAID cuts' impact [6].

### 1.2 Presidential Authority and Decision-Making

President Trump's use of executive authority spans multiple domains. He recently fired the Director of the National Portrait Gallery, citing issues related to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives [1]. The president has accelerated clemency processes, pardoning individuals described as "drug kingpins" while simultaneously intensifying rhetoric on drug crimes [2]. When asked about former President Biden's cancer diagnosis, Trump expressed that he doesn't "feel sorry" for Biden, describing him as "vicious" [3]. Reports indicate that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is considering reformatting Trump's intelligence briefings as video presentations resembling Fox News broadcasts, as Trump has been taking these briefings less frequently than his predecessors [4]. The Army has warned that Trump's planned military parade could cause $16 million in damage to Washington streets [5].

### 1.3 Federal Workforce and Institutional Changes

New hiring guidelines require federal job applicants to write essays demonstrating how they would advance Trump's policy priorities, focusing on hiring "patriotic Americans" [1]. An appeals court has maintained a block on the administration's attempts to downsize the federal workforce [2]. President Trump has claimed the Library of Congress as his personal institution despite its status as a legislative branch entity [3]. Meanwhile, sculpture experts have characterized Trump's proposed $34 million statue garden as "completely unworkable" due to technical problems [4].

## 2. Economic Policy

### 2.1 Tariffs and International Trade

President Trump's trade policies continue to expand with measurable economic impacts. New executive orders could effectively end Chinese drone sales in the United States [1]. Trump has implemented 50% tariffs on steel while celebrating what he described as a "blockbuster" deal with Japan [2]. Import volumes have reportedly experienced a significant decline, characterized as an "early sign of Trump tariff impact" [3].

The Trump administration's fiscal policies face increasing scrutiny. Wall Street entities have warned administration officials that the Republican tax legislation could potentially disrupt bond markets [1]. The White House has released a partial budget document that omits important details [2]. Concerns about U.S. economic stability have emerged following a recent government bond auction [3]. Energy Department workers have warned that budget reductions are "going to increase prices on everybody" [4].

Questions are being raised about the practicality of President Trump's vision for "Made in America" iPhones [1]. Congress has formed a Robotics Caucus specifically focused on countering China's advances in this strategic technology sector [2]. Artificial intelligence is poised to significantly disrupt white-collar employment, with one CEO forecasting a "white-collar bloodbath" [3]. Republican lawmakers are pushing legislation that would prohibit states from creating their own AI regulations [4].

## 3. Foreign Policy and National Security

### 3.1 Defense and Military Affairs

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has taken a firm stance on China's military activities, characterizing them as an "imminent" threat during a security conference in Singapore. Hegseth stated that China's army "is rehearsing for the real deal" and affirmed U.S. commitment to Indo-Pacific allies [1]. He has also called on Asian allies to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, matching levels he indicated are being reached in Europe [2]. A reporter for what's described as a "MAGA outlet" claims she was fired after criticizing Hegseth [3].

### 3.2 International Relations and Diplomacy

The Trump administration's approach to global affairs shows complex diplomatic positioning. A Trump envoy announced that the United Kingdom will join the United States at upcoming Ukraine-Russia peace talks, with messaging directed at Putin to "take the deal" [1]. In what appears to be a conciliatory stance, a Trump envoy has stated that Russia's concerns about NATO expansion are "fair" [2]. In Europe, reporting indicates U.S.-backed conservative political movements are gaining momentum and seeking to "go mainstream" [3]. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has offered a perspective on international threats, stating that China isn't America's biggest danger but rather "the enemy within" [4].

A U.S. general has warned that a terrorist group based in Africa has developed capabilities that could enable attacks within the United States [1]. One of President Trump's closest advisors has been impersonated after their phone was hacked [2]. U.S. immigration authorities are reportedly collecting DNA information from children and storing it in criminal databases [3]. Simultaneously, the Trump administration is pursuing what critics describe as a "secretive" effort to centralize government data on millions of Americans [4].

## 4. Healthcare and Social Programs

### 4.1 Healthcare Initiatives and Medicaid Changes

The Trump administration has terminated a program described as critical to the search for an HIV vaccine [1] and is reportedly ending multiple HIV vaccine studies [2]. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) report has come under scrutiny after it was found to contain references to nonexistent studies [3]. Republicans and Democrats are clashing over Medicaid changes in what Republicans term Trump's "big, beautiful bill." Democrats claim the legislation would "kick millions of people off their health insurance," which Republicans have labeled "blatantly false" [4]. Republican Senator Joni Ernst has defended proposed Medicaid cuts with the statement that "we all are going to die" [5], later doubling down with what reports describe as a "sarcastic video 'apology'" [6].

### 4.2 Public Health and Scientific Research

A new COVID subvariant is spreading rapidly as the Trump administration shifts away from vaccine-focused strategies [1]. Major research institutions are struggling under funding reductions, causing international scientists to seek opportunities outside the United States [2]. Deep cuts to public health funding have reportedly eroded foundational capabilities and reversed previous progress [3]. The White House is also expected to withdraw its NASA nominee, Jared Isaacman [4].

## 5. Immigration and Justice

### 5.1 Immigration Enforcement and Border Security

The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to cancel the legal status of approximately half a million immigrants [1]. Immigration agencies have increasingly conducted courthouse arrests, which critics argue deprives migrants of due process [2]. The administration has implemented specialized vetting for visa applicants with connections to Harvard University [3]. The Trump administration's approach to identifying "sanctuary jurisdictions" contains apparent inconsistencies, with the official list including some localities that actually support the President's immigration policies [4].

Length Control:

Now, it is the time to take a look at your document length again. Before you do anything else, count the words (without counting the URLs) and number of citations, and explicitly write those out. 

See if they fit to the desired range: **1300-1700 words (not counting the URLs), with 30-50 news article citations**. You should make smart adjustments within this range based on your feeling of how complex the topics are, and how many words and citations are really needed.

If not, please refine your summary, according to my requirements in Step 2. Especially, you should not make the language technical or dry, after you shortened the text. The language should always be readable and accessible. If you find other mistakes, please directly correct them. 

It may be attempting to rephrase or shorten the news titles. Absolutely NO! News titles and URLs must be exactly preserved.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed, but it is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summary very carefully. Every name, job title, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines. Be fully aware that your internal knowledge base is outdated.

You should produce the new daily_briefing.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.
