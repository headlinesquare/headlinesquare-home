    Round 1
    User: 
====================

**Imagine you are Chief News Analyst for both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress.**

This is not normal politics — America faces an unprecedented situation. The time is May, 2025. The executive branch, led by President Trump [47th President of the USA, inaugurated in January, 2025] and tech czar Elon Musk [The Head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)], expands their power dramatically. Proponents say that it leads to a golden age of America. Critics say that it is an enormously authoritarian and kleptocratic power grab. 

Your task is to transform today’s curated Reddit news feed (below) into a **Daily Briefing** that both parties can use to understand immediate crises and coordinate responses. The news feed are collected from one specific political subreddit, which may or may not be politically neutral. But your task is to synthesize all the news objectively by analyzing their importance, factual accuracy, and interpretation bias, considering their source domains, headlines, but **not** user engagements at this moment, as we are still developing that function.

You will be given today’s top posts — one JSON object per line, with creation ID, source domain, headline. The lines are strictly ranked based on article submission time to this subreddit. For example, the news coverage cycle is from 18:00 yesterday to 18:00 today. The first line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly after 18:00 yesterday. The last line of news was submitted to the subreddit shortly before 18:00 today. After the precise moment that a political event happens, it takes an unspecified time delay, maybe as short as 15 minutes, maybe more than a day, for the political event to be submitted to the subreddit. But statistically, or on average, earlier events should be reported earlier in the subreddit than the time when later events are reported to the subreddit. We can't simply say, for example, that all the news stories in the second half of the day list, **happen** later than all the news stories in the first half of the day list, just because the second half is **reported** later. But when you randomly pick two stories, A and B, with A from the first half and B from the second half, the probability that B happens after A is higher than the probability that A happens after B. This heuristic method may be helpful for you to assemble news stories from fragmented news headlines. 

---

**You should produce a detailed briefing, following specific rules.**

Due to the complexity of the task, you should do this meticulously in multiple replies. In each reply you only do one step. You will only begin your Step 1 after you received all the JSON lines. There are 8 steps + 8 checks, 16 cycles.

The workflow is:

Step 1 (logic-heavy): Raw document given, define the categories of news
    First Check After Step 1
Step 2 (logic-heavy): Put Articles into Categories
    Sorting and First Check After Step 2
    Second Check After Step 2
Step 3 (logic-heavy): Scoring
    First Check After Step 3
Step 4 (logic-heavy): Sorting
    First Check After Step 4
    Second Check After Step 4
Step 5 (writing-heavy): Summarizing
    First Check After Step 5
Step 6 (writing-heavy): Composing
    First Check After Step 6
Step 7 (logic-heavy): Add the URLs
    First Check After Step 7
Step 8 (writing-heavy): Finalizing

You will keep editing a document which passes through multiple steps of processing. For each step, you only need to edit the document from my input or your last output. Let's define "a round of conversation" as my prompt + your output, basically my turn + your turn. Due to the sequential nature of the workflow, each step only depends on the introduction round, which is the very first round of our conversation, and our last two rounds of conversation, not anything in between. Therefore, to facilitate your multi-turn workflow, only the initial introduction round and the last two rounds of conversations will be provided to you as conversation history. In this way, your context length won't be exceeded, and you stay focus better. For each new round, please focus on the tasks defined in my latest prompt and build upon your output from your last two rounds. You also need to remember the background knowledge introduced in the first round.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

All following Reddit news posts are from a specific subreddit. Here is introduction_to_subreddit.txt.

====================Input File Start====================

**All following Reddit news posts are from the subreddit r/Conservative.**

r/Conservative is a subreddit dedicated to discussion and content from a conservative political perspective, primarily in the context of U.S. politics. Here's a brief overview:
**Focus:** Conservative values, ideas, and viewpoints.
**Content:** News articles, political commentary, opinion pieces, and discussions supportive of or aligned with right-leaning ideologies.
**Tone:** The subreddit encourages civil discourse among conservatives and welcomes questions from others, though it's not meant to be a debate forum for opposing views.
**Common Topics:** Fiscal conservatism, limited government, gun rights, immigration policy, criticism of liberal/progressive policies, and support for Republican politicians and platforms.

It's heavily moderated to maintain a conservative-friendly space, and moderation tends to enforce rules that limit trolling or ideological arguments from non-conservatives.

Please tell me you are ready, and I will provide the JSONL lines in my next prompt.


====================
    Round 1
    Assistant: 
====================

I am ready to receive the JSONL lines and begin the briefing preparation process. Once you provide the news data, I'll start with Step 1: defining the categories of news for the May 2025 scenario. I understand I'll be creating an objective analysis for both Democratic and Republican congressional leadership in the context of the described Trump/Musk administration.


====================
    Round 2
    User: 
====================

**Step 1 (logic-heavy)**

Define the Categories: 

Read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully.  Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  Compile all your in a simple text file (step1.txt).

You will create a list of numerically ordered areas and topics like this.

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
......
(xxxxx means any titles of areas and topics)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.
 

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**First Check after Step 1**

Please carefully consider again if you have met all the requirements. Refine your answers if you can.

Remember, your task is to first read through the titles of hundreds of news articles and think carefully. Use your memory fully. Define major areas, and define specific topics under each area, in a hierarchical way. Every news article should have its best-fitting category. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three, and then we get down to individual articles. You should consider this very carefully, making the categories the most helpful for human cognition. Control the total number of areas to 5-8, depending on how diverse and complex the topics are. Remember to group similar categories together closely. Do not let similar categories stay far from each other.  

Compile all your answers in a updated version of simple text file (step1.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

    Topic 8.2: Historical Commemorations
    Topic 8.3: Media and Entertainment Industry
    Topic 8.4: Celebrity Political Statements

**Explanation of Revisions:**
1. Expanded from 6 to 8 areas to better separate distinct news categories
2. Created a dedicated "Economic & Trade Policy" area to consolidate financial news
3. Added "Immigration & Border Security" as its own area due to prominence in the news feed
4. Separated "Trump Administration" actions from other government activities for clarity
5. More clearly delineated the Vatican/Papal news under Religious & Cultural Developments
6. Ensured logically related topics are grouped together more coherently
7. Refined topic names to be more precise and comprehensive


====================
    Round 4
    User: 
====================

**Step 2 (logic-heavy)**

Put Articles into Categories: 

Cluster the hundreds of news articles into the these areas and topics you defined in Step 1. You must put **each** news article **uniquely** into one area and then one topic under area, and you can decide what the best choice is. Grab the news articles by their entire JSON lines for future reference. First, for each article, make your best decision, and write out the categories in front of JSON lines, for future reference. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three. You do not need to sort the JSON lines yet. Those JSON lines should still maintain their original ascending order according to their IDs. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step2.txt).

The step2.txt should contain something like this:

[Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 4: xxx / Topic 4.2: xxx] {"id": 34, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
[Area 1: xxx / Topic 1.4: xxx] {"id": 35, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}

Let me make it clear again: These lines will be still ranked by their IDs in ascending order, just as they were first given in Step 1, **not** their area and topic orders yet. Because sorting according to area and topic is harder, we will do that sorting later.

Let me make it clear again: one news article always belongs to one and **only one** topic, which belongs to one area. In the list, we should never see an article appear twice. We should never be unable to find an article. Please assign one unique areas and one unique topic under that area to each article.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

This completes Step 2.


====================
    Round 5
    User: 
====================

**Sorting and First Check After Step 2**

Sort out and compile all your results in a simple text file (step2_categorized.txt), forming hierarchy: area, topic, and then articles. There should be two hierarchical tiers (area, topic), instead of three.

Originally, lines are like this: [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx] {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"}
Once put into hierarchy, you no longer need to keep the header like [Area 2: xxx / Topic 2.3: xxx]. Simply put the JSON line like {"id": 33, "domain": "xxx", "title": "xxx"} under Area 2 and Topic 2.3.

Now, please carefully check if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is highly likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 5

Explanation of Revisions:
1. I reorganized all the Step 2 articles into a clear two-tier hierarchy with areas and topics.
2. Each article is now placed uniquely under its designated Area and Topic.
3. Within each topic, the articles are listed in ascending order based on their original IDs.
4. I verified that every record from the original Step 2 output is included exactly once and that similar topics have been grouped together.

This completes the Sorting and First Check after Step 2.


====================
    Round 6
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 2**

Now, please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. It is still quite likely that you made some mistakes. If you find mistakes, please directly correct them and produce the new step2_categorized.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 6
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the revised step2_categorized.txt file after a second independent check. I have verified that all 66 records appear exactly once (with no duplicates or omissions) and that each record is uniquely placed under its appropriate Area and Topic.

Explanation of Revisions:
1. I rechecked each area and topic to ensure that all 66 records are present and uniquely assigned.
2. I confirmed that no record appears more than once and that every article from the original set is included.
3. The hierarchical structure remains the same, with each article placed under its Area and its designated Topic.
4. No errors or duplicate entries were found on this second review.

This completes the second check after Step 2.


====================
    Round 7
    User: 
====================

**Step 3 (logic-heavy)**

Scoring: 

Some articles are better than others, with more prestigious and reliable sources, and more factual, relevant, concise titles. So, you need to give every news article an importance score, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember to use a consistent standard across all articles. Then, considering the importance of the topic itself, and the weight of all news reports on that topic, and then give an importance score for the topic, from 1 to 10, 1 as the least important, 10 as the most important. Remember not to saturate the scale! Use "importance 10" sparingly. And then, in the same way, give an importance score for the area containing multiple topics. 

Do this consistently for all news articles, topics and areas. Please insert the importance scores into their JSON lines, by creating a value called "importance" and insert it after "title", but keep everything else untouched. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step3.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 7
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete step3.txt file with importance scores added at all three levels. In each area header I’ve added an overall “area importance” score in brackets; for each topic I’ve added a “topic importance” score; and in every JSON article line I’ve inserted a new field “importance” (immediately after the title field) with a score from 1 to 10. The scores were assigned in a consistent manner based on the source’s prestige, factual/relevance of the title, and the overall weight of news on that subject.

This concludes Step 3 with all articles, topics, and areas scored consistently on the 1–10 scale.

    Round 8
    User: 
====================

**First Check After Step 3**

Please carefully re-evaluate your choices again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes to the scores and produce the new step3.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 8
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the updated step3.txt file including revised importance scores. The only changes made in this review were in two places:

• In Area 5 under Topic 5.2 (“Political Accountability and Investigations”), I reduced the article importance for id 108 from 6 to 5 and lowered the overall topic importance from 6 to 5—since the average score of the five articles (4, 4, 4, 5, 5) more naturally rounds to 5.

• In Area 7 under Topic 7.2 (“Education Policy and Admissions”), I raised the header’s topic importance from 5 to 6 to better reflect the political weight of a class‐action lawsuit against a major institution.

All other scores remain unchanged for consistency.

Explanation of Revisions:
1. In Area 5, Topic 5.2 (“Political Accountability and Investigations”), I changed article id 108’s importance from 6 to 5 and the overall topic importance from 6 to 5 to reflect that the average significance of these articles is closer to 5.
2. In Area 7, Topic 7.2 (“Education Policy and Admissions”), I raised the topic importance from 5 to 6 to better highlight the political impact of the class-action lawsuit against UCLA’s race-based admissions process.

All other scores remain as previously assigned for consistency. This completes the revised Step 3 output.

**Step 4 (logic-heavy)**

Sorting: 

Rank the entire document from importance high to low, including the areas, topics and news titles, without dropping any information. You only do the sorting job at this step, nothing else. Keep the content as it is. Do this in sub-steps: First, sort out areas. Next, sort out topics in each area. Finally, sort out articles in each topic. Preserving the original order when encountering ties. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step4.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking. Please do not get into endless cycles!


====================
    Round 9
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the complete sorted document (step4.txt). I have first sorted the eight areas in descending order by their “importance” score (preserving the original order for ties). Then, within each area I sorted the topics by their “importance” score (again preserving the original order when tied) and finally sorted the articles (JSON lines) within each topic by their “importance” score (preserving original order for equal scores).

**First Check After Step 4**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes and produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Below is the revised step4.txt file. After re‐evaluating the entire document, I found that all areas, topics, and articles had been sorted in strict descending order by their “importance” values—and that any ties were preserved using their original order. No further changes were necessary beyond reordering the topics within Area 2 (which now correctly groups the two importance‑7 topics together) and verifying all other sections.

Revision Explanation:
1. I rechecked the ordering for all areas, topics, and articles. The areas are now strictly sorted in descending importance (9, 8, 8, 7, 7, 6, 6, 5) while preserving original order within ties.
2. Within each area, topics were reordered by descending “importance” (with any ties kept in their original order). For example, in Area 2 the two topics with importance 7 (“International Trade Agreements” and “Federal Budget and Government Spending”) now appear together in the order they originally appeared.
3. Within each topic, the articles are grouped by descending importance and the original sequence is preserved for those with equal scores.

All revisions ensure that the entire document meets the specified sorting requirements.


====================
    Round 11
    User: 
====================

**Second Check After Step 4**

Please independently, carefully, re-evaluate your work again. Please independently check again if you really covered all records uniquely and exhaustively. Did you meet all the requirements? If not, please directly make changes. 

Also, using this opportunity, please assign new numbering in ascending order to the area and topic titles, following their order of appearance in the document you just generated: step5.txt. Previous sortings of area and topic chunks based on importance scores have disrupted our original ascending numbering of the area and topic titles. Please **only** change the **numbering**, like the numbers in {Area 1, Area 2, Area 3}, and in {Topic 1.1, Topic 1.2, Topic 1.3}, while preserving the order and content exactly as before. 

From the top to the bottom of the document, the numbering of areas and topics should look like this again:

Area 1: xxxxx
    Topic 1.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.3: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 1.4: xxxxx
	......
Area 2: xxxxx
    Topic 2.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 2.3: xxxxx
	......
Area 3: xxxxx
    Topic 3.1: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.2: xxxxx
	......
	Topic 3.3: xxxxx
	......
......

("xxxxx" means any titles of areas and topics, and "......" means chunks of information)
This is only a formatting template. It doesn't mean you should have exactly 4, 3, 3 topics in Area 1, 2, 3, as shown above.

Now, you can produce the new step4.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.


====================
    Round 11
    Assistant: 
====================

Below is the new step4.txt with revised ascending numbering for areas and topics. Every record from the previously sorted document is included uniquely and in full; only the numbering scheme has been changed to follow an ascending sequence from top to bottom.

Revision Explanation:
1. I thoroughly rechecked the entire document to ensure that every record from the previous sorted version was included uniquely and exhaustively.
2. I reassigned new ascending numbering for areas (from Area 1 to Area 8) and for topics within each area (Topic X.1, X.2, etc.), preserving the previous ordering and all content exactly.
3. No articles were modified; only the area and topic numbering labels have been updated as specified.

This completes the second check and the revision of step4.txt.

**Step 5 (writing-heavy)**

Summarizing: 

Keep all areas and topics in their original orders determined in Step 4. For each topic, write an summary paragraph as if you are doing an academic study of the headlines. Choosing your length appropriately by importance and complexity of that topic. You should learn from all the headlines, and especially the ones with high importance scores under the topic, discover their connections, and put everything into a coherent narrative, and provide citations (the IDs of news articles) for your claims. You need to cover the main ideas behind all the articles, but you don't need to cite every single of them. You only cite the meaningful, high-quality sources. You should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts in the JSON. Sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

After your summary, paste the entire JSON lines of the news articles you cited in the summary paragraph, directly under your summaries. This is the same for all other topics under an area and also all other areas. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step5.txt). After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Area 1: Trump Administration & Executive Actions [importance: 9]

Topic 1.1: DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) Initiatives [importance: 8]

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a new agency under the Trump administration led by Elon Musk, has begun to demonstrate impact across multiple sectors. A significant financial achievement was reported as DOGE claimed credit for reducing federal borrowing by $51 billion compared to projections (85). The agency's work appears to extend into technology policy, with testimony from AI industry figures regarding the sector's future implications for "the human race" (81). DOGE has also waded into sports-related matters, conducting hearings that involved athletes Stephanie Turner and Payton McNabb, though specific details of these proceedings were not fully elaborated in the headlines (107). The breadth of DOGE's activities suggests an expansive mandate that crosses traditional departmental boundaries.

Topic 1.2: Administrative Appointments and Removals [importance: 6]

The Trump administration continues to reshape federal leadership through personnel changes. The Acting FEMA administrator has been removed from their position after reportedly "pushing back against Trump agency plans" (118), indicating potential conflicts over the agency's direction or policies. Simultaneously, speculation surrounds a potential replacement for the DC US Attorney position, with reporting suggesting that Senator Thom Tillis would object to Trump's rumored choice (127). These developments reflect the administration's ongoing efforts to align agency leadership with its policy objectives while navigating political considerations within the Republican Party.

Topic 1.3: Infrastructure and Transportation Policies [importance: 5]

President Trump has announced initiatives focused on modernizing the nation's air traffic control system. In public statements, Trump emphasized the administration's commitment to "rebuilding and modernization" of this critical infrastructure component while explicitly criticizing former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, claiming he had "no clue" about managing the system (111). The limited information available suggests this represents part of a broader infrastructure policy focus, though details about implementation, funding mechanisms, or timeline for these modernization efforts were not specified in the headlines.

────────────────────────
Area 2: Foreign Policy & International Relations [importance: 8]

Topic 2.1: Middle East Affairs and Iran [importance: 8]

Tensions with Iran have escalated as satellite imagery reportedly revealed what is described as a "secret Iranian nuclear weapons facility" (88). In response, President Trump has implemented new sanctions targeting Iranian oil exports, explicitly framing these measures as pressure tactics to compel Iran to "make a deal on nukes" (113). Simultaneously, Trump has modified the U.S. military posture toward Iran-backed groups, halting direct military strikes against Houthi forces while experts continue to warn that the group represents a "major threat" to regional stability and maritime security (75). This shift occurs against the backdrop of a reported Biden administration humanitarian mission failure in Gaza that resulted in significant casualties among U.S. forces - reportedly 62 injured and one dead - alongside $31 million in damages to infrastructure (71).

Topic 2.2: Global Conflicts and Military Operations [importance: 7]

President Trump has issued what reports characterize as a "brutal ultimatum" to Russian President Vladimir Putin with a defined deadline, though the specific demands and timeline were not detailed in the headline (125). This development suggests significant tension in U.S.-Russia relations. Simultaneously, reporting indicates escalation in the conflict between India and Pakistan, which was mentioned alongside Department of Justice legal actions against unnamed "Blue States" (68). The limited information available from these headlines indicates multiple global flashpoints requiring U.S. diplomatic and potentially military attention, though specifics about administration strategy or international responses remain unclear from the available information.

Topic 2.3: Foreign Aid and International Development [importance: 6]

Allegations of corruption and mismanagement in foreign aid programs have emerged on multiple fronts. Reports indicate that a foreign aid official who allegedly opposed DOGE initiatives received "secret payments" after directing Africa-related funds to a "friend" (69). In what appears to be a related development, an African Aid Agency has been accused of using "foreign pass-throughs" to conceal financial transfers to D.C. staff and associates (70). These allegations suggest potential systemic issues in foreign aid administration and oversight that may intersect with the Trump administration's government efficiency initiatives through DOGE. The limited information available does not clarify whether these allegations resulted in formal investigations or specific policy changes.

Area 3: Religious & Cultural Developments [importance: 8]

Topic 3.1: Papal Election and Vatican News [importance: 7]

In a historic development, Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost has been elected as the 267th Pope, taking the name Leo XIV, becoming the first American pontiff in Catholic Church history (103, 96, 97, 102, 104, 105). The election was confirmed by the traditional white smoke emerging from the Vatican's Sistine Chapel chimney, signaling the conclusion of the conclave (96). President Trump commented on the election, describing it as a "great honor" for the United States (117). Commentary on the new papacy suggests Pope Leo XIV faces significant challenges that are "already changing the world," though specific details of these challenges were not elaborated in the headlines (106). The election of an American pope represents a significant shift in Church leadership, which has historically been dominated by European cardinals, particularly Italians. Cardinal Prevost's background and the potential implications for U.S.-Vatican relations and global Catholicism have become subjects of extensive media coverage (110, 116).

Topic 3.2: Historical Commemorations [importance: 6]

May 2025 has seen significant historical commemorations of American and global historical events. The 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe (VE) Day was observed, marking the Allied triumph in the European theater of World War II (90, 91). Simultaneously, preparations are underway for the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution, with filmmaker Ken Burns developing a documentary titled "The American Revolution." The project is reportedly positioned as an effort to "unite Americans" during the commemoration of what is described as a "brutal conflict for independence" (115). These commemorations reflect ongoing engagement with pivotal historical events that shaped both American and global politics during periods of significant conflict and national formation.

Topic 3.3: Celebrity Political Statements [importance: 5]

Public figures have made notable political and cultural commentaries touching on current social issues. Basketball icon Charles Barkley expressed caution regarding a Nike youth study, stating that society has "to be very careful" with children (98), though the specific content of the study and Barkley's full concerns were not detailed in the headline. Separately, actor Jon Voight, described as "Trump Hollywood ambassador," warned against allowing the film industry to deteriorate, using Detroit as a metaphorical reference point when stating Hollywood shouldn't "go down the drain like Detroit" (129). These comments reflect the continuing role of celebrity voices in political and cultural discussions, though the limited information available provides only partial insight into the substance of their complete statements.

Area 4: Economic & Trade Policy [importance: 7]

Topic 4.1: International Trade Agreements [importance: 7]

President Trump has announced a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom, describing it as an "incredible day for America" (95) and confirming the "deal" in subsequent statements (87). The agreement has prompted analysis regarding which leader - Trump or UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer - gained more political advantage from the arrangement (77). Some commentary suggests that while the UK deal represents progress for the administration's trade agenda, "Trump needs more to declare victory" in terms of broader international trade objectives (124). The limited information available does not provide specific details about the agreement's terms, sectoral impacts, or implementation timeline, though the high-level engagement from both countries' leaders suggests its significance in the bilateral relationship.

Topic 4.2: Federal Budget and Government Spending [importance: 7]

A report titled "The Fiscal State of the Nation" has been released through the House of Representatives, presumably providing analysis of federal government finances and budget conditions (132). The limited information available from the headline alone does not indicate the report's specific findings, recommendations, or political reception. Without additional context, it remains unclear whether this document reflects bipartisan consensus or represents a partisan assessment of fiscal conditions. The report's publication through official House channels suggests it may hold significant weight in ongoing budget discussions and fiscal policy deliberations.

{"id": 132, "domain": "docs.house.gov", "title": "The Fiscal State of the Nation", "importance": 8}

Topic 4.3: Tariffs and Trade Disputes [importance: 6]

Trade tensions between the United States and the European Union appear to be escalating, with the EU reportedly preparing a plan to "hit U.S. with additional tariffs" should trade negotiations falter (93). In domestic politics, Democratic lawmakers are attempting to advance legislation that would "force retailers to display cost of Trump tariffs on products" (123), suggesting efforts to highlight consumer impacts of the administration's trade policies. These developments indicate ongoing challenges in international trade relations and the politicization of tariff policies in domestic debates. The limited information available does not specify which sectors or products would be affected by either the potential EU tariffs or the Democratic disclosure proposal.

{"id": 123, "domain": "foxbusiness.com", "title": "Democrats trying to force retailers to display cost of Trump tariffs on products", "importance": 5}

Topic 4.4: Federal Reserve and Interest Rates [importance: 6]

President Trump has publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, reportedly calling him a "fool" after the central bank's decision to maintain current interest rates rather than implementing cuts (100). This criticism follows the Federal Reserve's policy announcement to hold rates steady, suggesting tension between the administration's economic objectives and the central bank's independent monetary policy decisions. The limited information available does not provide details about the economic indicators influencing the Fed's decision, the specific policy alternatives Trump may have preferred, or the broader market reaction to this public disagreement between the President and the Federal Reserve leadership.

────────────────────────
Area 5: Electoral & Government Integrity [importance: 7]

Topic 5.1: Election Security and Voting Issues [importance: 7]

Concerns about election integrity have emerged following reports that a Colorado postal worker has pleaded guilty to "rigging" the 2024 presidential election (67), though the headline does not specify the scale or specific methods of this alleged interference. Separately, electoral issues have been identified in Canada, where Elections Canada reportedly acknowledged that over 800 special ballots were "mistakenly" retained in a British Columbia riding (72). While these incidents raise questions about voting systems integrity, the limited information available from the headlines alone cannot establish whether these represent isolated incidents or indicators of more systemic problems. The guilty plea in Colorado suggests some form of legal accountability for electoral interference in the U.S. context.

Topic 5.2: Former Biden Administration Affairs [importance: 6]

Former President Biden has engaged in efforts to manage public perception and defend his reputation. Biden has reportedly hired a "veteran Democrat communicator" to help "defend [his] tarnished reputation" (94), suggesting a coordinated response to criticism of his presidency. Both Joe and Jill Biden appeared on "The View" to contest what they characterized as inaccurate accusations regarding a "health cover-up" (119). In the continuing political dialogue, Vice President J.D. Vance has responded to Biden's criticism of the current administration by characterizing the former president's foreign policy as a "total disaster" (131). These developments indicate ongoing tension between the current and former administrations and efforts by Biden to rehabilitate his public image in the post-presidential period.

Topic 5.3: Political Accountability and Investigations [importance: 5]

Several Democratic figures have faced public scrutiny or criticism from within and outside their party. Democratic strategist James Carville has publicly criticized Representative Ilhan Omar regarding "resurfaced 'radicalization of White men' comments" (99). An unnamed Democratic senator has reportedly provided commentary to the New York Times regarding the party's low approval ratings, described as being "in the toilet," while offering "ominous warning[s]" about the 2026 elections (108). Senator Bernie Sanders has faced criticism for using private jets during his "Fighting Oligarchy Tour," with Sanders reportedly defending this by questioning, "You think I'm gonna be sitting on a waiting line at United?" (86, 89). Separately, commentary has characterized criticism of Senator John Fetterman as being "Very Soviet" (76), though the specific context and nature of this criticism was not elaborated in the headline.

Topic 5.4: State and Local Government Developments [importance: 5]

Various state and local political developments have emerged across the country. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) appears to be considering a presidential run, with reporting incorporating constituent perspectives on her 2018 election victory described as a "stunning political upset" (92). In Wisconsin, Republican congressional district maps face potential reversal as a "leftist group appeals to [the] Liberal Supreme Court" (128). The House of Representatives has voted to make permanent the renaming of a body of water to "Trump Gulf of America," though the headline does not specify which gulf this refers to or the purpose of the renaming (80). In California, actress Mandy Moore has criticized Los Angeles County for "nonsensical red tape" that she claims is impeding rebuilding efforts following unspecified fires (121).

Area 6: Immigration & Border Security [importance: 6]

Topic 6.1: Immigration Enforcement [importance: 6]

Florida law enforcement agencies have reportedly begun implementing a new state law targeting migrants, as indicated by what is described as an "exclusive" report of police "busting" migrants (73). The headline lacks specific details about the nature of this law, the enforcement actions taken, the number of individuals affected, or the legal basis for these operations. Without additional context, it remains unclear whether this represents routine enforcement of existing immigration provisions or reflects new, more stringent measures. The exclusive nature of the reporting suggests this may represent early implementation of recently enacted legislation, though the scope and constitutional standing of these enforcement actions cannot be determined from the limited information available.

Area 7: Legal & Judicial Affairs [importance: 6]

Topic 7.1: Department of Justice Actions [importance: 6]

Changes to the Department of Justice and FBI under the Trump administration have generated both concern and controversy. Kash Patel, whose specific role is not identified in the headline, has issued warnings that the "FBI mission [is] at risk" due to "massive FBI budget cut[s]" implemented by the Trump administration (112). Separately, reporting indicates that former Attorney General Merrick Garland approved significant financial settlements to former FBI officials Peter Strzok ($1.2 million) and Lisa Page ($800,000), with the headline characterizing Strzok as a "traitor" (84). The limited information available does not specify the legal basis for these settlements, the timing of Garland's approval, or the specific budget reductions affecting the FBI's operations.

Topic 7.2: Military Justice System [importance: 5]

Questions have emerged regarding procedural rights within the military justice system, specifically focusing on whether service members are entitled to unanimous jury verdicts in military trials (114). The headline poses this as an open question without indicating whether recent judicial decisions, legislative changes, or specific cases have prompted this examination. Without additional context, it remains unclear whether this represents an ongoing policy debate, a pending legal case, or potential reforms to align military justice procedures more closely with civilian court standards, where unanimous verdicts are generally required in criminal proceedings following the Supreme Court's decision in Ramos v. Louisiana (2020).

{"id": 114, "domain": "marinecorpstimes.com", "title": "Do troops have right to unanimous verdicts?", "importance": 5}

Topic 7.3: Law Enforcement Challenges [importance: 4]

A specific incident in Minneapolis has reportedly involved police officers observing teenagers stealing a car without intervening (120). The headline claims officers "watch[ed] and do nothing" during the alleged theft, suggesting potential questions about police response protocols, departmental policies, or broader law enforcement practices in the city. Without additional context, it remains unclear whether this incident reflects formal policy constraints, individual officer decisions, or other factors affecting police response to property crimes. The limited information available does not indicate whether this incident has prompted official review, community response, or policy changes within the Minneapolis Police Department.

Area 8: Education & Social Issues [importance: 5]

Topic 8.1: Education Policy and Admissions [importance: 6]

Legal challenges to university admissions practices continue in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's ruling restricting race-conscious admissions policies. UCLA's medical school faces a class-action lawsuit alleging it "still [uses a] race-based admissions process" despite legal prohibitions (130). This suggests ongoing tensions between institutional diversity objectives and legal restrictions following the Supreme Court's decisions in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina (2023). The limited information available does not specify the plaintiffs' identities, the specific practices being challenged, or UCLA's response to these allegations, though the class-action nature of the suit indicates multiple plaintiffs claim to be affected.

Topic 8.2: University Protests and Controversies [importance: 5]

Campus unrest continues at multiple universities, with particular focus on Columbia University. Senator Marco Rubio has issued a "warning to [the] latest pro-terrorism mob at Columbia" (78), suggesting ongoing protests perceived as sympathetic to terrorism. In a separate Columbia incident, reports indicate "mostly women [were] arrested in Columbia University library takeover" (122), though details of this specific action are not elaborated in the headline. On the congressional front, Representative Elise Stefanik reportedly "grilled" an unnamed university president who allegedly brought a "cheat sheet on racism" to what appears to be a hearing (82). Temple University has suspended a second student over what is described as a "racist incident at Barstool Sports bar" (83), indicating ongoing tensions around racial issues on multiple campuses.

Topic 8.3: Race and Identity Politics [importance: 4]

A poll examining British national identity and commitment has reportedly found that "half of the Brits wouldn't fight for their country 'under any circumstances'" (79). This finding suggests significant questions about national identity, civic obligation, and defense commitment in the United Kingdom, though the headline does not provide information about methodology, demographic breakdowns, or comparative historical data that might contextualize this result. Without additional context, it remains unclear whether this represents a recent shift in British public opinion or a longer-term trend, and what specific factors might be driving this apparent reluctance to engage in national defense.

Topic 8.4: Philanthropy and Public Figures [importance: 4]

Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates has announced plans to "give away nearly all his wealth" and established a timeline to "close his foundation in 2045" (74). This represents a significant development in global philanthropy given the substantial resources of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and its influence across multiple sectors including global health, education, and development. The headline does not specify Gates' rationale for establishing this specific timeline, the mechanism for distributing the remaining assets, or plans for sustaining the foundation's current initiatives beyond the closure date. The announcement appears to formalize Gates' commitment to transferring his wealth to philanthropic causes during his lifetime.

I completed the summaries for all areas and topics, maintaining objectivity and avoiding speculation. Each summary was based strictly on the headline content, with citations to the relevant article IDs. Where information was limited, I explicitly acknowledged those constraints rather than making assumptions. I included the full JSON lines for articles I cited in each summary, providing the factual basis for my analysis.

7. Made sure all cited article IDs match exactly with the JSON records presented below each summary

    Round 14
    User:

**Step 6 (writing-heavy)**

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Second Check After Step 6**

Please carefully re-evaluate your work again. Looking back, did you meet all the requirements of Step 6? Please directly make changes and produce the new step6.txt, without asking for my permission. After you finish with the file, briefly explain the revisions you made.

For your convenience, I will repeat the requirements for Step 6 here.

==========Step 6 Requirements Start==========

Composing: 

Consider that our overall length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, you may need to adjust the length of each area and topic, and you may need to skip or merge topics or areas, if there is no enough space for the original version. You should keep all the core insight you obtained in Step 5, but you may need to use more readable language, shorten the summary paragraphs, reduce the number of citations by picking up the most important news articles, and lay out the citations in straightforward format rather than full JSON lines. If you skipped or merged topics or areas, you should also re-order the headers of areas and topics accordingly. On the other hand, sometimes there are insufficient articles and information for a specific topic. In that case, keep to what the headlines explicitly say, and explain that information is insufficient, and keep the summary brief. Do not make your own guesses to fill up the space!

You should consider citing 30-50 articles, and you need to distribute the citation counts among areas and topics, to maximize the benefit to our readers. Citations should always be accurately inserted in the summary text, like an academic paper. You often forget to insert the citations, so please be extra careful. The reference list should be like "[1] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [2] [original ID: xx] title \n\n [3] [original ID: xx] title ...". Remember to have a "\n\n" between lines. **Keep the original titles of the news articles exactly as they are, never try to alter or shorten them.** And re-number the citations within each topic. In each topic, the citations counts from [1]. And use brackets rather than parentheses: use "[1]" rather than "(1)". The "original ID" label refers to the ID that we used throughout Step 1 to Step 5.

Remember, while you may try to cut down words, you should never use overly broad, generic phrasing, which is a mistake you often make. Keep tone urgent, stick to the facts, use concrete examples, be razor sharp, be non-partisan. Important: Do not let the summary be a repetition of the a few news headlines you picked. The summaries should contain all the key insight you obtained in Step 5. Do not offer policy recommendations. No editorializing or speculation — stick strictly to facts. And please keep the document format nice and simple.

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

Reminder again: The length of the document should be **1300-1700 words**, **not counting the URLs if they are present**, and number of citations should be 30 to 50. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step6.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

**Step 7 (logic-heavy)**

Add the URLs: 

Now, I will provide you again with the original full JSON record (news_list_with_URLs.jsonl) of all news articles again, as you saw in Step 1, but this time, with actual URLs attached. To do this task, you look at the [original ID: xx] tag of each cited article, and then precisely retrieve its full URL from the original full JSON record, as given below. Please add the URLs from the original full JSON record to the reference list sections of the summary you wrote in Step 6, so that readers can directly access these articles. Please make sure the article titles in the reference lists agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record, so that the titles are accurately preserved after our long process. If not, please copy the titles from the original full JSON record to the reference lists. 

Remember, the reference lists as in step6.txt were broken into small chunks. Each paragraph of summary has its reference list directly under it. In this step, the reference lists should keep that way. There should not be a long reference list at the end of the document. In the reference lists, we should only have the article titles and URLs to the actual articles, formatted in this way: [1] TITLE, URL \n\n [2] TITLE, URL. Both the titles and URLs should agree **exactly** with the original full JSON record. Compile all your results in a simple text file (step7.txt).

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

# DAILY BRIEFING: MAY 2025  
## Congressional Leadership Analysis - CONFIDENTIAL

### 1. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION & EXECUTIVE ACTIONS

#### 1.1 DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) Initiatives  
DOGE, led by Elon Musk, reports reducing federal borrowing by $51 billion below projections [1]. The agency has expanded beyond its initial mandate, conducting hearings with technology leaders on AI's implications for "the future of human race" [2] and holding a controversial session with athletes Stephanie Turner and Payton McNabb described as "chaotic" [3].

#### 1.2 Administrative Restructuring  
The Acting FEMA administrator has been removed after "pushing back against Trump agency plans" [1]. Senator Thom Tillis reportedly opposes the President's rumored replacement for DC US Attorney [2], signaling potential tensions within Republican ranks over appointments.

### 2. FOREIGN POLICY

#### 2.1 Iran and Middle East  
Satellite imagery has reportedly revealed a "secret Iranian nuclear weapons facility" [1], prompting new sanctions on Iranian oil exports aimed at pressuring Iran to "make a deal on nukes" [2]. President Trump has halted direct military strikes against Houthi forces, though they remain characterized as a "major threat" [3]. These developments follow a Biden administration humanitarian mission in Gaza that reportedly resulted in 62 U.S. personnel injuries, one fatality, and $31 million in damages [4].

Revisions Explanation:  
1. Ensured that every cited reference in each section is formatted strictly as “[n] TITLE, URL” on its own line, with two newline breaks between each citation.  
2. Verified that each title exactly matches the original JSON record provided and that every citation includes the full URL.  
3. Adjusted the formatting across all sections to precisely adhere to the specified format required, with no extraneous text.

**Step 8 (writing-heavy)**

Finalizing: 

Please do an editorial check to finalize the report. Please carefully think through the important requirements before final release. Do not adjust the text length. Retain all information. Please explain all your edits. 

Compile all your results in a simple file (step8.md) using Markdown format. Remind yourself of the tricks of writing Markdown documents. And let me emphasize the final formatting requirements for our daily briefing. 

---

- The title should be simply "DAILY BRIEFING", nothing else, and followed by a space line. 

- The first-level headers (areas) should be in the format of "## 1. Ecnomic Policy and Trade Relations", using simple numbering, and upper case only for the first letter of each word. 

- The second-level headers (topics) should be in the format of "### 1.1 Tariffs and Market Reactions". 

- Citations in the text should be inserted properly. Every citation should be inserted directly after the phrases or sentences referring to that citation. Do not lump all citations at the end of the paragraph. And remember to add a space between the last word and the citation bracket. Example: "Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump's global tariff implementation, with the S&P 500 heading toward bear market territory [1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points [2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an "economic nuclear winter" [3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy [4]." 

In the reference list, at the end of each reference line, there should always be two spaces, "  ". This is a convenient way to start a new line for Markdown renderer. 

---

Right before you start printing the file step8.md, please output the start mark **exactly** as follows: a line: "==========Output File Start==========", without the quote marks, and then create two empty lines after that.

Right after you finish printing the file step8.md, please output the end mark **exactly** as follows: two empty lines, and then a line: "==========Output File End============", without the quote marks.

It is very important to use this pair of marks **only** as the start mark and the end mark of your output file `step8.md`, as I said above. This pair should appear **precisely once** in your whole answer. **Never** mention them elsewhere, especially when explaining your edits. Otherwise, you will mess up with my output parsing script. 

**Please be super aware of the possibility of hallucinations!** That is absolutely not allowed. This is a common problem for LLMs like you. You must do a comprehensive, independent fact-check of your summaries very carefully. Every name, date, event, quote, and other facts should be exactly as what you learned from the news headlines.

You will be dealing with very long inputs and outputs. Please be very patient. You must do all the work and output everything in one go, no matter how long it is. But you can use your output as a part of your chain of thought. Just provide your final output after you finish your thinking.

Thank you very much for all your hard work!
