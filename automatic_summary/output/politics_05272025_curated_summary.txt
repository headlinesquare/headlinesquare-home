# DAILY BRIEFING

## 1. Executive Branch Actions

### 1.1 Presidential Directives and Federal Funding

The Trump administration continues reshaping federal policy through executive orders [1] while targeting specific institutions for funding cuts. The administration is moving to cancel approximately $100 million in federal contracts with Harvard University [2], with Trump describing the school as "very antisemitic" [3]. President Trump has also threatened to redirect $3 billion in federal grants from Harvard to trade schools [4] and to withhold California's federal funding over a transgender athlete issue [5].

NPR and Colorado public radio stations have filed legal action against the Trump White House over an executive order cutting federal funding [6]. The Government Accountability Office has ruled that the Transportation Department cannot withhold funds from the electric vehicle infrastructure program [7], and New York has won a bid to stop the U.S. from freezing funds in a congestion pricing dispute [8].

### 1.2 Presidential Pardons

President Trump has issued several controversial pardons. He pardoned former Virginia sheriff Scott Jenkins, who was convicted of fraud and bribery [1] and sentenced to 10 years for what one report describes as a "cash-for-badges scheme" [2]. The New York Times reports that Trump pardoned tax cheat Paul Walczak after his mother attended a $1 million dinner at Mar-a-Lago [3]. Trump has also pardoned reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, previously convicted of bank fraud and tax crimes [4]. Additionally, Trump's new pardon attorney personally reviewed an application for Jan. 6 ringleader Stewart Rhodes [5].

### 1.3 Department and Agency Activities

The Trump EPA is reportedly drafting a rule that would "undo decades of progress on limiting pollution from power plants" [1]. At the Department of Health and Human Services, Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has revoked COVID-19 shot recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women [2] and has proposed barring government scientists from publishing in leading medical journals [3].

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is facing challenges with the Bureau of Land Management reportedly ousting an official for "resisting DOGE" [4], while reports indicate DOGE's "5 things emails are dying a slow, quiet death" [5]. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth faces internal challenges and legal allegations including reports of illegal wiretapping [6].

## 2. Foreign Relations

### 2.1 Russia-Ukraine Relations

Russia has announced a prisoner exchange agreement with President Trump [1], while the administration is considering imposing new sanctions against Russia according to Wall Street Journal reporting [2]. Military tensions with Russia are intensifying as the U.S. reinforces Europe's northern front amid fears of a wider conflict [3].

President Trump has presented contradictory messages: admitting he has "no way to make Putin stop" as bombs fall on Kyiv [4], while also warning Putin he is "playing with fire" [5] and claiming he has protected Russia from "really bad things" [6]. These remarks have drawn criticism from Russian media [7], and Republicans are reportedly putting pressure on Trump over Russia, with one quoted saying "Putin has been jerking us around" [8].

### 2.2 International Trade and Diplomacy

U.S. trade relations have deteriorated, with the U.S. and EU locked in a "showdown over trade" [1]. The EU is reportedly "counting on Trump to blink first in trade spat" [2]. Tourists from countries hit by Trump tariffs are reportedly avoiding travel to the U.S. [3], and businesses affected by Trump's tariffs are seeking refunds [4].

The New York Times suggests Trump envisions "One World, Three Powers" in his foreign policy approach [5]. A ceasefire agreement negotiated to release hostages was rejected by Israel, with blame assigned to Hamas [6]. The U.S. is reportedly negotiating with Venezuela to allow increased oil sales in exchange for accepting more deportees [7].

## 3. Immigration and Border Policies

### 3.1 Deportation and Visa Restrictions

The Trump administration's deportation policies are creating urgent situations. A 4-year-old with a critical medical condition faces deportation that doctors warn could be fatal "within a matter of days" [1]. In another case, a gay man was deported to a country where he was subsequently raped, with allegations that administration officials "lied to the judge twice" during proceedings [2].

The administration has halted student visa processing, with Bloomberg reporting "Trump pauses all Student Visa Vetting Interviews" [3]. This pause comes as the government reportedly prepares to implement "expanded social media vetting" for all foreign students [4]. Meanwhile, Venezuelans legally in the U.S. under Temporary Protected Status are seeing their lives "upended" by a Supreme Court order on TPS [5].

### 3.2 Border Enforcement

Immigration enforcement has intensified, with ICE reportedly arresting a high school student at a "routine immigration hearing" [1] and tapping into a "nationwide AI-enabled camera network" [2]. Border security has drawn scrutiny, with reports that the Border Czar's security detail costs "taxpayers $1 million a month" [3].

The Washington Post reports potential conflicts of interest, noting that "Trump's border czar consulted for immigrant detention firm GEO Group" [4]. A judge has accused the Trump administration of "manufacturing chaos in migrant deportation case" [5].

## 4. Legal and Constitutional Issues

The Supreme Court is entering a decisive phase as it is "poised to decide cases on birthright citizenship, transgender care and religion" [1]. It recently declined to hear the Oak Flat case, which would have paved the way for a large-scale copper mine on sacred Native American land [2], and rejected a case about a student's "There are only two genders" T-shirt [3].

The Atlantic reports the executive branch may be circumventing court orders while maintaining the appearance of compliance [4]. The Guardian suggests the Republican budget bill contains a "hidden measure" that would dramatically increase presidential power [5]. A letter warns that a provision in the House budget bill could block courts from enforcing contempt rulings [6].

## 5. Domestic Policy and Economic Issues

### 5.1 Social Programs

A high-stakes battle is underway in Congress over the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared "Hands off SNAP" on the House floor [1], while Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro criticized Republicans for "ripping away Medicaid and SNAP from Pennsylvanians" [2]. There are concerns that more than 3 million people could lose SNAP benefits under a GOP bill [3].

Work requirements are reportedly "better at blocking benefits for low-income people than they are at helping those folks find jobs" [4]. Multiple outlets suggest the Trump administration plans significant changes to Medicaid, with advisers acknowledging cuts [5]. A program helping 6 million families pay energy bills may also be at risk [6].

### 5.2 Economic Developments

Trump's media company is making a significant cryptocurrency investment, with The Verge reporting plans to "buy $2.5 billion in Bitcoin" [1]. President Trump has stated that the U.S. "will control US Steel as part of Nippon deal" [2]. A study indicates the U.S. could lose $23 billion in GDP and 230,000 jobs if foreign tourists stay away due to tariffs [3]. NPR reports that "Corporate America's retreat from DEI has eliminated thousands of jobs" [4].

## 6. Political Strategies and Electoral Outlook

Politicians are gearing up for the 2026 election cycle. Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville has announced his bid for Alabama governor in 2026 [1]. The Washington Post suggests "A 'Blue Wave' is building" though "It won't look the same as the last one" [2]. Democrats are discussing how to "win back working class and gain young male support" [3].

The Democratic Party appears to be reassessing strategy, with reports the party is "scrambling to fix image" as members acknowledge it has "lost credibility" [4]. Representative Jasmine Crockett has stated Democrats "Will Investigate Trump if They Reclaim the House in the Midterms" [5].
