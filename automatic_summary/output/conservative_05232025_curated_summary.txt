## 2. Economic And Trade Policy

### 2.1 International Trade And Tariffs
President Trump has announced major tariff measures against both the European Union and Apple. The administration has threatened 50% tariffs on European Union goods [1] and a 25% tariff on Apple's iPhones unless they are manufactured in the United States [1, 2]. These actions follow what is characterized as a failure by both Apple and the EU to respond to previous demands [2]. News reporting connects Trump, Apple CEO Tim Cook, tariffs, and major stock indices [3].

The Spectator has published an analysis suggesting that the "EU could pay a high price for not settling with Trump" [4]. The headline implies ongoing negotiations between the Trump administration and the EU, with potentially significant consequences for the European bloc if an agreement isn't reached.

### 2.2 Energy Policy And Government Spending
As Memorial Day weekend approaches, gasoline prices have reached a four-year low [1]. This coincides with the Trump administration's pursuit of what supporters describe as "energy dominance," with commentary suggesting Congress should not impede the President's energy agenda [2].

The Wall Street Journal has reported on potential Senate improvements to the House tax and budget bill, including reducing tax carve-outs such as the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction and implementing further spending reductions and Medicaid reforms [3]. Senator Joni Ernst has reported discovering alleged fraud in federal employee credit card spending totaling $60 billion, including charges at casinos, bars, and for pay-per-view UFC fights [4].

A Colombian national in Massachusetts has been accused of voting illegally in the 2024 election and receiving more than $400,000 in fraudulently obtained federal benefits [5]. Additionally, a significant administrative cleanup of Social Security records has reportedly resulted in 12.3 million deceased individuals being properly marked as deceased in the system [6].
